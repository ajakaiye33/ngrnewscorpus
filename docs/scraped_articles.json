From Owerri in Imo State to Igangan in Oyo State; from Niger to Kaduna and across the states of the North-East, we are witnessing bloodshed and violence of the sort usually associated with war.\n\n\u201cThese are trying times for all (of) our nation\u2019s people. Families are in mourning; communities are under siege and even those who have thus far escaped the direct impact of the escalating violence cannot help but feel as if they are living on borrowed time. We are reminded of the urgent need for coordinated and targeted action by governments at all levels to address this menace and save our nation.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, the House of Representatives hosted a Special Summit on National Security to harness the views of citizens and stakeholders, experts from within and outside, to define a new strategy for combating the different manifestations of insecurity in our country.

          "title": "Eucharia Anunobi: For Gospel & Screen",
          "text": "Eucharia Anunobi is a veteran Nollywood actress who came into limelight after featuring in multiple, award-winning movie, Glamour Girls 2 (1996). The charismatic actress whose conversion to Christ took the industry by storm some years ago, has been in the business of making movies and winning souls for Christ.\n\nEucharia Anunobi who holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Pastoral Leadership from Redeemer\u2019s International Leadership Academy, last Sunday, added a feather to her already decorated hat, when she bagged a PhD in Christian Education and Ministerial Art from Kingdom Life Bible College International, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nIn this interview, Dr. Eucharia Anunobi, Filmmaker, actress and Minister of God, takes us through her world, touching on challenging moments as a Minister of God.\n\nExcerpts;\n\nWhat inspired you to broaden your knowledge in bible school?\n\nI was inspired by the fact that, in life, you need to keep honing your skills, improving yourself and evolving so you can remain relevant and be able to weather the storm, and whatever life throws at you. If life throws you lime, you\u2019ll make lemonade, if it throws you orange, you make orange juice.\n\nNow, a PhD holder, what is expected of you?\n\nI am expected to do more, educating my generation, to see things better, upgrade themselves, and to ensure that I contribute my quota in the educational system. I can become a visiting lecturer or a full-time lecturer in any University of my choice, within or outside Nigeria.\n\nMany people believe filmmaking is worldly and Ministers of God should not be involved in it. How do you balance the two?\n\nWell, it is an unfortunate thing that a lot of people believe filmmaking is worldly and Ministers of God should not be involved. I want to say, first and foremost, everything about the world we live in is worldly! Everything that we see upon the face of the earth came from God. But people began to digress and to do things that do not glorify God. Be that as it may, filmmaking is a mighty platform through which the gospel can be preached. So, I think it\u2019s a wrong notion for people to think and believe that filmmaking is worldly.\n\nIn the book of Genesis chapter one, in the beginning, \u201cthe earth was without form and void.\u201d So, out of all these things that didn\u2019t make sense, that were unbefitting, that had darkness, that ordinarily didn\u2019t look like you\u2019d see something good out of it, God\u2019s spirit, intellect, essence, moved over these things and began to make something out of it. So, invariably, some part of the film industry may be worldly as it were, but that is not a reason why Ministers of God should not be involved. Filmmaking can be used mightily to propagate the gospel of God so that those who cannot read the Bible, can watch it and understand it.\n\nMisconceptions about the Holy Bible can be cleared when the word of God is translated and put in film format. So, filmmaking is a medium that Ministers of God should embrace, to propagate the gospel, so that the layman can understand by just watching it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Ministers of God, Pastors, Bishops, Apostles like myself, Doctors like myself getting involved in acting or making films. film making. Let us not forget, God makes something out of the seemingly unbefitting things. So, while others may be worldly in whatever they are doing, as Ministers of the gospel, let\u2019s distinguish ourselves and be different.\n\nA movie set is often a complicated setting where clashes of egos, anger and other excesses by cast and crew are likely to happen. In the light of your new reality as an Evangelist, how do you now handle such excesses from others compared to how you handled such in the past?\n\nWell, to the glory of God, it\u2019s been 10 years since I was ordained. So, it is not a new reality anymore. But I have the spirit of truth, the spirit of love, which comes from having our minds renewed. So, in such cases, no matter what is happening, we are meant to exhibit the fruit of the spirit and try to broker peace.\n\nHow have you been using films as a tool for evangelism?\n\nProducers who write scripts that are faith-based call me to act in most of them. That has been a means of propagating the gospel. That way, people can watch the movie and have the gospel broken down for them in pictures. Apart from that, our daily lifestyle, my daily lifestyle of showing love, of forgiving quickly, of trying to make amends, of trying to be more understanding, of apologizing quickly when you have done wrong; all these are ways of evangelizing.\n\nWhat have been some of your challenging moments as a Minister of God, actress and filmmaker?\n\nOne such challenge is when people assume that as an actress or filmmaker, you cannot also be a prophet or a vessel for God to use to bless people. I want to say to the glory of God, I\u2019m bringing a change in the narrative. I am becoming a trailblazer to changing the dynamics of how people see artistes, actresses or filmmakers. I am changing the narrative for them to see that yes, one can be an actress or a filmmaker, and can also be a great vessel of honour. If you studiously fine tune yourself and lay yourself at the feet of God, hear from Him, live according to His principles, be a great minister of the gospel, over time, people will now learn to know and see that there is no area of life in terms of career or profession that God cannot use. There are doctors, teachers, engineers who are Pastors. So, who said and who is saying that an actress, actor or filmmaker cannot also be a pastor? Be that as it may, if that has been the mindset of people, well, God is saying that I\u2019m changing the dynamics and narrative through my daughter, Apostle-Doctor Eucharia Anunobi.\n\nAs an actress, you are expected to be able to interpret any role. What are the roles you would rather not take now because of your status as a Minister in the church?\n\nWell, as an actress, I\u2019m supposed to interpret every role that is assigned to me because if one decides not to do the job, some other actor will take on the job. However, as an Apostle, even others who don\u2019t have that title or status, there are some roles they would not take. So, as much as I would act in every role as long as it\u2019s going to give out a message of reconciliation and informing the people, roles that have to do with me drinking alcohol, I may not take. Also, any other role that would require undue exposure of the body, I would not want to partake of it because even prior to when I became born again, and before I got ordained, I also didn\u2019t take on roles where there was an unnecessary exposure of the body.\n\nWhat guides the type of roles you accept?\n\nI must ensure it has a good storyline and that the story and the roles have a message to pass to the audience because two major things expected of any movie is that it should be entertaining and it should be educating. So, these are the things I watch out for before I accept any role.\n\nSince being ordained as an Evangelist, are there new insights you have gained about life and your profession?\n\nWell, before and after ordination, to the glory of God, I\u2019ve always had a very intimate relationship with God. It is through this intimate relationship that I understand that in life, for you to make it, for you to rise, for you to know what you want, you need to be close to God and have fellowship with Him. It is in the closeness and fellowship with God that I got to understand that whatever you do and do very well, it will bring you before kings.\n\nGenerally, when a person gives his or her life to God, the eyes of wisdom opens unto you, and it helps you to know how to talk and make right career decisions. It helps you in practically every area of your life.\n\nYou are one of the veterans of Nollywood that is still active in the industry today. What are the changes you would like to see?\n\nI\u2019d like to see us paid better. I also would want more financiers to come into the industry because; this is an industry that needs money for it to operate. Sponsors should come in, the government should enact laws to protect the literary contents of producers and the writers. Government should put structures in place that would give us an enabling environment to function, to produce the movies and above all, to ensure that persons who have laboured ceaselessly in the industry are truly honoured.\n\nWill you consider giving marriage another shot?\n\nSure. I would like to get married. I\u2019m looking forward to getting married. I believe it will happen in the fullness of time because God has already said that it is not good for a man to be alone. I\u2019m single and looking. So, if you have anybody who loves or likes me, and feels that I\u2019m the woman of his dreams, please bring him.\n\nWhat do you look out for in a potential suitor?\n\nThe Bible says, \u201cdo not be unequally yoked with the unbelievers\u201d, darkness cannot mix with light. You cannot be someone who likes music and want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t like music, it will not work. You have to complement each other. As an academician, I would also want someone educated and enlightened. Someone who has an open mindset, someone who loves education and knowledge as much as I do, and who is romantic.

          "text": "Eucharia Anunobi is a veteran Nollywood actress who came into limelight after featuring in multiple, award-winning movie, Glamour Girls 2 (1996). The charismatic actress whose conversion to Christ took the industry by storm some years ago, has been in the business of making movies and winning souls for Christ.\n\nEucharia Anunobi who holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Pastoral Leadership from Redeemer\u2019s International Leadership Academy, last Sunday, added a feather to her already decorated hat, when she bagged a PhD in Christian Education and Ministerial Art from Kingdom Life Bible College International, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nIn this interview, Dr. Eucharia Anunobi, Filmmaker, actress and Minister of God, takes us through her world, touching on challenging moments as a Minister of God.\n\nExcerpts;\n\nWhat inspired you to broaden your knowledge in bible school?\n\nI was inspired by the fact that, in life, you need to keep honing your skills, improving yourself and evolving so you can remain relevant and be able to weather the storm, and whatever life throws at you. If life throws you lime, you\u2019ll make lemonade, if it throws you orange, you make orange juice.\n\nNow, a PhD holder, what is expected of you?\n\nI am expected to do more, educating my generation, to see things better, upgrade themselves, and to ensure that I contribute my quota in the educational system. I can become a visiting lecturer or a full-time lecturer in any University of my choice, within or outside Nigeria.\n\nMany people believe filmmaking is worldly and Ministers of God should not be involved in it. How do you balance the two?\n\nWell, it is an unfortunate thing that a lot of people believe filmmaking is worldly and Ministers of God should not be involved. I want to say, first and foremost, everything about the world we live in is worldly! Everything that we see upon the face of the earth came from God. But people began to digress and to do things that do not glorify God. Be that as it may, filmmaking is a mighty platform through which the gospel can be preached. So, I think it\u2019s a wrong notion for people to think and believe that filmmaking is worldly.\n\nIn the book of Genesis chapter one, in the beginning, \u201cthe earth was without form and void.\u201d So, out of all these things that didn\u2019t make sense, that were unbefitting, that had darkness, that ordinarily didn\u2019t look like you\u2019d see something good out of it, God\u2019s spirit, intellect, essence, moved over these things and began to make something out of it. So, invariably, some part of the film industry may be worldly as it were, but that is not a reason why Ministers of God should not be involved. Filmmaking can be used mightily to propagate the gospel of God so that those who cannot read the Bible, can watch it and understand it.\n\nMisconceptions about the Holy Bible can be cleared when the word of God is translated and put in film format. So, filmmaking is a medium that Ministers of God should embrace, to propagate the gospel, so that the layman can understand by just watching it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Ministers of God, Pastors, Bishops, Apostles like myself, Doctors like myself getting involved in acting or making films. film making. Let us not forget, God makes something out of the seemingly unbefitting things. So, while others may be worldly in whatever they are doing, as Ministers of the gospel, let\u2019s distinguish ourselves and be different.\n\nA movie set is often a complicated setting where clashes of egos, anger and other excesses by cast and crew are likely to happen. In the light of your new reality as an Evangelist, how do you now handle such excesses from others compared to how you handled such in the past?\n\nWell, to the glory of God, it\u2019s been 10 years since I was ordained. So, it is not a new reality anymore. But I have the spirit of truth, the spirit of love, which comes from having our minds renewed. So, in such cases, no matter what is happening, we are meant to exhibit the fruit of the spirit and try to broker peace.\n\nHow have you been using films as a tool for evangelism?\n\nProducers who write scripts that are faith-based call me to act in most of them. That has been a means of propagating the gospel. That way, people can watch the movie and have the gospel broken down for them in pictures. Apart from that, our daily lifestyle, my daily lifestyle of showing love, of forgiving quickly, of trying to make amends, of trying to be more understanding, of apologizing quickly when you have done wrong; all these are ways of evangelizing.\n\nWhat have been some of your challenging moments as a Minister of God, actress and filmmaker?\n\nOne such challenge is when people assume that as an actress or filmmaker, you cannot also be a prophet or a vessel for God to use to bless people. I want to say to the glory of God, I\u2019m bringing a change in the narrative. I am becoming a trailblazer to changing the dynamics of how people see artistes, actresses or filmmakers. I am changing the narrative for them to see that yes, one can be an actress or a filmmaker, and can also be a great vessel of honour. If you studiously fine tune yourself and lay yourself at the feet of God, hear from Him, live according to His principles, be a great minister of the gospel, over time, people will now learn to know and see that there is no area of life in terms of career or profession that God cannot use. There are doctors, teachers, engineers who are Pastors. So, who said and who is saying that an actress, actor or filmmaker cannot also be a pastor? Be that as it may, if that has been the mindset of people, well, God is saying that I\u2019m changing the dynamics and narrative through my daughter, Apostle-Doctor Eucharia Anunobi.\n\nAs an actress, you are expected to be able to interpret any role. What are the roles you would rather not take now because of your status as a Minister in the church?\n\nWell, as an actress, I\u2019m supposed to interpret every role that is assigned to me because if one decides not to do the job, some other actor will take on the job. However, as an Apostle, even others who don\u2019t have that title or status, there are some roles they would not take. So, as much as I would act in every role as long as it\u2019s going to give out a message of reconciliation and informing the people, roles that have to do with me drinking alcohol, I may not take. Also, any other role that would require undue exposure of the body, I would not want to partake of it because even prior to when I became born again, and before I got ordained, I also didn\u2019t take on roles where there was an unnecessary exposure of the body.\n\nWhat guides the type of roles you accept?\n\nI must ensure it has a good storyline and that the story and the roles have a message to pass to the audience because two major things expected of any movie is that it should be entertaining and it should be educating. So, these are the things I watch out for before I accept any role.\n\nSince being ordained as an Evangelist, are there new insights you have gained about life and your profession?\n\nWell, before and after ordination, to the glory of God, I\u2019ve always had a very intimate relationship with God. It is through this intimate relationship that I understand that in life, for you to make it, for you to rise, for you to know what you want, you need to be close to God and have fellowship with Him. It is in the closeness and fellowship with God that I got to understand that whatever you do and do very well, it will bring you before kings.\n\nGenerally, when a person gives his or her life to God, the eyes of wisdom opens unto you, and it helps you to know how to talk and make right career decisions. It helps you in practically every area of your life.\n\nYou are one of the veterans of Nollywood that is still active in the industry today. What are the changes you would like to see?\n\nI\u2019d like to see us paid better. I also would want more financiers to come into the industry because; this is an industry that needs money for it to operate. Sponsors should come in, the government should enact laws to protect the literary contents of producers and the writers. Government should put structures in place that would give us an enabling environment to function, to produce the movies and above all, to ensure that persons who have laboured ceaselessly in the industry are truly honoured.\n\nWill you consider giving marriage another shot?\n\nSure. I would like to get married. I\u2019m looking forward to getting married. I believe it will happen in the fullness of time because God has already said that it is not good for a man to be alone. I\u2019m single and looking. So, if you have anybody who loves or likes me, and feels that I\u2019m the woman of his dreams, please bring him.\n\nWhat do you look out for in a potential suitor?\n\nThe Bible says, \u201cdo not be unequally yoked with the unbelievers\u201d, darkness cannot mix with light. You cannot be someone who likes music and want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t like music, it will not work. You have to complement each other. As an academician, I would also want someone educated and enlightened. Someone who has an open mindset, someone who loves education and knowledge as much as I do, and who is romantic. He should have the fear of God, and hold the things of God sacred, has the consciousness of heaven and lastly, someone who has a mind of his own, who would respect me and who loves humanity like I do.\n\nYou have held your own as a fashionable actress. How would you describe your style?\n\nThank you for the compliment. Well, my style is about class and elegance. I love my clothes to be fitting, nice, comfortable and classy. I do not wear things because people are wearing them. I create my style to suit my personality. Let me give an insight; because I am a preacher who is always on the go, if I have to be on the altar, I will not want to have hairstyles that have strands flying all over the places. So, I\u2019ve created the unique afro hair style that everybody now knows as my style.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s convenient and it doesn\u2019t get in the way. My style doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be what\u2019s in vogue because what is in vogue today, may not be in vogue tomorrow. My style is about wearing what flatters my body.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI relax by reading, dancing. I also relax by doing exercises, watching people, and meditating.\n\nWhere is your favourite relaxation location?\n\nMy favourite relaxation location is America; on the beach and walking through the parks.",

          "text": "The plight and injustices which many vulnerable people go through and how to ensure that their rights are protected was brought to the fore at a consultative meeting, which held recently in Lagos, by the Rights Enforcement and Public Law Centre (REPLACE), with the support of the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (ROLAC) and civil organisations on \u201cAccess to Justice for Vulnerable Persons.\u201d\n\n\n\nStakeholders at the meeting submitted that women, children and people with disability are the most vulnerable groups in any society, with their rights often been infringed upon, while many do not have access to justice. They also noted that in the case of arrest, detention and trial, these vulnerable groups suffer human rights infringement.\n\nThe meeting focused on the importance of the Police Duty Solicitor Scheme (PDSS) and how to ensure the scheme become effective and implemented across the country to ensure access to justice for women and people with disability.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Executive Director, REPLACE, Felicitas Aigbogun-Brai explained that the seminar became imperative in order to get the input of people on the field in providing legal services for women, PWDs based on their knowledge and to give robust document to the police. Adding that there is need to change the narrative on how the police treat women and PWDs arrested.\n\n\u201cIn detention, there should be provision of sanitary pad for women. The way you treat a woman is different from man. People should be treated with dignity,\u201d she said.\n\nOn how PDSS has effected change in the legal system, Aigbogun-Brai said \u201cthere is now Family Support Unit in Lagos police. There is a slight change in how they treat victims of domestic violence and sexual offences, but for others, no change.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chibogu Obinwa, ROLAC Gender Specialist said the organisation believes in human rights especially that of women and PWDs, hence, the need to look into the PDSS and see how it would assist the work of legal service providers and civil society organisations in ensuring access to justice for vulnerable people.\n\nAlso speaking at the vent, Iyabo Akingbade, Legal Aid Council, Lagos State Coordinator, stated that a lot has happened in the legal system in Nigeria and that the police are now on their toes.\n\nRepresented by Grace Adenubi, Assistant Director, Legal Aid Council, Akingbade said the essence of the Police Duty Solicitor Scheme is not to monitor the police but to ensure that there is compliance with the rights of the people and to promote legal and human rights of suspects, and not to torture them while in detention.\n\nWhile stressing that there should be consistence and awareness, she stated that there is police advisory committee to ensure the scheme works, such as \u201cto ensure the law works and that \u2018bail is free\u2019 is not only on paper. Doing so will put the police in better light and someone will not be afraid to go to the police station\u201d, she noted.\n\n\u201cPolice duty is to cooperate and ensure the scheme works. They are to give access to meet and interview the suspects. Solicitors are to look at the cell environment, whether their rights are being infringed upon. There should be a follow up to know compliance,\u201d she said.\n\nIn broadening the discourse, participants were divided into groups to formulate a communique on guidelines for the police on women, PWDs in detention as well as legal service providers.\n\nThe organisers noted that communique from the group activities would serve as part of the training document for civil society organisations, the police and senior officers at the station level to spread the awareness to other officers.",

          "text": "Popular pastors in Nigeria have until this moment, refused to react to the sudden death of their colleague in the \u2018kingdom assignment\u2019, Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua.\n\nT.B Joshua, a leading pastor in Nigeria, and Africa including Asia, whose prowess in performing miracles brought tourists from around Europe, America and other continents of the world to Lagos, was confirmed dead on Sunday morning.\n\nThe cleric was said to have died after concluding a programme at the Synagogue Church Of All Nations on Saturday, sending a shock wave to his members and others alike.\n\nHowever, politicians, friends, and well-wishers as well as those who did not seem to like his ministry, have used different means to condole and sympathise with the deceased family and his church.\n\nSCOAN Church confirms TB Joshua\u2019s death, last words\n\nBut some notable \u2018men of God\u2019 in the land, such as leaders of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye; Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor W.F Kumuyi, Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo, Dunamis Church, Pastor Paul Enenche, Pastor Chris Oyakilome, Pastor Chris Okotie, to mention but a few, have refused to acknowledge the death of T.B Joshua.\n\nRecall that when Dare, one of the sons of Pastor Adeboye died, T. B Joshua was one of the first Pastors to send his condolences and went on to observe a minute silence for the 43-year-old pastor during his church service.\n\nJoshua had in a message of condolence to Pastor Adeboye and the Redeemed Christian Church Of God (RCCG), said the sad event would not had happened if God did not permit it, adding that He needed no human\u2019s approval to His will.\n\n\u201cGod does not need our permit; God\u2019s time is the best,\u201d the cleric said in a live broadcast on Emmanuel TV.\n\n\u201cIt is not how long we live that matters but how well we live,\u201d he added\n\nThe reason these Pentecostal pastors have been quiet over Joshua\u2019s death is not yet clear but one thing is certain; the late cleric until his death, was not a member of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, neither was he a member of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN.\n\nAs Apostle Suleman Johnson of the Omega Fire Ministries, Edo State, had suggested, there may have been a misunderstanding between Joshua and some of these top preachers. Addressing his congregants on June 7, 2021, Suleman had said, \u201cProphet T.B Joshua is too small.\n\nT.B Joshua: Profile of popular Nigerian prophet, controversies that surrounded his ministry\n\n\u201cAnd my problem is that when I respond, I respond raw. I don\u2019t edit. You are too small. The Synagogue is too small. Too small. I cannot fight\u2026Church cannot fight Church. None of my pastors has followed me to my father in the Lord. Me, I book months before I see him. Then I carried a frustrated fat-bodied baboon to go and meet who? There\u2019s no mountain on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. You\u2019re sick! What I don\u2019t understand is, was it a mistake? \u2026\u201d\n\nBut even at that, some Nigerians who spoke to DAILY POST on this matter shared a diverse opinion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not biblical for anyone to hold grudges against their fellow human being even unto death. Although they might have sent their condolences to the family and Church without making it public. If there was a face-off between Joshua and Adeboye for instance, the former did not harbour it in his mind because immediately he learnt about Dare\u2019s death, he sympathised with the RCCG leader,\u201d Rebecca Akpan, a member of Assemblies of God, told our reporter.\n\nAccording to Emmanuel Oche, \u201cI\u2019m sensing enmity, acrimony and envy among these pastors against the late Joshua. These top pastors are mainly known in Nigeria while T.B Joshua brought foreigners Nigeria. So, some of them might have felt belittled and this might have made them to develop everlasting hatred for him.\u201d\n\nChidinma Ebuha believes that most of these pastors did not believe in T.B Joshua\u2019s miracles. Although I\u2019m not a believer of these miracles but, I really don\u2019t think they should ignore him in death because of this. If my enemy dies, I will still condole with the family. It goes to tell you how Nigerian pastors operate. There\u2019s so much hatred among them. God help us. The question is, would Jesus Christ had done the same?\u201d\n\nWhatever be the case, Nigerians are of the opinion that even though the cleric was denied membership by the leadership of CAN and PFN, individual pastors, who are members of both organisations, had the rights to condole with the grieving family and members of the Synagogue Church.\n\nRecall that Rev. Chris Okotie, the Shepherd Superintendent of the Household of God Church, on Tuesday morning shared a cryptic post on his Facebook page in which he referenced a certain \u201dwizard of Endor\u201d who assumed the title of \u201dEmmanuel\u201d.\n\nThe clergyman in his post said the wizard who assumed the title of Emmanuel had been consumed by divine indignation. This, to many, was a veiled reference to the death of the acclaimed Prophet.\n\nT.B Joshua: How late Synagogue pastor planned to celebrate birthday on Saturday",

          "text": "Retired boxer, Mike Tyson has made some sterling revelation on how he had to sleep with a female prison warder in order to reduce his six years prison sentence.\n\nRecall that the prime of his career, Tyson was arrested for raping an 18-year-old beauty pageant contestant. Although he maintains his innocence, Tyson was convicted in 1992 and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nThe boxing legend in an interview with vladtv.com said that he slept with a prison counselor in order to reduce his prison sentence during the time he was arrested for raping an 18-year-old beauty pageant contestant. Although he pleaded not guilty to the charge, he was still incarcerated for six years but apparently, Mike had a way of dealing with the situation.\n\nSpeaking about his life in prison, he said he was supposed to spend 4 years and needed to pass the GED (General Educational Development) in order to reduce the term, so he helped himself by dating the counselor.\n\nHe said; \u201cI got in trouble like the first six months and stuff, cursing, getting written up. And then by that time, I got the hang of the place. \u2018Hey, I know how to do this.\u2019 Next thing you know, I\u2019m dating one of the counsel workers now, she\u2019s letting me have sex with her now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tyson, he got another year tacked onto his sentence because he was so hard to deal with initially.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going good. But the first six months I was getting write-ups, I have to pay that year back. \u2026 I\u2019m like a star pupil prisoner. Trusty, everything. Then, \u2018Hey Mike, remember the first six months you were a prick?\u2019 Boom. They gave me another year,\u201d he added.\n\nHe continued; \u201cSo by passing the GED they took that year away.\n\n\u201cSo I flunked the f*cking GED \u2026 and got mad, and so I had to start dating this counselor and stuff, giving her money and doing really some nasty stuff to her, and she let me pass this test.\u201d\n\nAs he expected, the prison took the year off of Tyson\u2019s sentence and he was able to go home in three years.",

          "text": "There is an indication the Department of State Services (DSS) may have rescinded its decision to invite fiery Catholic priest and spiritual director of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka to Abuja for interrogation.\n\nMbaka had last Sunday told worshippers at the Adoration Ground that operatives of the DSS visited the church to deliver the letter of invitation but did not meet him.\n\nThe operatives were said to have been told to come on Monday when they would meet the priest.\n\nBut checks at the Adoration Ground by The Nation on Tuesday showed the secret security operatives did not show up on Monday neither did they come on Tuesday to deliver their letter.\n\nThis, it was learnt, is fueling speculations that the DSS may have dropped the summons.\n\nOne of the security men at the Emene ground, who preferred anonymity, told our correspondent that Fr. Mbaka was in office on Monday and Tuesday but did not see anyone with such invitation letter.\n\n\u201cI have been here since yesterday and I have not seen anyone coming to deliver any letter. Father (Mbaka) has been in his office. He is not running away.\n\n\u201cSo, anyone who wants to see him is free. But, we have not seen anyone coming to deliver any letter to him,\u201d the man said.\n\nDetails of why the intelligence unit had wanted to summon the priest were not stated but it might not be unconnected with Mbaka\u2019s criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration in recent times.\n\nThe priest recently said God had rejected the President and unhappy with his leadership.\n\nBut the Catholic Diocese of Enugu has said that it would only react to the invitation by the DSS if it sees its contents.\n\nSpokesman of the diocese, Rev. Fr. Benjamin Achi, said: \u201cMbaka is our priest and we would do anything to protect him. But in this case, we cannot talk about people we don\u2019t know and didn\u2019t see.\n\n\u201cAll we know about it was what Fr Mbaka said that the DSS came.

But nothing is too difficult for God to do. That is why we are here,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cWe have some challenges. These are beyond what we can handle. We have to cry out to God to help us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Onaiyekan has urged Nigerians to put elected leaders on their toes and hold them accountable.\n\nHe stated this at the North Central Zonal Dialogue Conference, organised by Lux Terra Leadership Foundation, in partnership with Savannah Centre for Diplomacy, Democracy and Development.\n\n\u201cNigerians have gotten used to just sitting and complaining about everything. They complain about government and politicians but they do not take their role of citizen participation seriously. The leaders are happy about this and take full advantage of the docile nature of most Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, it is only when Nigerians actively use their right of citizen participation in governance that the leaders will be on their toes and live up to their responsibilities.\n\nThe cleric reminded leaders that once they took their oath of office with either Bible or Quran, they had put themselves under the judgment of God.\n\nAnother panelist, Mr Bola Abimbola, Executive Director of Savannah Centre, noted that some of the problems in the country stemmed from a trust-deficit between government and citizens.\n\nAbimbola, represented by Mr Felix Pwol, a Director at the centre, said it was imperative for government to focus on achieving national unity, national security, women and youth development as well as civil society and government partnership.\n\nExecutive Director of Lux Terra, Rev. Fr. George Ehusani, said that the conference was a response to the ongoing widespread call for dialogue towards resolving Nigeria\u2019s worsening socio-economic, political and security challenges.\n\nPanelists at the conference included: Prof. Olugbemiro Jegede, pioneer Vice-Chancellor, National Open University and Mr Audu Ogbeh, a former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nOthers were: Mr Labaran Maku, a former Minister of Information, Eugenia Abu, a retired staffer of Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) and Mrs Ene Edeh, a rights activist.\n\nParticipants were drawn from the six states of the North-Central geo-political zone: Benue, Kogi, Kwara, Nassarawa, Niger and Plateau.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, yesterday, at Igangan, vowed to do everything possible to ensure massacre by criminal herdsmen never happen again.\n\nAddressing members of the community, he said: \u201cI promise you this is the last time anything like this will ever happen here. It is a promise I am making to you and it is a promise I will come through with.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take law into your hands. I appeal to all those that lost loved ones because sometimes, the emotion can be really high, give us the opportunity to resolve this and make this place safer for you. You can see the light-up project that we are carrying out, it is for us to be able to see everywhere, whether it is day or night. There are people that do not want progress for our community, for our state and for our country. But I have faith that God will have mercy on us, our state and our country.\n\n\u201cSo, I appeal to you, give us the opportunity to come back, rebuild things and put in a more solid architecture, such that you will be able to go to your farms and do your business without fear of anything.\n\n\u201cBut I should be held accountable. I am responsible for this and I will do everything within my power to ensure it would not happen again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Makinde called on the Federal Government to permit governors in the South West to equip Amotekun Corps with sophisticated weapons, such as AK-47, to tackle rising insecurity, especially banditry and kidnapping in the geo-political zone.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the massacre of more than 10 persons in Igangan, Ibarapa zone of Oyo State on Saturday night by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, who residents of Ibarapa claimed had threatened many weeks ago that they would strike, and eventually struck.\n\nMakinde made the call in a keynote address during the opening of a two-day 2021 Governor Seyi Makinde National Democracy Summit, with the theme: \u2018The Future of Democracy in Nigeria\u2019, at the International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan.\n\nMakinde, who left the summit midway for Igangan, expressed frustration on the challenges being faced by governors that are called chief security officers but cannot ask federal security agencies in their respective states to attend to security situation without them getting clearance from Abuja.\n\nThe governor said the only way out is for the Federal Government to allow state police for states to take charge of peculiar security challenges confronting them individually, adding that the state should be given power at the same time to control the natural resources in their states.\n\n\u201cWith what happened at Igangan, the people can hold me responsible for letting them down and when I go there, I will take responsibility because those killings were really needless. Even though I continue to take responsibility for the security situation in Oyo State, we all know that, in reality, the commissioner of police has to wait for orders from \u2018above\u2019 before taking specific actions to benefit the local population.\n\n\u201cSo, looking at the federal security agencies here in Oyo State, they have to get clearance from the federal. We will continue to do our best. Here in the South West, we were able to kickstart Amotekun. But even with Amotekun, people ask how the killings happened. Were they not there? But we have several limitations to what Amotekun can do and even the firearms they can carry.\n\n\u201cYou have dane guns and you are faced with people carrying AK-47. If it is in terms of investment, if we are given the authority, I will also buy AK-47 for Amotekun, if given the licence,\u201d he said.\n\nMakinde said the people should appreciate that \u201cstate policing is a sure cure to our national development challenges. Anyone who has been involved in security at any level will tell you that policing is local. One of the reasons the Western Nigeria Security Network, code-named Amotekun, is recording success is because members of the corps are drawn from the locality. They know the terrain and so can gather needed intelligence. Also, they can be held accountable by the local people because they know them.\n\n\u201cSo, when state governors become the actual chief security officers in charge of the security personnel in their states, they can quickly respond to security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But our federalism exists in name only. Students of political history will tell you that what we have been practising is, in fact, a unitary system of government \u2013 where more powers are concentrated in the central government. Another thing that our political theorists will tell you is that by nature, a unitary system of government is better suited for small countries.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not a small country. So, you can easily identify why we are experiencing developmental challenges across the board. We are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. For true federalism to thrive, the federating units should have more powers and autonomy. The government at the centre serves as a coordinator of assets but does not wield as much power,\u201d Makinde said..",

Anyone that has lost a close relative knows what it means to lose parents or children. I am more concerned about the lives lost because of the trickle down effects on families.\n\n\u201cOur people are not known for burning homes to punish enemies. Destroying police stations and infrastructures can never be the best path to express grievances. Whenever the 1967 to 1970 civil war is mentioned, it\u2019s an emotive experience for any peace-loving Nigerian not just an Igbo man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should not either by words or actions pursue a repetition of that horrible genocide. We should come to understand that every war ends on a table. Instead of destructions before coming to the table, is it not wiser to come to table and avoid destruction? We need infrastructure, we need investments, we don\u2019t need hostilities. So, we are pleading with you to stop and embrace peace,\u201d Kalu said.\n\nOn the killing of innocent young people, Kalu called on the security agencies to desist from harassment, molestation and killing of innocent young people in the region.\n\nHe said he was worried that some security agents have been reported to be killing innocent souls.\n\n\u201cIt is better to thoroughly conduct your investigations and avoid the indiscriminate killings of young innocent Igbo men. Our people have raised the alarm and we are very worried at the rate of disappearance and deaths of innocent young men. Some of our young people now live indoors for the fear of being tagged unknown gunman,\u201d Kalu said.\n\nHe also reaffirmed his call for a national dialogue chaired by the president and said the need for a national dialogue was to douse tension in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way, our entanglement is so deep that all we need is diligent and deliberate efforts to realise the great dividends of diversity and pluralism.\n\n\u201cOur unity is our strength and can forever live in unity notwithstanding the diversity in culture, religion and tongues. A dialogue that has all stakeholders on the table and with the president as chairman, will go a long way in dousing tension across the regions,\u201d Kalu said.",

Former military generals and prominent persons will come. These former leaders are working on this summit and they\u2019ll find a solution to the problems of Nigeria. Those attacking our people are foreigners who have been given the opportunity to come in and kill our people.

          "text": "\u2022FG directs workers to resume work or face sanctions\n\nChuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe insistence of state governors to rely on the 45-day window provided in their agreement with the judicial and parliamentary workers for the implementation of its terms may prolong the ongoing strike by the workers, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is coming as the federal government has directed members of the striking Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria(JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria(PASAN) to urgently reopen all the courts and the state Houses of Assembly so that the May 20, 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA), signed by all parties on June 4, can take effect.\n\nHowever, the National Executive Committees (NECs) of the two unions will hold emergency meetings today to decide on the next line of action.\n\nThe federal government had three weeks ago brokered an agreement between the governors and the workers to end their 10-week-old strike.\n\nUnder the agreement, the governors were given 45-day window, with effect from the date of the agreement, to implement its terms.\n\nHowever, while the representatives of the workers promptly signed the agreement under the supervision of the Minister of Employment, Labour and Productivity, Dr. Chris Ngige, the representatives of the governors only endorsed the document last Friday.\n\nBut one of the conditions given by the workers to call off the strike was that while the agreement is being implemented, the governors should first release their May statutory allocations directly to them immediately after the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), held last month.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that after signing the agreements, the governors have not released the allocations due to the judiciary and the legislative arms of government.\n\nA source told THISDAY that the delay in releasing the allocations to the two arms of government in line with their financial autonomy status provided by the constitution was due to the inability of the states to immediately set up a State Allocation Accounts Committee (SAAC) and the State Houses of Assembly Services Commission in their respective states.\n\nThe setting up of SAAC and State Houses of Assembly Services Commission was also part of the agreement reached between the striking workers and the governors.\n\nThe source said the inability to set up these bodies immediately was the major reason stalling the release of funds to both arms of government.\n\nWhile the workers have demanded the immediate release of the allocations for them to call off the strike, the source stated that the governors are utilising the 45-day window provided in the agreement to implement the terms, including the release of the funds.\n\nHe added that some states have not set up SAAC and the State Assembly Services Commission for the various commissioners of finance and the representatives of the Conference of Speakers of State Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe governors are desirous of releasing the funds to the states\u2019 judiciaries and the legislatures, but these organs have to be set up first to become the avenue to moderate the disbursements of the funds like it is done with the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\u201cThe governors were given a 45-day deadline to set up these organs to enable implementation.\n\nTherefore, it is after the expiration of this 45 days that one can say that the governors don\u2019t want to honour the agreement with the judicial and the legislative workers.\n\n\u201cFor now, all processes are in motion and the necessary organs would be set up to ensure proper implementation as per the agreement.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEvery state will have to set up the SAAC and the State Assembly Services Commission. It is here the details of what every state has to pay to the legislature and the judiciary is to be worked out based on the agreed percentage.\n\n\u201cThe mode of payment is based on a percentage of the revenue generated by each state and not based on the total budget of the state.\n\n\u201cWho will receive necessary funds without the SAAC? So, let the proper thing be done. The governors are within the terms of the agreement reached.\u201d\n\nFG Directs Workers to Resume Work or Face Sanctions\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has directed members of the striking JUSUN and the PASAN to reopen all the courts and the state Houses of Assembly so that the May 20, 2021 Memorandum of Action, signed by all parties on June 4, can take effect.\n\nThe government said it might invoke sections of the Trade Disputes Acts if the strike continued.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Abuja, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, decried the situation where the courts and the state Houses of Assembly are still shut for no cogent reasons.\n\nHe said going by the provisions of the May 20 Memorandum of Action, states had 45 days implementation window.\n\nThe statement, signed by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Mr. Charles Akpan, said: \u201cThe federal government has sadly noted that the MOA between all the stakeholders involved in the JUSUN/ PASAN strike, mainly JUSUN/PASAN, Governors\u2019 Forum and the Presidential Implementation Committee is yet to take effect because of non-compliance by parties.\n\n\u201cWe note that the strike has not been called off as of noon, today, June 8, 2021, leading to courts and various state Houses of Assembly still remaining under lock and key contrary to the promise made by the two unions at a further dialogue, which was attended by the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC).\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all federal courts have remained closed notwithstanding the fact that the federal level of government operates a financial autonomy for the judiciary through the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the National Assembly through the statutory transfer lines.\u201d\n\nNgige, however, said that he had advised all governors that have consulted with their heads of judiciaries and legislatures to go ahead and credit the accounts of judiciaries and legislatures before fine-tuning the laws.\n\nThe statement added that many governors are desirous that the state Houses of Assembly be opened so that they can enact the laws meant to give effect to the autonomy as enshrined in the MOA.\n\n\u201cWe are worried and therefore wish to appeal for the last time to all parties involved in the signed agreement to abide by its spirit and letters, by firstly re-opening all the courts and the state Houses of Assembly so that all other ingredients in the MOA can be given full compliance by all parties concerned.\n\n\u201cThis much was agreed to between JUSUN/ PASSAN and the governors\u2019 forum at the last meeting on Friday, June 4, 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister added that with the courts closed , the police and other security agencies cannot prosecute criminals.\n\nThe statement said that the ministry would not be happy to be pushed into invoking sections of the Trade Disputes Acts capable of eroding all the gains made so far in the negotiations since May 6, 2021.\n\nWorkers Hold Emergency Meeting Today\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the NECs of both unions will meet separately today in Abuja to reconsider issues that led to the over two-month- old industrial action.\n\nIt was learnt that the NEC meetings would be held to get the views of members of the two unions on whether or not to suspend the strike.\n\nDeputy President of JUSUN, Mr. Emmanuel Abisoye, told THISDAY yesterday that the NEC meeting would review the progress made so far in the agitation for financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nReacting to the threat by Ngige, Abisoye said the union had not done any wrong to warrant any threat from the government.\n\nAccording to him, it is the state governors who have failed to implement the provisions of the Memorandum of Action that such threat should be directed at.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "W\u2019Bank Raises GDP Growth Forecast for Nigeria to 1.8%",
          "text": "By Obinna Chima in Lagos and Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has increased Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection for 2021 to 1.8 per cent, higher than the 1.1 per cent it had estimated for the country earlier this year.\n\nThe Washington-based institution, in its June 2021 Global Economic Prospect released yesterday, also forecast the GDP growth to hit 2.1 per cent for the country in 2022, compared with the 1.8 per cent it had predicted for Nigeria in the earlier report released in January.\n\nNigeria recorded a GDP growth rate of 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020, according to figures the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released last month.\n\nBut the World Bank hinged its positive prediction for Nigeria on the expectation that crude oil prices would remain high as well as the government effecting structural reforms and flexible exchange rate management.\n\nIt said: \u201cGrowth in Nigeria is expected to resume at 1.8 per cent in 2021 and edge up to 2.1 per cent next year, assuming higher oil prices, structural oil sector reforms, and market-based flexible exchange rate management.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that output in Sub-Saharan Africa shrank at an estimated 2.4 per cent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a milder-than-expected recession.\n\nIt added that growth in the region has gradually resumed this year, which it stated was a reflection of positive spillovers from strengthening global economic activity, including higher oil and metal prices, and some progress in containing COVID-19, especially in Western and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has contributed to wider budget deficits and a spike in government debt, heightening the risk of debt distress in some countries. Activity in the three largest economies\u2014Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa\u2014 has partially recovered.\n\n\u201cMany industrial and agricultural commodity exporting countries experienced deep contractions last year. In tourism reliant countries, international arrivals have been at a near-halt, and tourism is likely to remain slow until wider vaccination permits safe reopening to international travel.\n\n\u201cDespite improvement, COVID-19 has continued to have adverse impacts on health, schooling, investment, and economic growth,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the report, in some countries such as Angola and Nigeria, accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, currency depreciations, and rising food and energy prices \u201chave stoked inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cElsewhere (Kenya, South Africa), subdued demand has kept inflation in check,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the report, foreign direct investments in the region have been resilient, recouping about nine-tenths of their pre-pandemic levels, and workers\u2019 remittances to the region have held up better than expected.\n\n\u201cGrowth is forecast to resume to 2.8 per cent this year and firm to 3.3 per cent in 2022, underpinned by stronger external demand, mainly from China and the United States, higher commodity prices, and containment of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cProcurement and logistical challenges are expected to continue hobble the pace of vaccination despite the provision of vaccines by COVAX. Policy uncertainty and the lingering effects of the pandemic are expected to delay major investments in infrastructure and extractives and to weigh on the recovery (Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Niger, Kenya).\n\n\u201cPer capita income levels in 2022 are expected to be four per cent lower on average than in 2019. Conditions in the region\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected countries are expected to be particularly challenging; their average output level in 2022 is forecast to be 5.3 per cent below its size in 2019,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stated that while some countries (Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa) are presently upgrading national vaccine distribution systems, procurement and logistical hurdles in many other countries could slow vaccinations.\n\nIt, however, warned that an oil price drop could dent revenues for some oil exporters.\n\n\u201cFood insecurity remains a key risk as food prices have risen by more than 20 percent early this year in Angola, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Flood and drought could also destroy crops, exacerbate food price inflation, and further weigh on household consumption.\n\n\u201cRising conflicts could weaken recoveries. A sudden rise in sovereign borrowing costs could instigate financial pressures in some countries and high debt burdens and fiscal pressures could become more acute.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the pace of vaccinations could surpass expectations, restoring consumer and business confidence and strengthening the recovery. A stronger-than-expected rally in metal and oil prices could boost revenues,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe global economy was expected to expand by 5.6 per cent in 2021, the fastest post-recession pace in 80 years, largely on strong rebounds from a few major economies.\n\nThe projected expansion would make 2021 the fastest year of growth since 1973\u2019s 6.6 per cent.\n\nHowever, many emerging market and developing economies continue to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, the World Bank said.\n\nAccording to the 189-country anti-poverty agency, the world economy, which shrank 3.5 per cent last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade, forced businesses to close and people to stay at home, will grow 5.6 per cent this year, up from the 4.1 per cent it forecast in January.\n\nBut the World Bank noted that despite the recovery, global output will be about 2 per cent below pre-pandemic projections by the end of this year.\n\nPer capita income losses will also not be unwound by 2022 for about two-thirds of emerging market and developing economies.\n\nAmong low-income economies, where vaccination has lagged, the effects of the pandemic have reversed poverty reduction gains and aggravated insecurity and other long-standing challenges.\n\nCommenting on the report, World Bank Group President, Mr. David Malpass, said: \u201cWhile there are welcome signs of global recovery, the pandemic continues to inflict poverty and inequality on people in developing countries around the world.\n\n\u201cGlobally coordinated efforts are essential to accelerate vaccine distribution and debt relief, particularly for low-income countries. As the health crisis eases, policymakers will need to address the pandemic\u2019s lasting effects and take steps to spur green, resilient, and inclusive growth while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NBC to license OTT\n\n\u2022House probes legality of stoppage, summons information minister\n\n\u2022Despite ordering violators\u2019 prosecution, Malami accesses Twitter, deactivates account\n\n\u2022Trump lauds Nigeria over Twitter\u2019s suspension\n\nEzeobi Chiemelie in Lagos, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe suspension of the operation of American microblogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria by the federal government is to remain indefinitely until the company shows remorse, a top federal government official told THISDAY yesterday.\n\nAccording to him, since the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria last Friday, the company has not reached out to the federal government for dialogue.\n\nHowever, the House of Representatives has waded into the dispute as it mandated its Committees on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence to investigate the circumstances leading to the suspension of operations of Twitter in Nigeria and the legality of the action.\n\nIt also summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to shed light on the matter.\n\nBut despite the suspension and the order by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), to prosecute violators of the suspension directive, many prominent Nigerians and some organisations have remained active on the microblogging site.\n\nNotwithstanding his order, Malami yesterday logged on to Twitter, using Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass the blockade by telecoms companies that have blocked access to the site, to deactivate his account.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that contrary to the impression given to the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth-Leonard, that Twitter was already holding talks with the federal government, the source said no discussion was going on.\n\nBeth-Leonard had led heads of the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland missions to a meeting with the Minister Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, on Monday in Abuja, where she said she was glad to learn that Twitter was negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the source said: \u201cAs we speak, there has been no communication between Twitter and the federal government, and until the company does the needful, its operations will remain suspended indefinitely.\u201d\n\nThe source said the federal government suspended Twitter because it had persistently made its platform available for the propagation of activities of persons who want to destabilise the country.\n\nHe said when the federal government complained, Twitter said the propagandists had not violated its rules.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the federal government approached Twitter to remove a tweet by Nnamdi Kanu but the company responded that the material did not offend its rules,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that even after that, Kanu used Twitter to ask his followers to kill Nigerian soldiers and police personnel and they obeyed.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf that is not offensive, what is?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, over the top (OTT) companies operate in Nigeria without registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and paying tax on the billions they make in the country.\n\nThis, he said, would no longer happen as henceforth, the OTTs would now have to register as Nigerian companies and would be expected to comply with the terms of their registration with the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).\n\n\u201cAnyone of them that is not registered would not be allowed to operate. Anyone that abuses the terms of its registration would have its licence withdrawn,\u201d he added.\n\nHouse Investigates Legality of Suspension, Summons Information Minister\n\nThe House of Representatives has mandated its various committees to probe the circumstances of the decision by the federal government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and the legality of the suspension.\n\nThe House also summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to appear before it and explain the reasons for the action.\n\nThe directives were contained in an address delivered by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, at the resumption of plenary yesterday.\n\nGbajabiamila said the lawmakers were aware that the suspension of Twitter had generated a fierce debate, adding that the House has since the announcement been inundated with comments about the decision, requests for intervention and criticism.\n\nHe stated that the House recognised that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria, particularly among the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation.\n\nHe, however, said the House also recognised that as social media has been a tool for good, it could also be a tool for bad actors, hence the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that these platforms are not used to commit vile actions against individuals and the state.\n\nAccording to him, it\u2019s the proper role of the legislature in circumstances like this to unravel the issues until they develop an understanding of the why and the how of executive decisions.\n\nGbajabiamila added that the legislature must ensure that regulatory and enforcement actions by the government are in accordance with the laws, due process followed and the outcomes of regulatory decisions do not result in adverse consequences for the country and its people.\n\nHe gave the committees 10 days to conclude the assignment and report back to the House for further legislative action.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe listen to the agitation of the people, but we also hear from the government so that from the abundance of information, we reach the level of awareness that allows us to discharge our role dispassionately. It is in service of our obligations under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and our moral duty to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe speaker also decried the spate of killings across the country.\n\nHe said the attacks called for coordinated and targeted action by government at all levels to address the menace and save the nation.\n\nPDP House Members Stage Walkout at Plenary\n\nHowever, a mild drama ensued yesterday when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House staged a walkout at the plenary after Gbajabiamila ruled out of order, their prayer calling on the federal government to reverse the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, in his address, had apparently preempted the opposition lawmakers when he mandated the various committees to probe the circumstances of the decision by the federal government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nBut the leader of the PDP caucus, Hon. Kingsely Chinda, raised a point of order, citing section 39 of the constitution, section 19 of the Universal Declaration on Human and Peoples Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights and commended the steps taken so far by the speaker.\n\nHe added that while he agreed with the submission of the leadership of the House, the House should urge the executive arm to reverse the suspension, while the committees continue their assignment within the stipulated 10 days.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile I agree with the submission of the leadership of this House completely, I will only want to add that for the breach of our fundamental human rights, particularly the right to fair hearing, right to freedom of speech and expression, we should urge the executive arm in the interim to reverse the ban pending our interaction with the executive.\u201d\n\nBut the speaker ruled him out of order, saying that since the matter has been referred to committees already, it was wrong for it to be revived again.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me quickly refer you to Order 9, Rule 1 Sub Rule 6 of our rules, which states that it shall be out of order to reconsider any specific question upon which the House has come to a conclusion during the current session except upon a substantive motion for rescission.\n\n\u201cThis matter has already been sent to the committees to look at the issues you are talking about and will report to us within 10 days. Even if you had brought a motion here, it would have been referred to a committee. We are not even sure if your motion would not have been killed. This day, we have saved the day. So you are ruled out of order.\u201d\n\nChinda, however, insisted on being heard, but the House Leader, Hon. Alhassan Doguwa, and Chief Whip, Hon. Mohammed Tahir Mongunu, asked him to be guided.\n\nIt was at this point that a visibly angry Chinda and some other members of the caucus walked out of the plenary.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers later addressed the press on their grievances, saying that the members would continue to tweet in disregard of the suspension and are ready to be jailed.\n\nHowever, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi, later raised a point of order, alleging that there was an earlier plan by some members to disrupt the business of the House if their demands were not granted.\n\nSuspension Unprofessional, Ill-advised, Says Catholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) has described the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria as ill-advised.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by the Secretary of CSN, Rev. Fr. Mike Umoh, the church said the action was condemnable.\n\n\u201cWhile the Catholic Church is not against regulations of media use, she abhors when such action is selective or used as tool for suppressing the people.\n\n\u201cThis is one decision that will further paint this government in darker pigments as anti-people and anti-democratic,\u201d he said.\n\nUmoh stated that as a mark of the futility of such actions, even some people in the government are reported to have still used the facility after the suspension, while many Nigerians resorted to the use of VPN and remote proxy options.\n\nDespite Ordering Violators\u2019 Prosecution, Malami Accesses Twitter, Deactivates Account\n\nMeanwhile, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice , Mr. Abubakar Malami, yesterday deactivated his account.\n\nMalami posted the screenshot of his deactivated account, which showed a VPN symbol, on his Facebook page.\n\nHe, however, did not state how he was able to access his Twitter account since all telecommunication companies had blocked access to Twitter through their networks, forcing Nigerians to download VPN.\n\nHis Facebook post attracted varied reactions from his followers, with,l some Nigerians, mostly supporters of the government, praising him for compliance with the directive.\n\nBut another follower, Masta Pee, who wrote: \u201cHow did he deactivated his account without logging in to Twitter?\u201d\n\nHe was followed by Roy Ekwueme who wrote: \u201cThis is an evidence that you logged in Twitter today via VPN to deactivate your account, which is punishable under your unlawful law.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how you will prosecute others without throwing yourself in jail.\u201d\n\nAkintunde Babatunde said: \u201cHow are you able to deactivate Twitter without VPN? You should be arrested.\u201d\n\nTrump Lauds Nigeria over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has praised Nigeria for banning \u201cevil\u201d Twitter and encouraged other countries to do the same in the name of \u201cfree and open speech.\u201d\n\nA report on the website of DAILY BEAST, a news publication based in the United States, yesterday quoted\n\nTrump, who himself was banned by the platform for incendiary rhetoric, as saying in a statement that \u201cmore countries should ban Twitter and Facebook for not allowing free and open speech\u2014all voices should be heard. Who are they to dictate good when they themselves are evil?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I should have done it while I was president,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump also appeared to confuse Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. \u201cZuckerberg kept calling me and coming to the White House for dinner telling me how great I was. 2024?\u201d he wrote. The praise comes after it was announced earlier this month that Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram would remain banned until early 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The management of Kaduna State University (KASU) has dismissed claims in some quarters that it shut down the institution\u2019s gates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NAN, some students of the institution staged a protest on Monday over the alleged shutting down of the gates leading to the varsity.\n\nNAN reported that earlier in the day, all gates into the university were shut with only staff and medical students were allowed entrance.\n\nIt added that some of the students had come to submit their final projects while others were in the school to defend their final year projects, but were all denied access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development had led to the barricade of the Tafawa Balewa Way by the students before they were later dispersed by heavily armed policemen, led by Samuel Ibrahim, an assistant superintendent.\n\nThe students were, however, said to have reconvened at the back gate through Marafa Estate and continued their protest by barricading all access roads leading to the university\u2019s main entrance.\n\nKhalil Adam, welfare director of the national association of arts students, said there was no official communication from the school management to explain why they were denied access to the university.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe heard a rumour yesterday that the school has been shut down only for us to come to the institute this morning to find the gates closed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe security officers at the gate told us that they were asked to close the gate, and that only staff will be granted access.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a final-year student of pharmaceutical science said she had come to defend her final project but was denied access to the school.\n\n\u201cWe came to school this morning to defend our final project only to find the school gate shut and all efforts to convince the security official to grant us access failed. As it stands now, we don\u2019t know our fate,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in his reaction in a statement, Adamu Bargo, the varsity\u2019s public relations officer, said it was not true that the institution shut down its gates.\n\n\u201cThe Management of Kaduna State University wishes to inform staff, students and the general public to ignore the news being spread in the social media space regarding shutting down of the university,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cIt is fake news in its entirety as well as the handiwork of mischief-makers, academic activities are in progress.\n\n\u201cManagement urges everyone to carry on with their legitimate activities as it is partnering with security agencies in the state to ensure the safety of all and sundry.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his part, Abubakar Abdullahi, a member of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the institution, said that it was within the rights of the students to protest the increase in fees.\n\nThe varsity has been in the news since the state government increased the tuition fees of students from the range of N24,000 and N26,000 to N150,000 in April.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution to investigate the legality of the suspension of Twitter in the country. Announced on Friday, the controversial decision has stoked national conversations and attracted international criticism over the last few days.\n\nThe investigation by lawmakers represents the first major move by the legislative body on the suspension of Twitter and comes after widespread criticism from Nigerians over the silence and inaction of the National Assembly since the ban was imposed.\n\nMembers of the lower chamber have been \u201cinundated with comments about the decision (suspending Twitter), requests for intervention and criticism\u201d since the announcement, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said during the resumption of the plenary session of the House in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the House recognises that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria \u201cparticularly amongst the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation with great success.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker however cautioned that although the social media platform is a very important means of communication and business for the younger generation of Nigerians, the government has a responsibility to ensure it is not used to undermine national security even as lawmakers must see to it that government policies are in line with the law and without adverse consequences on the people.\n\nAs part of the investigation that will be carried out by the House Committees on Communication, Justice, Information & Culture, and National Security & Intelligence, the Minister of Culture & Information, Lai Mohammed, has been invited to brief the House on the objectives, intent, and duration of the suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe committees are expected to question Lai Mohammed and report to the House within 10 days to guide further action by the lawmakers on the matter, Gbajabiamila said.\n\nThe embattled minister who announced the suspension of Twitter, cited a \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d as reason for the ban. The U.S. social media giant has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the ban.\n\nNigerians continue to use Twitter, however, thanks to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that have helped bypass the ban. In response, the Nigerian Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has ordered the immediate prosecution of people still making use of the microblogging platform. The country\u2019s broadcast regulator has also ordered television and radio stations to suspend their use of Twitter.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. Wuri Ventures and Capria Ventures also participated investing $1.5m. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "text": "HELPING AFRICAN CONSUMERS SEND AND RECEIVE AS LITTLE AS $1 USING CRYPTO\n\n\u2013 FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD \u2013\n\nEasyShare; a fast, reliable, and super affordable way to send and receive money to anyone in Africa using crypto has officially launched in beta mode in Africa.\n\nBy using innovative low-cost crypto-technology to drastically cut transaction fees, Easyshare will also allow consumers to perform micro-transactions safely, securely and affordably.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of the beta platform, Ben Onuoha Co-founder and Head of Partnerships & Community at EasyShare.Africa said, \u201cEasyshare was born out of a lot of research. Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes. EasyShare.Africa improves on this crypto peer-to-peer remittance model by adding a decentralized layer where verified remittance agents can stake SHARE Token \u2013 the native crypto of the Easyshare ecosystem \u2013 as collateral/insurance to guarantee the agents complete transactions.\n\nThe Easyshare model is poised to contribute to eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making a case for the unbanked and underbanked through offering various services such as micro remittances, microfinance loans, savings, insurance, payments, e-commerce and more for low-income populations in Africa and other emerging markets.

          "text": "Digital transformation has reinforced the importance of investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset monitoring, data collection, and decision making, to maximize value from operational assets in advanced and emerging economies.\n\nLagos, Nigeria: Today, PlugnPlay IoT, a subsidiary of NovaTrack Limited announced that it will be organizing a private Asset Tracking seminar in Lagos, Nigeria that will discuss the importance, necessity, and the \u2018how\u2019 of adopting the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for business advancement, especially in emerging economies through digital transformation focused on asset management and tracking.\n\nThe seminar, as part of the PlugnPlay IoT measures to help businesses in emerging economies scale by revealing how businesses, regardless of size can reduce operational cost in the areas of asset maintenance, security, data collection, etc., will be held this year, precisely on the 15 June 2021.\n\nAs rightly stated by PlugnPlay IoT, \u201cthe recent security challenges in major African economies, especially Nigeria highlight the need for increased security protocols for valuables. In the case of businesses, these valuables are referred to as company assets. These are infrastructure, equipment, or personnel that have some reasonable and clear lifetime value pegged on them. Aside from security, businesses that wish to stand strong through time naturally seek to improve operational processes, especially with technology and innovation that provides an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, some business assets may not deliver direct value but will have other processes or operations dependent on their indirect value. Such business assets are often mistaken for less important but they should be secured to avoid or reduce unwanted events like operational downtimes which may lead to loss of trust and reduced work efficiency all of which runs down any business.\u201d\n\nThese challenges are common to all; Oil & Gas, Construction, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Logistics, Energy Supply and Distribution, Facility Management, etc., and there is always a place for IoT to satisfy these. Industries like these have been seen to speedily displace entities that fail to evolve with technological advantages because advancements such as IoT drastically improves operational success and reduces risk while increasing customer satisfaction. For example, the advent of GPS tracking revolutionized the logistics sector, and those able to perfectly fit it into business processes now lead the industry. This is why PlugnPlay IoT has put together the Asset Tracking 101 Seminar to present industry leaders who participate with the unfair advantage of business asset tracking with IoT technology.\n\nA representative of PlugnPlay IoT also mentioned that \u201cthe seminar, to be held on June 15, will privately engage high-level participants from both the public and private sector; CEOs, CTOs, CIOs, Senior Managers, Government Heads, and will focus on the key issues surrounding business innovation and the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset tracking to increase profitability and boost economic prosperity.\u201d The program will include training and updates on new products/solutions with speeches delivered by highly ranked business leaders in Nigeria and as a private event, it is strictly on invitation. However, business leaders who consider themselves qualified to participate can request to attend on their webpage.\n\nAbout PlugnPlay IoTPlugnPlayIoT is an IoT service provider, powered by NovaTrack Ltd, that empowers system integrators, technology experts, software developers and entrepreneurs to build and scale their own IoT business verticals at a relatively low cost. Our solutions enable our channel partners to deploy wireless connected sensors with remote monitoring capability, data analytics and real-time alerts for various industry applications.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nUberX Hourly launches in Nigeria\n\nMoneyHash pre-seed investment round\n\nUpdates on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\n\nUber Launches UberX Hourly in Nigeria\n\nOn Monday, June 7, 2021, US-based ride-hailing platform, Uber, announced the official launch of UberX Hourly in Nigeria.\n\nWith this new feature, riders can stop at multiple locations to carry out activities without requesting several rides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that you can book a ride to an event centre but also stop by the pharmacy to get drugs or the supermarket to grab a few things with the same ride. Of course, you can\u2019t do all that with the initial amount paid.\n\nHow it works is, on the Uber app, you can order a ride as usual, but this time, you\u2019d select an Hourly Driver. Then, put in your destination and send your driver an in-app message to discuss how much time you think you might spend on all trips. Upfront charges are based on the minimum per hour, and consequently, per minutes.\n\nThis launch follows a warning strike action carried out by Bolt and Uber riders under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA) in April and a 13% increase in fares in Lagos in May.\n\nBefore now, UberX Hourly was only available in Africa in Tanzania\u2019s largest city, Dar Es Salaam. According to Uber\u2019s Country Manager for Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, the warm reception of the product by both riders and users in that city reflects its viability and scalability in Nigeria. .\n\nEven if there is some excitement about the feature in the country, the drivers\u2019 concerns haven\u2019t been addressed. Time will tell how affordable UberX Hourly will be.\n\nMoneyHash raises undisclosed pre-seed round\n\nL-R MoneyHash co-founders Nader Abdelrazik, Anisha Sekar and Mustafa Eid. Source:The Capital Quest\n\nEgypt-based fintech startup, MoneyHash, raised an undisclosed pre-seed investment on Monday, June 7,2021. The round was led by COTU ventures, a leading seed-stage venture firm in the Middle East.\n\nOther investors in the round include Kepple Africa Ventures, Nigeria-based early-stage VC, Ventures Platform, and some angel investors.\n\nThe startup is currently building an API to help businesses access all payments and fintech services across the Middle East region. This will help eCommerce merchants provide users with a seamless experience during checkout and create a compact user database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Nader Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash launched in December 2020. The app is currently running a private beta mode. The funding will be put towards a public launch, product development, and team growth.\n\nIt goes to say that more startups realise the necessity of fintech platforms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This should be no surprise as it\u2019s a region where only 40% of the population have access to bank accounts. The fintech and digital banking scene is plagued with issues like lack of a unified data system and payment integration; startups like MoneyHash are looking to provide viable solutions to these problems.\n\nStill on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\u2026\n\nA lot seems to have happened since the Federal Government of Nigeria banned the use of microblogging platform, Twitter, on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThe news was received with a bitter counteraction by a large number of the public, as it poses a threat to the core values of free speech and freedom of expression that are the bedrock of a democratic state.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to react to a wrong, and it is another to be aware of the facts as to why an action may be wrong or right.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo picked the brains of three lawyers to find out the legality of the directive. What\u2019s your guess?\n\nYou should check it out: #TwitterBan: Exploring the legal intricacies of Nigeria\u2019s decision\n\nThat\u2019s not all. In a bid to access Twitter, Nigerians currently have to resort to using Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Questions like \u201cShould all VPNs be trusted?\u201d have been asked.\n\nYou can find answers here: #TwitterBan: Should Nigerians be worried about VPNs?\n\nRemember, safety first!\n\nAnd in a latest development, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has given orders to broadcasting stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and desist from reporting to their audience via that platform.\n\nRead more: #TwitterBan: Nigerian TV, radio stations, others can no longer tweet or patronise Twitter\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government is reportedly drafting new rules that will mandate foreign companies like Twitter to get a licence before they can operate in the country.\n\nSmoke without fire? This Bloomberg article has it that the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, through his special assistant on Media, has denied that the government is planning to partner with China to build an Internet firewall. He calls it \u201ca figment of the reporter\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nWhile this gives some sort of relief, it\u2019s still clear that freedom of speech is under threat.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading:\n\nFaceTime is coming to Android and Windows via the web.

          "text": "China has announced a series of measures for high-quality development of public hospitals in the next five years, including providing medical resources to underdeveloped areas and improving public health emergency policies.\n\nDrawing lessons from the COVID-19 epidemic, the government has vowed to oversee the high-quality development of its 12,000 public hospitals over the next five years.\n\nThis offers a clue for Nigeria in easing the pressure often placed on big public hospitals in city centres by large population of those who rely on government facilities to offset treatment cost.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has been advising people to seek treatment in nearby medical centres, instead of going to big hospitals in big cities.\n\nSince 2019, top public hospitals in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have been encouraged to set up sub-branches in provinces that have a large population, but don\u2019t have advanced medical resources. And authorities say the plan has been working. The 10 pilot projects have helped patients get treatment in local hospitals.\n\nRead Also: Healthcare delivery suffers in Ondo as 105 medical doctors resign\n\n\u201cIn Henan, there\u2019s a sub-branch of Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital in the provincial capital Zhengzhou. In 2020, the province saw a big drop in the number of patients who went to the Children\u2019s Hospital in Beijing. The number of out-patients has dropped by 63 percent, and the number of hospitalized patients has dropped by 51 percent,\u201d said Sun Zhicheng, director of Social Development Department of the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nThese sub-branches are called regional medical centres and will be expanded to all provinces by the end of next year. The government also requires every city to choose one comprehensive hospital to focus on the epidemic.\n\nHospitals specialising in infectious diseases will also receive support to improve their facilities. These are just part of the new blueprint.\n\nLi Bin, vice-minister of the National Health Commission, explained what the government aims to achieve in the next five years.\n\n\u201cPublic hospitals will focus on improving quality and efficiency rather than expanding in scale. Their operation and management will be more delicate and will focus on talents and technologies, instead of materials and equipment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll these measures aim to provide efficient medical services with high quality, and to prevent and fight major epidemics and public health emergencies. They\u2019ll support the construction of a healthy China,\u201d Li added.\n\nThe central government is requiring public hospitals to be better prepared for major epidemics.\n\nOne of the issues of concern to public health systems in Nigeria is that people often bypass secondary healthcare facilities to move cases directly to tertiary hospitals believed to be better equipped and managed experienced health experts.\n\nAlthough many secondary healthcare facilities run the Lagos state government for instance has at least a surgeon, obstetrician, gynaecologist, paediatrician and specialist equipment, resident still both in city centres and suburbs still overlook them due to delays in access and sometimes unavailable of the experts.\n\n\u201cPeople will not go to any of those secondary hospitals. They prefer to come to LASUTH. So, we are overs-subscribed. As we speak, we have over 37 medical emergency beds,\u201d Adetokunbo Fabamwo, chief medical director, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) told BusinessDay earlier in an interview.",

His death is not only a loss to the family and the church, but to Nigeria and the world at large.\u201d\n\nThe letter commiserating with Mr Joshua\u2019s family, dated June 6, was shared by the CAN\u2019s spokesperson, Bright Oladeji, on his Facebook account on June 8.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES could not ascertain the reason for this gap at the time of filing this report nor did Mr Oladeji answer his call in respect to the lacuna.\n\nThe Christian body, in the letter, encouraged the family and the church to take solace in the will of God and pray for eternal rest for the deceased.\n\n\u201cThere are indeed no exact words of comfort at a moment like this, but we humbly enjoin you to take solace in the Will of the Almighty God, who works in us both to do and work according to his good purpose (Philippians 2:13). We know that Our Lord Jesus Christ in whom there is all sufficiency, and whom you have been serving wholeheartedly will make all grace abound unto you at this trying moment (2 Corinthians 9:8).\n\n\u201cOn behalf of all members of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), we commiserate with you, and the entire family on this loss. It is our prayer that the Almighty God grant Prophet T.B Joshua an eternal rest in his creator, and may God\u2019s perpetual light continue to shine on his path (Amen),\u201d Mr Ayokunle said in the letter addressed to the SCOAN.\n\nIt is not clear if Mr Joshua\u2019s ministry was a member of CAN.",

          "text": "Tom Okpe, Abuja\n\nA major contender in the forrhcoming Anambra State governorship election under the All Progressives Congress,(APC), Senator Andy Uba said the state is in a cross-road and has the plan to change and uplift it to its glory.\n\nUba told journalists at the party Secretariat on Tuesday when he came to submit his nomination and expression of interest forms to contest the November, 6th Governorship election that he once won the state governorship election, with the plans to change the state gor better.\n\n\u201cIf you remember, in 2007 when I won the election as the governor of Anambra state, I had the plan to change the face of Anambra.\n\n\u201cMy plan was to lift the youths, to help, empower them, women and be able to take Anambra to a different level. Infrastructures, agriculture and so many other plans. I have modified those plans now from what they were before. Anambra will be a different state once I am elected as the governor,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue of concensus candidate, the Senator said: \u201cI dont think that has been presented to us. I have no idea what you are saying. Nobody told me about concensus. I have not heard it. This is the first time I am hearing it from you.\n\nAbout other contestants like the former CBN Governor Charles Soludo and how he will be able to scuffle through with the incumbent Governor, Willy Obiano, he said; \u201cWell, for you mentioning Soludo, I think Anambra people will have to decide after our primary and I know i am going to win for sure.\n\n\u201cAfter the primary they will decide who they want as their governor. What APGA has done they have done. Everybody knows.They have been there for 16 years and that doesn\u2019t mean; if you remember, we had a party that was there for many years.\n\n\u201cAPC still came in. So many years doesn\u2019t mean anything. That you are there for twenty or thirty years. What have you done? Are the people happy with you? If they are not then you have reasons to change, I am sure there will be change to vote APC this time, he stated.\n\nOn his part, Rev Godwin Okonkwo, another contestant while submitting his forms said he is in the contest, fully prepared with sound mind, capacity, courage and character.\n\nHe noted that competence without character has no value; \u201cThey both enrich values. And I think I have that.\n\n\u201cI am bringing unity to my people. I will be a father to everyone. And Anambra with me there, hope of the poor will be restored. We will restore Anambra to a place that investors will have confidence and a place to invest in.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of zoning, Rev Okonkwo who emphasised on fairness said: \u201cI believe in fairness, equity, justice, and good conscience.\n\n\u201cIf the North had gone, equity demands that it comes to the south. If it doesn\u2019t go to the south, it means it has to wait for another 24 years before it comes to it. How old will I be by then? So it should go to South because I believe in natural justice and fairness.\u201d\n\nOn the Church participation in npolitics, the aspirant stressed that it\u2019s unfortunate what \u201cI met on ground when I joined the APC.\n\n\u201cIt shows the church still have a long way to go in impacting love in the hearts of people. When our hears are transformed, our love will not know colour. It will know no boundaries. I am an Anglican priest. When the sun shines, does it select where to shine on? Of course no.\n\n\u201cHe who hates his sister or brother is a murderer. The bible say that and I believe very much in it. I cannot go against what I preach. I will be father to all. I will respect our elders. I will honor our fathers in the lord and traditional rulers. But, I will obey God. And I know God is a just God.\n\n\u201cI will fear Him, because his love doesn\u2019t demarcate. That is who I am and what i will bring to the table.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the mode of primary election, he wants the party to choose a model that will make people in Anambra come into the APC.\n\nThe trained chartered accountant, Reverened Priest of the Angican Communion turned politican, worked in NNPC upto the level of Managing Director noted that he offered himself to serve his people, Anambra State, adding that he will not join people who publishes what they do to help others.",

          "text": "By PHILIP CLEMENT\n\nThe Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has called on the federal government to consider the economic implications of the recent suspension of twitter usage in Nigeria as many business rely on the social media platform to sell and trade their products.\n\nIn a statement, the NESG said:\u201dFor many of these businesses, social media platforms have become a veritable tool for engaging existing and potential clients over the years. As a result, platforms like Twitter which has about 17 million active users in Nigeria, have become a community for businesses and clients to exchange ideas, share progress, and address complaints towards optimal service delivery.\n\n\u201cLikewise, the digital marketing and e-commerce space has unveiled new markets for many Nigerian companies, particularly among the youth, many of whom have an active online presence. The contribution of these companies to job creation, value addition and the economy has been salutary.\n\n\u201cDespite the inflow of investment into the digital economy, overall Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow into Nigeria is yet to achieve its true potential. In the last five years, FDI inflows into Nigeria has remained around US$1billion, according to data from the NBS.\n\n\u201cThis amount is meagre compared with the inflows of countries such as Egypt, South Africa, and Indonesia. At a difficult time like this, when Nigeria must grow its economy, plug into the global digital revolution, attract patient international capital and sustained foreign currency inflow to address our foreign exchange challenges, the temporary suspension of Twitter in Nigeria sends out a wrong signal and will stand in the way of our path to rapid economic recovery,\u201d the NESG added.\n\nIt urged the Federal Government to reconsider the twitter ban decision and rescind the suspension to foster inclusive development, global competitiveness, and much faster economic growth in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further, the group has advised government at all levels and the private sector to explore all means of embracing and supporting the digital economy as it remains a veritable tool to national development.\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria slipped into its second recession in five years, with a GDP contraction of 3.6% in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nUnemployment rate rose to 33.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, about 8.6 million Nigerians were estimated to have fallen into poverty in 2020, and about 13 million children were out of school.\n\nDespite its negative impact, COVID-19 has accelerated the embrace of digital technologies in our everyday lives.\n\n\u201cAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (despite the contraction of our economy), ICT and Finance emerged as two of the few growth sectors in 2020 and were the fastest-growing, with growth rates of 12.9% and 9.4%, respectively. This means that the digital sector remains crucial in accelerating Nigeria\u2019s recovery from the devastating impacts of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, Nigerian startups have raised approximately US$498 million, according to Techpoint Africa.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in the FINTECH industry, Nigeria remains one of the most attractive markets in the African continent, attracting US$122 million in 2019, representing 24.8% of total investment in the continent, according to the 2019 African Tech Startups Funding Report. The industry has seen the entrants of companies and the rise of digital entrepreneurs who have continuously created value for brands, clients and other stakeholders,\u201d the statement added.",

He said partnership by all stakeholders would help to sustain and improve the agricultural sector and help the country become more successful.\n\nIn her closing remarks, Head, Public Policy Reforms and Intelligence of the NESG, Ms. Seun Ojo, thanked everyone for attending the event and for engaging in robust discussions that will lead to addressing food loss and waste.\n\nShe stated that the dialogue was an important step in improving Nigeria\u2019s food systems through the provision of pragmatic solutions and that a framework will be created that will fit into the larger UN resolutions, which will help in achieving the objective of shaping an improved food system.\n\n\u201cThe best way to deal with food insecurity, malnutrition and hunger is collective and concerted collaboration and effort between government, private sector, civil society organisations and all stakeholders\u201d, She concluded.",

          "text": "The easiest way for falsehood to triumph is to let it run amok unchallenged.\n\nDr. Folarin Gbadebo Smith\u2019s first term as Director General of the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER), one of Nigeria\u2019s pre-eminent research institutions was dogged by a slew of unfounded accusations, baseless charges of financial recklessness and sundry falsehood orchestrated by amorphous entities masquerading as interested parties.\n\nHis major traducers remain the \u201cAcademic Staff Union of Research Institutes headed by Babatimeyin Muyiwa; Senior Staff Association of Universities, Teaching Hospitals, Research Institutes and Associated Institutions headed by Matthew Olagunju, and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions headed by Tubi O. Theophilus\u201d as reported by an online publication.\n\nThe most egregious accusation as published by the same online medium playing advocate for the traducers is that Dr. FolarinGbadebo-Smith had squandered\u201calmost N1.5 billion in combined annual budgetary releases without commensurate projects to justify such spending in his four years as head of the institute.\u201d\n\nThis charge is laughable and puerile because a quick check of budgetary allocations will establish that NISER\u2019s budget for the four years was a little under N850m. So, how could the Director General have squandered money that was not allocated?\n\nIn a dramatic escalation of their protests and allegations the Unions on Monday June 7, 2020 took their issues to Abuja. They printed banners, rented a van and drove round the town in what was a crude attempt to get the attention of government.\n\nAlongside this, an obviously rented crowd purporting to be members of the institute (only one person in the crowd could be positively identified as NISER staff) confronted the Minister of Finance under whose ministry NISER functions. Honourable Minister Zainab Ahmed in her usual calm and distinguished manner granted audience and assured them that their issues would be looked into and that in the interim peace and order should be maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ibadan where the NISER is located, the gates remain locked preventing over 200 staff members from accessing their offices and carrying out their statutory obligations despite it being an offence in law and against the labour laws for a union to deny workers access to a federal government premises. This action by the unions is clearly a cheap attempt to draw the DG into a violent confrontation on the premises of the institute.\n\nNISER which began life as a center in the University of Ibadan,was made autonomous by the Federal Government in 1977 and so became a full-fledged research institute distinct from the University of Ibadan. The autonomy was granted via NISER Act No. 70 of 1977 (now Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2006 CAP 115). NISER moved out of the University of Ibadan to its headquarters at Ojoo, Ibadan in 1987.\n\nNISER\u2019s mandate was clear from inception; to employ the best and the brightest minds from the academia who would be fully equipped to serve as a think-tank in the field of social and economic development for the country.\n\nUpon assumption of office, Dr. Folarin Gbadebo-Smith focused fully on making NISER a world class research institute in which scholars would have a sense of pride and an institute which grant making institutions would be happy to support.\n\nEducated, affable, well-travelled and globally exposed, Dr. Gbadebo Smith was keenly aware that nothing makes a good impression as the first impression. So he went about improving the facilities at NISER to provide an environment and facility conducive for conducting research. This was critical because a grant making body had visited NISER and seeing the state of their rest rooms and facilities backed out from supporting NISER.\n\nTo facilitate research based activities especially in a 21st century research institute, Dr. Gbadebo-Smith quickly connected the institute to, what a group made up of Research Professors, Heads of Departments and members of NISER Management, called \u201cfull time, 24/7 functioning internet service within NISER premises. This has been consistent and we have never had it so good at NISER.\u201d\n\nIn a May 7, 2021 letter to NISER\u2019s supervising minister, Prince Clem Agba, Honourable Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, the group provided copious evidence to disprove the accusations leveled against the DG while providing proof of measures and actions and initiatives taken to restore NISER to its pride of place.\n\nThe letter was signed on behalf of the group by four professors and heads of four departments at NISER. The signatories include Prof F.O.N. Roberts, Head, Political & Governance Policy Dept; Prof A.O. Adesanya, Head, Env. & Physical lnfra. Policy Dept; Prof J.O.Adeoti, Head, lnnovation&Tech Policy and Prof S.O. Odekunle,Head,Human Capital Policy Dept.\n\nThe quartet, in their letter, noted without equivocation that: \u201cWe the undersigned, having served the institute for many years as Research Professors, Heads of Departments and members of NISER Management, believe that DrGbadeboSmith has done a commendable job as Director General of our lnstitute. A second term for him is in order and most desirable to improve NISER performance and prevent a return to a state of despondency and loss of the gains of almost four years of DrGbadebo-Smith\u2019s leadership at NISER.\u201d\n\nThe professors went ahead to note, in clear response to the DG\u2019s perceived lack of capacity to lead a research institute like NISER: \u201cDrFolarinGbadebo-Smith has demonstrated exceptional brilliance and high intellect in public policy discourse and in various public engagements. Though not a professor, he has distinguished himself in the understanding of development policy research and the expectations of NISER\u2019s mandate. ln our opinion, he eminently qualifies for a second term to advance and complete the good works he started.\u201d\n\nFollowing Dr. FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s return for a second term the 5th columnists have risen again with more outrageous accusations backed up by a tissue of lies. This is despite the accusations having been fully addressed in the letter signed by the four professors in which they showed, clearly, that FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s first term was one of beneficial capacity building as well as research and innovation at NISER.\n\nIn the letter the professors noted that aside the provision of high speed internet, the DG has facilitated the \u201cre-establishment of relationships with major international grant makers including MacArthur Foundation, ODI of London, Kings College University of London\u201d as well as \u201cReactivation of NISER\u2019s Knowledge Network including MOUs with Ahmadu Bello University, Federal University of Technology Mirtna, University of Cape Town, University of Delaware USA, and INEC lnstitute.\u201d\n\nAs DG, FolarinGbadebo-Smith, the professors averred, has championed capacity building with the \u201cintroduction of NISER webinar with attendance by high profile individuals in development policy research and advocacy\u201d, facilitated \u201cMerit based recruitment of 40 research staff. This has introduced new and fresh rigour into NISER research activities\u201d; enabled \u201cimplementation and regular funding of departmental research projects\u201d and the\u201crevival of Individual Research Project (IRP) programme for NISER research staff. Only very few researchers had IRP ongoing when Dr. Smith resumed as Director General in 2017. Almost all NISER research staff now engage in IRPs.\u201d\n\nWith these testimonials from eminent academics and researchers refuting the outrageous accusations leveled against a clear reform minded performer, the question becomes: who is to be believed\u2019 unionists who are clearly dancing to the tune of pecuniary interests or professors whose work and research are daily impacted by Dr, Gbadebo-Smith\u2019s progressive policies and initiatives?\n\nOnly time will tell but while we await posterity\u2019s verdict we must take a firm stand against lies and outright falsehood.\n\n***Dapo Bruce is a public analyst and writes from Lagos\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

This is despite the accusations having been fully addressed in the letter signed by the four professors in which they showed, clearly, that FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s first term was one of beneficial capacity building as well as research and innovation at NISER.\n\nIn the letter the professors noted that aside the provision of high speed internet, the DG has facilitated the \u201cre-establishment of relationships with major international grant makers including MacArthur Foundation, ODI of London, Kings College University of London\u201d as well as \u201cReactivation of NISER\u2019s Knowledge Network including MOUs with Ahmadu Bello University, Federal University of Technology Mirtna, University of Cape Town, University of Delaware USA, and INEC lnstitute.\u201d\n\nAs DG, FolarinGbadebo-Smith, the professors averred, has championed capacity building with the \u201cintroduction of NISER webinar with attendance by high profile individuals in development policy research and advocacy\u201d, facilitated \u201cMerit based recruitment of 40 research staff. This has introduced new and fresh rigour into NISER research activities\u201d; enabled \u201cimplementation and regular funding of departmental research projects\u201d and the\u201crevival of Individual Research Project (IRP) programme for NISER research staff. Only very few researchers had IRP ongoing when Dr. Smith resumed as Director General in 2017. Almost all NISER research staff now engage in IRPs.\u201d\n\nWith these testimonials from eminent academics and researchers refuting the outrageous accusations leveled against a clear reform minded performer, the question becomes: who is to be believed\u2019 unionists who are clearly dancing to the tune of pecuniary interests or professors whose work and research are daily impacted by Dr, Gbadebo-Smith\u2019s progressive policies and initiatives?\n\nOnly time will tell but while we await posterity\u2019s verdict we must take a firm stand against lies and outright falsehood.\n\n***Dapo Bruce is a public analyst and writes from Lagos\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "A 35-year-old woman, Oluwadamilare Aremu, has accused the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital of negligence leading to the amputation of her right leg.\n\nAremu told PUNCH Metro that she was admitted to LASUTH in December 2018 when an 18-passenger vehicle she boarded was involved in a crash on the Third Mainland Bridge, leading to her suffering a broken thighbone.\n\nShe alleged that doctors at LASUTH assured her that she would walk again, but her hope was dashed after two surgeries with the doctors still demanding funds for a third and final surgery, which they claimed would solve the problem.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was discharged on July 8, 2019, to go and find the money for the third surgery, adding that she was already broke as a result of the bills she had to pay while on admission.\n\nAremu stated, \u201cI was involved in an accident and rushed to LASUTH on December 16, 2018. LASUTH doctors told me that I would walk again. But after two surgeries in 2019, I was told that I needed a third and last one. They sent me home to find money, but I was broke because I had spent over N4m while on admission.\n\n\u201cThey assured me that after the third surgery, I would be able to walk again. A social media blog, Gistlover, helped me crowdfund over N1m for the last surgery. I got the money in a week and returned to the hospital for the last surgery.\u201d\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was readmitted to the Ortho \u2018A\u2019 ward of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu orthopaedic section of the hospital, adding that despite having severe pain, LASUTH allegedly kept postponing the surgery.\n\nShe also alleged that she was later moved to the Ortho \u2018B\u2019 ward under the supervision of one Dr Kayode, who was to conduct the third surgery. But no surgery was performed from 2019 till 2020.\n\nAremu said she sought alternative medical help at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, in October 2020, adding that she was advised that the leg would have to be amputated.\n\n\u201cLASUTH readmitted me and kept postponing my surgery from 2019 till October 2020 on COVID-19 excuses. I took a COVID-19 test and it was negative. I was still passing through a lot of pain. I went to Igbobi because LASUTH stopped attending to me. Igbobi told me that amputation was the only solution left because my leg had been mismanaged. But I would have to wait till 2021 because of the queue for amputation surgery. LASUTH didn\u2019t tell me the truth from the outset,\u201d Aremu lamented.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she attempted to poison herself when the pain became unbearable, adding that she opted to amputate the leg at the Oak Hospital, Ikeja.\n\nShe also alleged that one of her doctors at LASUTH was a consultant at Oak Hospital.\n\nShe stated, \u201cI opted to have the leg amputated at Oak Hospital, Ikeja. The pain was so much that I once tried to commit suicide. Oak Hospital couldn\u2019t remove the iron that LASUTH inserted in my leg, so they called a consultant to come. It was Dr Afariogun of LASUTH, who came.\n\n\u201cHe was surprised to see me. Afariogun told me that he couldn\u2019t tell me the truth, because he was afraid of his seniors at LASUTH. Dr Soga, Dr Afariogun and Dr Ajiboye were the three doctors, who attended to me at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe victim told our correspondent that she was still in pain despite the amputation of the leg and lamented that LASUTH wasted her money and rendered her immobile.\n\n\u201cEven after the amputation surgery, the damage LASUTH did to my leg could not be undone.

You can easily identify why we are experiencing developmental challenges across the board.

          "title": "Twitter ban controversy: SERAP, 176 concerned Nigerians head to ECOWAS Court",
          "text": "The controversy over the Twitter ban by the Nigerian government took another turn Tuesday as the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians filed a lawsuit against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\nThe suit, they said, was to challenge \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter, and the escalating repression of human rights, particularly the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nFollowing the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed last week announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nSimilarly, the federal government also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) directed all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nThe suit\n\nBut challenging the action in a suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP and the concerned Nigerians sought \u201can order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nFiled by SERAP solicitor, Mr Femi Falana, the plaintiffs argued that \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia,\u201d the suit read in part.\n\nThe plaintiffs therefore asked the ECOWAS Court of Justice for the following reliefs: \u201cA DECLARATION that the action of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and micro-blogging application without an order of a competent court of jurisdiction is unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendant in mandating its agent to commence and continue to regulate the social media in Nigeria amounts to restriction and censorship, thus violating Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and micro-blogging application in Nigeria without any offence known to law is incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations, and are therefore null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the directive by the Defendant, through the National Broadcasting Commission, directing and \u2018advising\u2019 broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and discontinue its use is a breach of the citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression, access to information as well as media freedom, and therefore, null and void.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendant to frequently threaten Nigerians and other people who use Twitter and/or other social micro-blogging applications in Nigeria with criminal prosecution and the actual act of suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, violates the principle that there is no punishment without law, and the right to fair hearing, and therefore, null and void.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER setting aside the suspension, ban, sanction or other punishments whatsoever imposed on Twitter, Nigerians, media houses, broadcast stations and any social media service providers by the Defendant and its agents.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER directing the Defendant and its agents to immediately revoke, withdraw and/or rescind their suspension or ban of Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s) in Nigeria in line with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Revised ECOWAS Treaty 1993.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER OF PERPETUAL INJUNCTION restraining the Defendant and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions and other punishment including criminal prosecution or doing anything whatsoever to harass Twitter, broadcast stations, Nigerians and other people and any social media service provider(s), and media houses who are Twitter users.\n\n\u201cSUCH FURTHER orders the Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this suit.\u201d\n\nReps investigate\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives has said it would, within 10 days, investigate the reasons behind decisions by the federal government to ban Twitter.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila stated this in his opening address at the plenary Tuesday, noted that the micro-blogging platform had become a huge communication tool and platform for enterprise especially for the teeming youth in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila also said the lawmakers were inundated with protests and demands for intervention by the parliament.\n\nHe, however, noted that the House also needed to hear from the government, especially the information and culture minister who issued the directive suspending the social media app in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, therefore, mandated the relevant committees of the House to invite Mohammed to explain the decision by the government and the reasons and basis for it.\n\nThe committees, which he ordered to start work immediately, is expected to report back within 10 days.\n\nMalami holds the ace \u2013 Mohammed\n\nAnd even at that, the information minister has said Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, SAN, will decide whether or not to prosecute the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye; Founder and General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry Worldwide, Pastor William Kumuyi; as well as other violators of the Twitter ban by the federal government.\n\nMohammed said this Monday evening during an interview with BBC News Africa.\n\nAdeboye, in a tweet Monday, had said his church is present in over 170 countries and tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nAlso, hours later, Kumuyi also tweeted that his church had branches across over 100 countries and five continents hence it can tweet from anywhere in the world.\n\nAsked specifically whether the government would prosecute Kumuyi and Adeboye for defying its Twitter ban, the minister said: \u201cThe Attorney-General has made it clear that if anybody violates the regulation that such a person will be prosecuted and this is not about any particular person. It is in the realm of the Attorney-General to decide who or who not to prosecute.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Akwa Ibom, Uwemedimo Nwoko (SAN) has said that his current travails with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) may not be unconnected with his role against the anti-graft agency probing the government of former Governor Godswill Akpabio.\n\nNwoko who was quizzed by the EFCC recently over his role in various financial transactions of both the former and current administrations in the state spoke on a live radio programme in Uyo yesterday\n\nThe former AG who praised the EFCC for being civil, respectful and professional throughout the five days period of interrogation however expressed suspicion that the claims made against him by the agency could just be cover for the intention of punishing him for being the first lawyer to challenge the right of a federal agency to probe the activities of a state government in a federal state.\n\n\u201cLet me say this. When I came into office, EFCC was harassing the former governor, His Excellency, Senator Godswill Akpabio and trying to probe into the activities of the state government in the past, (before Udom Emmanuel).\n\n\u201cSo as a constitutional lawyer, I demanded to know the basis the EFCC as a federal agency was drawing it\u2019s powers from to come and query the way the state government was spending money from, in a federal republic like Nigeria. And I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the answer they gave me so I went to court.\n\n\u201cWe filed the very first suit of that nature in the whole country. I filed that suit in February 2017 and we were doing that matter all along. So because of that matter, we got an injunction stopping the EFCC from interfering with the transactions of the Akwa Ibom State government. Not the transactions of the days of governor Udom Emmanuel, transactions that happened before he came into government.\n\n\u201cWhen we got the injunction, the EFCC wasn\u2019t happy with me because they said such a thing has not happened before in the country, that I\u2019m the only person that came to do it and I told them that I swore to uphold the constitution and what I\u2019m taking to court for interpretation is the same constitution I swore to uphold.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is to send your lawyers to court to come and argue that matter. If they win, they win, if I win, I win. So because of the injunction, they couldn\u2019t access Akwa Ibom State. They couldn\u2019t make any serious incursion into the state. I think that was one of the reasons they were waiting for me. So, I also knew that when I left the government, that they would come for me. That\u2019s why I said I was expecting them and kept all my records very straight.\u201d He explained.\n\nHe explained that the N65 million out of N1.3B transferred to his account by a former NBA chairman, Mr Paul Usoro(SAN) that the EFCC said was a kickback was meant to pay lawyers of Akwa Ibom State extraction which he was under obligation to coordinate as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice adding that they were e-transfers and were verifiable.\n\n\u201cEFCC should have asked the circumstances under which Paul Usoro, SAN transferred 65 million naira to my account. As at the time 1.3 billion naira was paid to Paul Usoro, SAN, we were equally running 37 election tribunal matters, running four tribunals that were relocated from Uyo to Abuja.\n\n\u201cPaul Usoro was coordinating the entire legal team. Amongst the legal team were local lawyers, local lawyers in the sense of Akwa Ibom based lawyers and Paul Usoro was handling the Senior Advocates and the other lawyers from outside the state.\n\n\u201cHe mandated me as Attorney General to coordinate the home based lawyers. So the N65M was for the lawyers I coordinated. Good enough, it was not something that was hidden.\n\n\u201cThe statement of account which they already had in their file from Zenith Bank reflected that the money was transferred to my account on the 27th, August 2015, on the 28th, I started paying out the monies and good enough, they were all transfers, so they have it in their own record.\u201d He explained.\n\nNwoko dismissed the second allegation that he used funds from the Akwa Ibom State government through the Ministry of Justice to pay for the legal fees of Governor Emmanuel during the post election litigation challenging the victory of the PDP in the 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been because the legal fees of His Excellency, the governor, were paid totally from the party (PDP) coordinated arrangement. No one naira of Akwa Ibom State money was used to pay the legal bills of the governor. Not one naira and I told the EFCC that.\u201d The former AG said.\n\nHe added that he expected his arrest long before it came because, \u201cit was one of the things I expected. I expect that when I leave office, that I will be taken to anywhere in Nigeria, that I will be questioned, that I will be asked to make statements and clarifications\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been in the kind of office that I occupied, did the things I did, stepped on the toes I stepped on and you didn\u2019t anticipate that when you come out, that this kind of thing will happen. Possibly, it may not be the last time. Those things are expected\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I am ready for anything. If I\u2019m going to be charged to court, I\u2019ve made my statement. My belief is that when they read through my statement they need any further documents which are already available to them.\n\n\u201cThey have a team of lawyers to look at the documents and determine whether given what I have said, there is a valid case in court to pursue. If they don\u2019t have a case, they will also advise themselves properly.\u201d",

          "text": "The African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) has officially unveiled the \u201cCentre LSD Build Grant,\u201d to bridge the unacceptable gender imbalance in the extractive industry in the country.\n\nThe Centre said the Build Grant is for general support for strengthening an intersectional approach to gender and natural resources management, and a project for institutional strengthening.\n\nThe Programme Coordinator, Centre LSD, Ms. Victoria Udoh said this while unveiling the Grant in a press conference in Abuja.\n\nShe said that the Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives.\n\nShe added that the result of the above scenario is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\nMs. Victoria explained that the overarching goal of the project is to build strong and resilient organizations that will contribute to elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\nShe said that the project which is supported by Ford Foundation is divided into two fold, \u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions\u201d and \u201cProgrammatic Interventions\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions seeks to build the capacity of staff to deliver on the BUILD grant and beyond. It is also designed to strengthen the systems and structures of the Centre through the procurement of ancillary resources needed to interrogate systems, structures and practices that have put women and children in disadvantage in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile Programmatic Interventions is dedicated to the implementation of activities geared towards reducing the barriers faced by women in the extractive industry. During the project lifespan, activities and programmes to reverse the identified practices and barriers faced by women in the extractive sector will be our focus\u201d.\n\nGiving insight into factor that attracted the grant to the centre, Ms. Victoria said: \u201cIn Nigeria, women faces systematic discrimination in all phases of extractive industry. The entrenched gender bias not only prevents women from engaging in and accessing economic benefits, but also manifests in how companies and governments engage with communities at all stages of extractive activities. The Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives. The result is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\n\u201cThe African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) in sync with the government\u2019s determination to reform the extractive industry and diversify revenue sources to include non-oil revenue, implemented the strengthening civic engagement and advocacy for effective natural resource governance in Nigeria project. The aim was to mobilize citizens to participate in the governance of natural resources for the mineral sector to contribute significantly to the Gross Domestic Product. During the implementation of this project, emphasis was not placed on the humans as well the effect on men varies from effects on women and children. For example, as land is expropriated for extractive industry projects, so are family farms that women often manage. These farms give women the ability to earn income, some level of independence and decision making power in the household and community\u201d.\n\nTo address these anomalies, she concluded that the centre is implementing a grant, still in the extractive sector, specifically looking at how to integrate gender in its extractive work.",

Yakubu Pam has warned against taking pilgrims on pilgrimage outside the country without passing through the Commission, describing such as illegal.\n\nPam who disclosed this in his office in Abuja during a courtesy visit by the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria, CTPAN, said that no pilgrim would be allowed to travel out on Christian Pilgrimage without clearance from NCPC.\n\n\u201cIt is illegal for people to travel out of the country on pilgrimage without due respect to NCPC proceedings. That act will no longer be accepted by the Commission hence forth\u201d.\n\nThe NCPC boss explained that so many Christian Pilgrimage Operators, CPOs especially through the Lagos Airport have been taking people on pilgrimage without proper licensing and clearance from the Commission, he therefore vowed that his administration would ensure that those caught in the act would be brought to book.\n\n\u201cI have come on board to make sure that there is discipline and to ensure that there is no corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Executive Secretary encouraged the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria to always stand for truth and to discourage abscondment among their pilgrims.\n\nAccording to him, the essence of pilgrimage will be defeated if they are more concerned about their personal gain.\n\nHe intimated that the Commission would give the Christian Pilgrimage Operators one year renewal waiver of their license since pilgrimage exercise had been on hold for over one year due to COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nPam further charged the Association to ensure that the composition of their executive members should reflect national interest and not just from one geo-political zone of the country.\n\nEarlier, the President of the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria, Rev. Dr. Israel Kristilere thanked the Executive Secretary for receiving them despite his busy schedule.\n\nHe informed the NCPC boss that they were in NCPC to rub minds and seek his support on some of the issues the Association was passing through.\n\nIn his words \u201cwe want NCPC to carry us along on issues as it concerns pilgrimage\u201d.\n\nHe stated that due to COVID 19 pandemic, pilgrimage exercise has not been done for over a year and that NCPC should grant their members a one year renewal waiver of their license.\n\nThe Newly elected executive members of CPTAN were led by the former Chairman, Mrs. Adeola Adekola and other brand new executive members.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians have dragged the Federal Government to the ECOWAS court over the unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nIn the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed on Tuesday before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP and the concerned Nigerians are seeking: \u201can order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nFollowing the deletion of a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed last week announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe government has also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has asked all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nIn the suit filed by Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana SAN, the Plaintiffs contend that \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia.\n\nSERAP and the concerned Nigerians are therefore asking the ECOWAS Court of Justice for the following reliefs:\n\nA declaration that the action of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and microblogging application without an order of a competent court of jurisdiction is unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendant in mandating its agent to commence and continue to regulate the social media in Nigeria amounts to restriction and censorship, thus violating Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and microblogging application in Nigeria without any offence known to law is incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations, and are therefore null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\nA declaration that the directive by the Defendant, through the National Broadcasting Commission, directing and \u2018advising\u2019 broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and discontinue its use is a breach of the citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression, access to information as well as media freedom, and therefore, null and void.\n\nA declaration that the act of the defendant to frequently threaten Nigerians and other people who use Twitter and/or other social microblogging applications in Nigeria with criminal prosecution and the actual act of suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, violates the principle that there is no punishment without law, and the right to fair hearing, and therefore, null and void.\n\nAn order setting aside the suspension, ban, sanction or other punishments whatsoever imposed on Twitter, Nigerians, media houses, broadcast stations and any social media service providers by the Defendant and its agents.\n\nAn order directing the Defendant and its agents to immediately revoke, withdraw and/or rescind their suspension or ban of Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s) in Nigeria in line with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Revised ECOWAS Treaty 1993.\n\nAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions and other punishment including criminal prosecution or doing anything whatsoever to harass Twitter, broadcast stations, Nigerians and other people and any social media service provider(s), and media houses who are Twitter users.\n\nSuch further orders the Honorable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this suit.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the interim application and the substantive suit.",

          "title": "On First Overseas Trip, Biden to Reassure Allies Before Putin Meeting",
          "text": "Set to embark on the first overseas trip of his term, President Joe Biden is eager to reassert the United States on the world stage, steadying European allies deeply shaken by his predecessor and pushing democracy as the only bulwark to rising forces of authoritarianism.\n\nBiden has set the stakes for his eight-day trip in sweeping terms, believing that the West must publicly demonstrate it can compete economically with China as the world emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBuilding toward his trip-ending summit with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, Biden will aim to reassure European capitals that the United States can once again be counted on as a dependable partner to thwart Moscow\u2019s aggression both on their eastern front and their internet battlefields.\n\nThe trip will be far more about messaging than specific actions or deals. And the paramount priority for Biden, who leaves Wednesday for his first stop in the United Kingdom, is to convince the world that his administration is not just a fleeting deviation in the trajectory of an American foreign policy that many allies fear irrevocably drifted toward a more transactional outlook under former President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe trip, at its core, will advance the fundamental thrust of Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said national security adviser Jake Sullivan, \u201cto rally the world\u2019s democracies to tackle the great challenges of our time.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s to-do list is ambitious.\n\nIn their face-to-face sit-down in Geneva, Biden wants to privately pressure Putin to end myriad provocations, including cybersecurity attacks on American businesses by Russian-based hackers, the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and repeated overt and covert efforts by the Kremlin to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nBiden is also looking to rally allies on their COVID-19 response and to urge them to coalesce around a strategy to check emerging economic and national security competitor China even as the U.S. expresses concern about Europe\u2019s economic links to Moscow. Biden also wants to nudge outlying allies, including Australia, to make more aggressive commitments to the worldwide effort to curb global warming.\n\nThe week-plus journey is a big moment for Biden, who traveled the world for decades as vice president and as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and will now step off Air Force One on international soil as commander in chief. He will face world leaders still grappling with the virus and rattled by four years of Trump\u2019s inward-looking foreign policy and moves that strained longtime alliances as the former president made overtures to strongmen.\n\n\u201cIn this moment of global uncertainty, as the world still grapples with a once-in-a-century pandemic,\u201d Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed previewing his diplomatic efforts, \u201cthis trip is about realizing America\u2019s renewed commitment to our allies and partners, and demonstrating the capacity of democracies to both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age.\u201d\n\nThe president first travels to Britain for a summit of the Group of Seven leaders and then Brussels for a NATO summit and a meeting with the heads of the European Union. It comes at a moment when Europeans have diminished expectations for what they can expect of U.S. leadership on the foreign stage.\n\nCentral and Eastern Europeans are desperately hoping to bind the U.S. more tightly to their security. Germany is looking to see the U.S. troop presence maintained there so it doesn\u2019t need to build up its own. France, meanwhile, has taken the tack that the U.S. can\u2019t be trusted as it once was and that the European Union must pursue greater strategic autonomy going forward.\n\n\u201cI think the concern is real that the Trumpian tendencies in the U.S. could return full bore in the midterms or in the next presidential election,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. diplomat and once deputy secretary general of NATO.\n\nThe sequencing of the trip is deliberate: Biden consulting with Western European allies for much of a week as a show of unity before his summit with Putin.\n\nHis first stop late Wednesday will be an address to U.S. troops stationed in Britain, and the next day he sits down with British Prime Minster Boris Johnson. The two men will meet a day ahead of the G-7 summit to be held above the craggy cliffs of Cornwall overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe most tactile of politicians, Biden has grown frustrated by the diplomacy-via-Zoom dynamics of the pandemic and has relished the ability to again have face-to-face meetings that allow him to size up and connect with world leaders. While Biden himself is a veteran statesman, many of the world leaders he will see in England, including Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron, took office after Biden left the vice presidency. Another, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, will leave office later this year.\n\nThere are several potential areas of tension. On climate change, the U.S. is aiming to regain its credibility after Trump pulled the country back from the fight against global warming. Biden could also feel pressure on trade, an issue to which he\u2019s yet to give much attention. And with the United States well supplied with COVID-19 vaccines yet struggling to persuade some of its own citizens to use it, leaders whose inoculation campaigns have been slower will surely pressure Biden to share more surplus around the globe.\n\nAnother central focus will be China. Biden and the other G-7 leaders will announce an infrastructure financing program for developing countries that is meant to compete directly with Beijing\u2019s Belt-and-Road Initiative. But not every European power has viewed China in as harsh a light as Biden, who has painted the rivalry with the techno-security state as the defining competition for the 21st century.\n\nThe European Union has avoided taking as strong a stance on Beijing\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement or treatment of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province as the Biden administration may like. But there are signs that Europe is willing to put greater scrutiny on Beijing.\n\nThe EU in March announced sanctions targeting four Chinese officials involved with human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Beijing, in turn, responded by imposing sanctions on several members of the European Parliament and other Europeans critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBiden is also scheduled to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan while in Brussels, a face-to-face meeting between two leaders who have had many fraught moments in their relationship over the years.\n\nBiden waited until April to call Erdogan for the first time as president. In that call, he informed the Turkish leader that he would formally recognize that the systematic killings and deportations of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by Ottoman Empire forces in the early 20th century were \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 using a term for the atrocities that his White House predecessors had avoided for decades over concerns of alienating Turkey.\n\nThe trip finale will be Biden\u2019s meeting with Putin.\n\nBiden has taken a very different approach to Russia than Trump\u2019s friendly outreach. Their sole summit, held in July 2018 in Helsinki, was marked by Trump\u2019s refusal to side with U.S. intelligence agencies over Putin\u2019s denials of Russian interference in the election two years earlier.\n\nBiden could well be challenged by unrest at home as Russia looks to exploit the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection and the debate over voting rights to undermine the U.S. position as a global role model. The American president, in turn, is expected to push Russia to quell its global meddling.\n\n\u201cBy and large, these are not meetings on outcomes, these are \u2018get to know you again\u2019 meetings for the U.S. and Europe,\u201d said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s about delivering a message to Putin, to reviving old alliances and to demonstrate again that the U.S. is back on the right course.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on Tuesday announced the deactivation of his Twitter account.\n\nIt would appear the minister may have logged into the microblogging platform to carry out the action, but it\u2019s unclear how it was done since the Twitter URL has been suspended by network providers in the country.\n\n\u201cMy Twitter account deactivated,\u201d the minister posted a screenshot of the Twitter deactivation page on Facebook.\n\nReactions trailed the post as people under the minister\u2019s post queried Mr Malami on how he accessed his Twitter page despite the ban.\n\nOther commentators criticised the minister for alleged violation of their constitutional rights.\n\nSince the post was made by the minister there have been over 9000 reactions in 2 hours. Here are some of the reactions to Malami\u2019s post:\n\nRoy Ekwueme, a Facebook user wrote, \u201cThis is an evidence that you logged in Twitter today via VPN to deactivate your account which is punishable under your unlawful law. Let\u2019s see how you will prosecute others without throwing yourself in jail .\n\nAttorney General of nonsense and minister of injustice\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook user Charles Ugonna Okafor wrote, \u201cCan\u2019t you guys treat more pressing matters like insecurities, unemployment, corruption, epileptic power supply and lack of social amenities the way you were so fast in banning tweeter as if that\u2019s a fraction of our problems in this country?\u201d\n\nAwwal Seid wrote, \u201cThe new EFCC boss should go after you immediately! This is a criminal offence. How did you accessed your twitter account before deactivation or you made use of VPN?\u201d\n\nRita Orji wrote, \u201cYou actually logged in to Twitter to deactivate the account? How did you do that? You broke the law! Delete your Twitter account don\u2019t deactivate!\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook user Ehi Petebor wrote, \u201cThis guy! So you have to go on Twitter to deactivate your account. How possible? It simply means you were on Twitter today!\u201d\n\nAb\u00edmb\u00f3l\u00e1 Ol\u00e1b\u00f2d\u00e9 Ad\u00e9sh\u00edn\u00e0 wrote, \u201cWhy did it take you so long , how did you manage to deactivate after the ban sir. You must have connected with VPN before you can deactivate sir.\u201d\n\nAbdulhamid Marshall wrote, \u201cWith due respect, the North is keenly begging you to also deactivate banditry and kidnapping in the same haste you banned and deactivated Twitter.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

After having decided to ignore the ruling of the ECOWAS Court of Justice obliging it to release Alex Saab, Cabo Verde is now being called to order by the United Nations. No State respecting international law and the rule of law could legitimately ignore this new call to reason and to respect human rights.\n\nFor the record: The Committee\u2019s \u201cconsistent position\u201d is \u201cthat a failure to implement interim measures is incompatible with the obligation to respect in good faith the procedure for the consideration of individual communications under the Optional Protocol. The Committee reminded the State party that the obligations under the Covenant and the Optional Protocol are binding on the State party as a whole, including all branches of its Government.\u201d The State of Cabo Verde has been a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since August 6, 1993 and to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since May 19, 2000. Therefore, there is no doubt that Cabo Verde must comply with the interim measures according to its human rights obligations.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
