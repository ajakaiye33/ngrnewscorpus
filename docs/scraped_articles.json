          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday asked the federal government to count the state out of its planned rehabilitation of grazing reserve.\n\nGovernor Ortom stated this while reacting to the earlier statement of the Senior Special Assistant on Publicity and Media to the President, Mallam Garba Shehu, that the federal government was planning to rehabilitate the grazing reserve across the country.\n\nOrtom in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said that there is absolutely no land in the state that had been gazetted for grazing reserve.\n\nThe governor said that his state had since embraced ranching as the best global practice, the policy, he said that Southern Governors Forum and other prominent Nigerians had given their nod.\n\nHe expressed dismay on why the federal government is still pushing on what he described as archaic policy, stressing that \u201cit is now clear that there is a hidden agenda which only the Presidency knows.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, all the regions of the country have accepted the fact that open grazing of animals is no longer fashionable and should be banned to pave way for ranching, yet, the government at the centre is insistent that grazing reserves/cattle routes must be created across the country.\n\n\u201cIn Benue, we have embraced ranching as the viable alternative to open grazing and there is no going back on our resolve.\n\n\u201cOur ranching law which prohibits open grazing is Benue people\u2019s reaction to the incessant killings, and it is also an instrument of development. The law was enacted by representatives of the people in the Benue State House of Assembly, in exercise of its powers as provided for by Section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). Part 2 of the Second Schedule reinforces the power of the State House of the Assembly providing that \u201ca House of Assembly may make laws for the State with respect to industrial, commercial or agricultural development.\u201d The Law followed due process with public hearings and requisite opportunity for all stakeholders making input.\u201d\n\nThe governor said that while the state may not stop the Federal Government\u2019s plan to rehabilitate grazing reserves or create cattle routes in other states, \u201cWe wish to make it clear that no land in Benue State has been gazetted for grazing routes, grazing reserves, cattle colonies, and Ruga settlements.\n\n\u201cBenue is, therefore, not part of the grazing reserves rehabilitation programme of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cWe expect the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to weigh the negative consequences its recommendation will have on the unity and security of the nation and advise Mr. President that Nigerians are not on the same page with him regarding the matter of open grazing. It is not too late to salvage the situation.\n\n\u201cThe fact must be established that grazing reserves or cattle routes are no longer tenable in the 21st century when Nigeria\u2019s population far exceeds that of the fifties at a time these routes were contemplated.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses, and other human activities. The country\u2019s landmass has also reduced to less than 923 square kilometres with the excision of Bakassi to Cameroon. Besides, the international best practice of animal husbandry is ranching; and that\u2019s the stand of Benue State.\u201d\n\nOrtom stated further, \u201cRanching as a policy has the potential to launch Nigeria into 21st-century agricultural good practices. Today, open grazing is extinct in most countries of the world. In Europe, America, Asia, and in many countries in Africa, pastoralism has long given way to ranching.\n\n\u201cHow can Nigeria then still be battling with a problem of pastoralism that in other countries has been solved over a century ago? According to the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, India has 303 million cattle, Brazil, 226 million, China, 100 million, USA, 93 million, Argentina, 53 million, and Australia 27 million. All these countries ranch their animals. Nigeria has less than 20 million cattle which can easily be ranched. Unfortunately, the cows are allowed to either roam the streets freely or encroach on people\u2019s farms and other investments.\u201d",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA-GENDER advocates have tasked the governments at both the federal and state levels to give priority attention to sexual and gender based violence, regretting that lack of such was giving rise to the ugly situation in the country.\n\nThey particularly called on the government to set up special courts for offences of gender and sexual violence just as it did to COVID-19.\n\nThe advocates drawn from different civil society organisations and government sectors also attributed corruption to inability of the country to successfully tackle violence against women and girls.\n\nContributing variously during a media dialogue on Ethical Reporting and Advocacy to Eliminate Violence against Women and girls in the Federal Capital Territory,FCT, organised by Spotlight Initiative and other development partners,in Abuja,they insisted on the need for government to establish special court in the land.\n\nAccording to them, s low trials and corruption were seriously frustrating elimination of sexual and gender based violence in Nigeria.\n\nThey also attributed the rising cases of gender based violence in the country to corrupt security agents,who they accused of preferring to kill reported cases rather than ensuring justice. Noting that slow trial of offenders had adversely affected speedy dispensation of justice,they regretted that securing conviction against suspected sex offenders had become so difficult,a development they said,was frustrating efforts being made to eliminate Violence Against Women and Girls,VAWG,in Nigeria.\n\nThe Desk Officer, Federal Capital Territory,FCT, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Response, Ngozi Ike who disclosed that out of the 444 reported cases of sexual offences in Nigeria, only one conviction has so far been recorded this year, insisted there must be sanctions to serve as detriment to other perpetrators of SGBV.\n\nWhile noting that a multi sectoral approach was usually adopted in addressing cases of SGBV, she stressed that the establishment of special courts would hasten trials of suspected perpetrators and urge more survivals to break their silence.\n\n\u201cWe lack special courts in Nigeria to hear such delicate cases. When you take these cases to the regular courts, they linger for a long period of time and this is not good at all,\u201dshe said.\n\nIke added:\u201dIf we can push for the establishment of special courts that will preside over sexual and domestic violence cases, it will give long way in according justice to survivors.\u201d\n\nOn her side, the Child Protection Officer, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Tochukwu Odele, who noted that the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the indices of sexual violence in the country, said Nigeria\u2019s political structure was limiting implementation of legal and policy framework for gender laws.\n\nShe said majority of children in a survey conducted had experienced violence at home, adding that girls and women were at an increased risk for sexual violence, even as children who grow up in violent environments are at risk of perpetrating violence against the opposite gender when they grow up.\n\nAlso,the Chief, Child Protection Section of UNICEF, Ibrahim Sesay who reiterated UNICEF\u2019s commitment to protecting women and girls, said the media remains a strategic partner on advocating, mitigating and responding to issues surrounding women and girls.\n\nHe said:\u201dTo move and ascertain those results we have committed some funds globally to mitigate issues on violence against women and girls.\n\n\u201cThe voice of the media is powerful but it has to be ethical in nature, preserve the privacy of survivors and make sure we don\u2019t expose images of survivors that will be embarrassing to avoid stigmatisation of the survivors or revictimise them.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2022Drafted inhabitants to reinforce desecrated 1987 traditional peace oath\n\n\u2022Delta govt, villagers applaud Owhorode of Olomu-led peace team\n\nBy Ochuko Akuopha\n\nAN air of conviviality pervaded the secretariat of Isoko Development Union, IDU, Oleh, Delta State, last week, as the apex socio-cultural organisation of Isoko nation and traditional rulers from Urhobo and Isoko ethnic nationalities resolved the protracted land dispute between Igbide and Emede communities in Isoko South Local Government Area.\n\nThe resolution lays to rest the five- month old crisis that led to the killing of scores of persons and destruction of property worth millions of naira in neighbouring communities.\n\nThe frosty relationship between the communities had begun in 1985 when crisis erupted in the areas over land boundary dispute.\n\nThe development resulted in Isoko and Urhobo traditional rulers, steered by the Owhorode of Olomu Kingdom, HRM Ogbon Ogoni-Oghoro I and the Ovie of Uzere Kingdom HRM, Isaac Udogri, mediating and conscripting both communities into taking traditional peace oath in 1987.\n\nThe delicate peace that existed thereafter between the communities was, however, shattered on 8 December, 2020, as hostilities again broke out in the areas, desecrating the 34-year-old oath.\n\nPeace deal sealed at IDU secretariat\n\nWith disputes over boundaries at the Ewhokpaso land, Uziagwolo land, Oruzu land and Urie lake persisting, IDU, in an effort to restore peace to the warring communities initiated a reconciliation process, engaging the communities\u2019 leaders, local government council representatives, Peace Building and Conflict Resolution Committee representatives, traditional rulers, presidents-general of clans, security agents and others in an arrangement that was used in the peace deal.\n\nAt the IDU secretariat, venue of the final peace meeting convened by the leadership of IDU, Urhobo and Isoko traditional rulers, the fighting communities agreed to reinforce the 1987 traditional oath to ensure lasting and sustainable peace in the communities.\n\nThe meeting had the Owhorode of Olomu Kingdom, HRM Ogbon Ogoni-Oghoro I; Orodje of Okpe Kingdom, HRM Mujakperuo Orhue I, and 12 other Urhobo traditional rulers, nine Isoko monarchs led by Odiologbo of Oleh Kingdom, HRM Ovrawah Omogha I and Ovie of Uzere Kingdom, HRM Isaac Udogri in attendance. Others were the leadership of the IDU, representatives of the communities and security personnel.\n\nThe monarchs emphasized that the enforcement of the oath signified final peace among the people, holding that all land disputes and other issues that caused crisis between the communities stood resolved.\n\nThey counselled indigenes of the communities to steer clear of the canals demarcating the land boundaries, stressing that the landmarks remained sacrosanct features that cannot be altered.\n\nAmadhe gives details\n\nEarlier, immediate past president-general and Patron of the union, Chief Iduh Amadhe disclosed that a team comprising leaders of IDU and members of the two communities were engaged to undertake boundary demarcation, engaging the services of excavators to dig canals across the established boundaries to serve generations.\n\nHe added that all matters relating to the dispute before the police and the courts were to be withdrawn.\n\n\u201cSince we have played our own part, government should send their own surveyors and then plant permanent pillars in those areas that we have dug canals so that forever, nobody will talk about boundary between Emede and Igbide. Government should also resurface the roads between Emede to Igbide and Okpolo-Enhwe because they do not have good roads. What is there was done by the Shell Petroleum Development Company, SPDC, over 50 years ago,\u201d Amadhe asserted.\n\nAkpotu, Odhomor throw more light\n\nSpeaking with NDV on the resolution of the crisis, President-General of IDU, Prof. Chris Akpotu, expressed happiness that the matter had finally been laid to rest.\n\n\u201cWe prayed to God that God should help us. We went to the disputed land and we dug canals to establish boundaries and the final one was the traditional oath- taking,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, second Vice- President-General of IDU, Chief Daniel Odhomor, said: \u201cThere is no alternative to peace, war has never given any community any developmental benefit. That Igbide and Emene have agreed to sheath their swords and come together is the best thing that can happen to the communities. We are calling on government to also use this opportunity to help, so that we can develop some of the ravaged areas during the hostilities in both Igbide and Emede communities.\u201d\n\nIgbide, Emede monarchs banter\n\nThe meeting ended with exchange of pleasantries by the Ovie of Emede, HRM Johnson Eweri II, the Regent of Igbide, HRM Michael Ovadhe, President General of Igbide, Dr. Patrick Oboghor and his Emede counterpart, Dr. Benson Okah-Avae.\n\nRegent of Igbide kingdom, HRH Michael Ovadhe, said: \u201cThe oath which was formally taken in 1987 and desecration has been renewed. We, Igbide, are very happy. The blood that has been shed is enough. To avoid further bloodshed, that is why we agreed to take the oath.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re happy \u2013 Okah-Avae\n\nOn his part, President- General of Emede community, Dr. Benson Okah-Avae, in his reaction said: \u201cAs a community, we are happy about the resolution of the crisis because when there is peace, everyone is happy.

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has warned that allowing Chad Republic to destabilise would spell serious consequences for the peace and security of the countries in the Sahel and Chad Basin regions.\n\nThe President gave the warning on Tuesday while speaking at the opening of the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) in Abuja, calling on the international community to support Chad in its transition process from military to democratic rule.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, the event was convened to discuss the recent developments in Chad after President Idris Deby Itno died on the frontline, while defending the territorial integrity of his country.\n\nEmphasising the need to assist the country to conclude its transition to democracy within 18 months, as promised by the Chairman of the Transition Military Council, General Mahamat Idris Deby, President Buhari said it is sacrosanct, just as it must be driven with the guidance of the nation\u2019s constitution.\n\nHe, however, noted that the death of President Deby Itno had direct implications for the continued peace and stability of Chad as a nation, the Lake Chad region and the wider Sahel Region.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our region is faced with difficult, several challenges that need the support and engagement of all to overcome.\n\n\u2018\u2018While transnational crimes and rebellion cutting across our region continue to evolve in scope, the attendant conflicts also continue to retain their distinct form of inflicting untold hardship and difficulty on the lives of our citizens.\n\n\u2018\u2018The threats by the Chadian rebel groups, who are clamouring to overthrow the government, must be viewed with all the seriousness they deserve because the consequences of a destabilized Chad to the sub-region cannot be imagined.\n\n\u2018\u2018The flow of refugees and displaced persons from the country, unrestrained flow of arms, drugs and other harmful substances into Lake Chad and Sahel regions, which are already challenged by terrorists seeking to establish parallel systems, would further compound the security and stability of our areas and neighbouring countries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2018It is, therefore, our collective duty and in honour of the memory of the men and women that have died in search of peace in the region, to rise in unison as leaders of the region to ensure that peace, stability and security are not disrupted in Chad and in the entire region.\n\n\u2018\u2018These challenges, which are fueled by an interplay of poverty and the loss of sustainable means of livelihood due to climate change, have been further exacerbated by the direct consequence of complete breakdown of law and order in Libya.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Libyan conflict has increased fragility in our region with debilitating security implications across the Lake Chad and the larger Sahel Region, typified by increased circulation of illicit arms and ammunition, narcotic substances as well as a refugee crisis that continues to threaten the security of the region,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari, who declared the one-day summit open in his capacity as the Chair of leaders of LCBC member-countries, rallied development partners and countries, particularly France, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Russia; the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union, as well as other friendly and partner nations to support the transition framework put in place by Chad\u2019s Transition Military Council.\n\n\u201c\u2018The need to support the Chadian government to effectively carry out its planned 18-month transition is sacrosanct.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, it must be stated that the sanctity of the Chadian constitution as the supreme guiding document defining the social contract in the country must be respected.\n\n\u2018\u2018The transition period should be civilian-led, with requisite powers given to the constitutionally mandated organs of government saddled with the responsibility of administering the country,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari said.\n\nUrging fellow leaders not to relent in their efforts and allow the enemies of the region to succeed in their quest to destabilize the area, President Buhari said \u2018\u2018we must reinvigorate our collective will and commitment towards eradicating terrorism and entrenching democratic rule and good governance in Chad and in our region.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must remain focused and true to ensuring sustainable development of the region.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also used the occasion to commend the untiring efforts of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Multinational Joint Task Force, member countries\u2019 National Armed Forces and Security and Intelligence Agencies \u2018\u2018who daily strive to ensure the complete restoration of peace and stability in the region.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe pledged that officers, some of whom have paid the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty for the survival of the region, will never be forgotten.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are committed to ensuring that the ideals of restoring peace, stability and viability of the Lake Chad Region to its glorious state to which some of you have paid the ultimate price, is achieved,\u2019\u2019 he declared.\n\nOn the request of President Buhari and in recognition of the immense and sterling contributions of the late President of Chad to peace and stability in the region, the Summit observed a minute silence for the departed leader.\n\nEulogising the Marshal of Chad, President Buhari described the late President as a committed African leader and statesman who stood for peace and stability of the Lake Chad Region, the Sahel and the African continent in general.\n\n\u2018\u2018His passion, commitment and zeal to the cause of the Lake Chad and African unity would be greatly missed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe meeting was attended by the Presidents of Central African Republic, Niger, Chad, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya and a representative of the President of Cameroon.",

          "text": "By Abdullah Abdulganiy\n\nSIR: Immediate past President of the Nigerian Senate, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki needs some love at this critical juncture. The gentleman appears to be labouring in vain. Or how does one describe pouring water into a basket? An exercise in futility, isn\u2019t it? This is the analogy that best captures the travails of the erstwhile Kwara strongman in his role as chairman, Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s Reconciliation and Strategy Committee.\n\nSaraki has travelled North and South in his bid to reconcile warring PDP members, but his efforts are just falling flatly like a pack of cards. He meets warring party-men, and in a space of days, news of their defection filter through the media.\n\nAfter one of such meetings in Ogun State, he (Saraki) took to the social media to announce that his peace-building efforts are yielding positive results. But just some days later, scores of PDP members defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Director-General of Governorship Campaign Team of late Senator Buruji Kasamu in Ogun State 2019 election, Remilekun Bakare led the party men out of the opposition party.\n\nMore curiously, the PDP is also losing many of its bigwigs since the Saraki led Reconciliation Committee was formed. Dave Umahi, Governor of Ebonyi State is a political juggernaut and a master of the game. He dumped the PDP and simply identified with the APC in the very face of the Saraki led Committee. Umahi took along with him a horde of supporters, leaving PDP a deserted home.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust last week, governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade \u2018tore\u2019 the umbrella and \u2018lifted\u2019 the broom. He also took along with him scores of PDP faithful, in a manner that deals a devastating blow to the Saraki led Reconciliation Committee. That\u2019s not even the big deal.\n\nCharity, they say, begins at home. Not for Dr Bukola Saraki, the face of the PDP National Reconciliation Committee, who is also losing throng of PDP members to the APC fold in his native Kwara State. Recently, hundreds of PDP faithful in Baruten Local Government decamped to the APC. What\u2019s more is that some former gubernatorial candidates from other parties outside APC and PDP are finding refuge in the APC whenever they want to defect in the state.\n\nThe PDP lost it when it made Dr Saraki the face of its Reconciliation Committee. Was it not the same man who abandoned PDP, a party that made him just to satisfy his personal interest? How can such a personality reconcile aggrieved party men? It\u2019s not late for the PDP to rescind its decision to prevent more own goals for a party that has sunk already at the national level.",

          "text": "\u2022Okays ranching, revival of grazing reserves\u2019 take-off in June\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday took issue with Southern governors over their ban on open cattle grazing in the region.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his media assistant, Mallam Garba Shehu, described the ban, announced as one of the resolutions the 17 governors from the zone made during their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, as of questionable legality.\n\nAccording to him, the governors\u2019 action is of \u201cquestionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT)-regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nBuhari, hoever, approved ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nThe president\u2019s stance on the Southern governors\u2019 Asaba Declaration came a few days after the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), expressed similar views.\n\nMalami, while fielding questions on a live television programme, had kicked against the open grazing ban, saying it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe AGF had compared the Southern governors\u2019 decision to their Northern counterparts banning spare parts trading in the North, considering the fact that the majority of spare parts traders in the North are from the South.\n\nHe had said: \u201cIt is about constitutionality. Within the context of the freedoms enshrined in our constitution, can you deny a right of a Nigerian? It is as good as saying maybe the Northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a Northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the North?\u201d\n\nHowever, Malami came under fire over his criticism, with the Southern governors daring him to challenge their decision in the court.\n\nChairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had described Malami\u2019s opposition to the ban on open cattle grazing as \u201cwicked and arrogant.\u201d\n\nSome senior lawyers and the Founder of Stanbic IBTC and Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, also criticised the minister for his comments.\n\nWhile the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the spokesman of the Senate had called on Buhari to remove the minister for opposing the ban, the South-east Governors\u2019 Forum had said those who opposed the ban wanted the killings to continue.\n\nBut Buhari, while rejecting the governors\u2019 ban, expressed the determination of his administration to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe statement from the presidency said Buhari had approved some measures to permanently end the frequent skirmishes between farmers and herders as recommended by the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono.\n\nThe statement added that Nanono had submitted a report detailing the recommendations to the president, who endorsed it in April, \u201cwell before the actions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\nThe president said the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions didn\u2019t offer any solution to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in the country for generations.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut the citizens of the Southern states\u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria\u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFortunately, this declaration has been pre-empted, for whatever it is intended to achieve, and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizens in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\nIt added that despite the COVID-19 pandemic that took a toll on public finances, the federal funding for the forest reserve project is ready and will take off in interested states by June.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both federal and states. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualisation of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "OPS Excited over Manufacturing Sector\u2019s Recovery from COVID-19 Headwinds",
          "text": "By Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) have expressed excitement over the rebound of the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2021, which recorded a growth rate that was higher than its pre-COVID-19 performance.\n\nData released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020.\n\nThe data also showed that the manufacturing sector recorded a 3.40 per cent growth rate in Q1 2021 after recording negative growth in the Q4 of 2020.\n\nIn addition, its Q1 2021 performance was also higher than the 0.81 per cent and 0.43 per cent it recorded in Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 respectively, which were pre-COVID-19 era.\n\nMAN Director-General, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, while reacting to the GDP report said yesterday that the reported 3.40 per cent growth rate of the manufacturing sector in Q1 2021 came as a surprise, giving the numerous challenges facing the sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing the rising cost of manufacturing inputs, so it is surprising to see a rate higher than the rate of 0.81per cent in Q1 2019 and 0.43 per cent of Q1 2020, which were relatively stable periods.\n\n\u201cIn Q1 2021, manufacturing activities more or less rebounded to the level of pre-COVID-19 period. So, it is expected that the sector will present a better performance in Q1 2021 than what obtained in Q4 2020. Particularly the food, beverage, and tobacco and the chemical and pharmaceutical sub-sectors are expected to post higher growths due to the relatively higher capacities utilisation they enjoyed since 2020.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is not out of place for the cement and basic metal, iron, and steel sector to present high growths in Q1 2021 due to the increased level of construction work going on in different parts of the country backed by government spending across the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the NBS\u2019s Q1 2021 report on the manufacturing sector corroborated MAN\u2019s Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) of Q1 2021. The MCCI is a quarterly survey of the manufacturing sector. Its index showed improvement in the confidence of manufacturers in a good number of manufacturing sectoral groups.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the \u201cgovernment to intensify its intervention initiatives and follow through on the cost reduction aspect of ease of doing business. There is urgent need to create a friendlier operating environment and deliberately support the productive sector in a strategic manner.\u201d\n\nLCCI Director-General, Dr. Muda Yusuf, also stated that the recovery of the manufacturing sector from a negative growth territory in Q4 2020 to a positive growth level of 3.4 per cent in Q1 2021 was a surprise.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cThe sector has been grappling with an unprecedented foreign exchange illiquidity crisis over the past few months. This is coupled with the structural, policy, institutional and macroeconomic challenges that have bedeviled the sector. The data does not reflect the reality of the experiences of most manufacturers.\u201d\n\nBut the Chief Consultant of the B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, said during the breakfast meeting of the Nigeria-South Africa Chamber of Commerce held last Thursday that the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was recovering contrary to the sentiments that the manufacturing entities are closing down.\n\nAccording to him, there are enough activities along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Ogun State corridor where new factories are sprouting up to confirm the survey outcomes of the NBS.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese things are real. I can tell you here on authority that there are many conversations with foreign investors trying to put money into manufacturing in Nigeria as we speak. These are real foreign investors. I will not want us to go with the sentiment that nothing is happening there. You will see manufacturing always growing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

That is why we are hosting a summit of Lake Chad Basin Commission in Abuja, to discuss the situation in Chad, and the implications for neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cThe recharge of Lake Chad with water from Congo Basin is another issue, as it holds great implications for security, since about 30 million people are affected.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, President Touadera commiserated with his host over the military plane crash last weekend in Kaduna\n\nHe said Central African Republic was on the verge of rebuilding its Army, and would need Nigeria\u2019s help, as well as for Nigerian businessmen to come into the country to invest in diverse areas.\n\n\u201cWe want closer ties with Nigeria, and that is one of the reasons I am here,\u201d President Touadera said.\n\nAlso on Monday, President Buhari received a phone call from the Saudi Monarch and Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz who commiserated with the President and the people of Nigeria following the recent plane crash that claimed the lives of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru and ten other military officers.\n\nThe Saudi King expressed full solidarity with Nigeria following this national tragedy.\n\nPresident Buhari and the King exchanged pleasantries on the occasion of the Eid which was marked after the 30-day Ramadan fast and prayed for peace, security and progress in the two nations and the subregions.\n\nThe Saudi King also prayed for the repose of the souls of the military men who lost their lives.\n\nThe conversation by both leaders also covered the deep-rooted ties between the two countries and ways to bolster them across various sectors.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed happiness with the King and thanked him for standing with Nigeria in all situations.\n\nThe President also received a message of commiseration from Archbishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon, the Nigerian-born Secretary-General of the Anglican Communion, in London.\n\nArchbishop Idowu-Fearon prayed for the President and the country as the nation mourns the Chief of Army Staff and his top lieutenants at a time when their services were most needed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "#MySARSStory: Framed Into A Cultist",
          "text": "After his arrest, Eze Ebuka insisted he was not a cultist, so SARS tortured him into admitting he was.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m Eze Ebuka, a welder, and the first in a family of three.\n\nEze Ebuka\n\nThis is my SARS story.\n\nAround 1 am on Saturday, May 23, 2020, my sleep was disturbed by loud knocking on the door of the main entrance of my home in Ekwulobia, a town in Anambra state.\n\nFive officers of the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria police had come in over the fence, with guns and machetes, screaming my name.\n\nMy mother opened our door, asking why they were calling me at that hour. They said they had a message for me. My mother asked why they did not wait till daybreak. They did not answer, and instead forced their way past my mother, and into our house. They barged into my room - meeting me in my shorts. The officers asked me to throw on some clothes, then scattered my room, looking for something.\n\nI did not know what they were looking for but it was clear they didn\u2019t find it. They then handcuffed me, told my mother they had come from the Central Police Station (CPS) in Nnewi, 25 kilometers west of Ekwulobia. The officers said my mother would have to go to CPS if she wanted to know why I was being arrested.\n\nOn the way to the station, the officers asked me to provide names of five cult members if I wanted to be released. I told them I wasn\u2019t a cultist and did not know any cult members. But they accused me of lying and said they would make me confess at the station.\n\n\n\nForced confession\n\nWe got to the station at 3 a.m. and I was taken into custody with five other boys they had arrested that morning. I was told I would be the first suspect to be tortured in order for me to confess my cult membership.\n\nI was led somewhere within the station where I was asked to sit on the ground. They asked again if I was a cultist, and I continued to defend myself. I told them that I had a legitimate job that occupied me from the early hours of the day into late night. I told them I had nothing to do with cultists, and I knew of no other family member associated with cultism.\n\nThey didn\u2019t believe me. They started to torture me. They bound my legs and hands behind my back, with my head facing the ground. Two of the officers then put rods between my hands and legs, which they used to lift me so I\u2019d be suspended in the air.\n\nLet me tell you, it was a nightmare.\n\nThe rod started to injure my hands and legs, so I started crying. It was unbearable, and I remember shouting for help. Some officers came in, and I told them, out of desperation, that I was a cult member. I had no choice. I just wanted the torture to end.\n\n\u201cDo you belong to Aromate (a notorious cult group that usually causes trouble around the Ekwulobia town)?\u201d they asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I responded. I was at my breaking point.\n\n\u201cWhen did you join the cult?\u201d they asked.\n\n\u201cJanuary,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cHow many members were there when you got initiated?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d I lied in response.\n\nThey then told me that I had my finger punctured for a blood covenant as part of my initiation process. This was not a question - they were establishing it and asking me to accept it as truth. They were telling me what to say to suit their agenda.\n\nAfter they were satisfied that I was not resisting, they brought me down. They tortured the other five boys, most of whom were quick to admit to being cult members to escape being tortured.\n\nWe were then asked to write statements, which was further torture for me as my hands and fingers had become numb.\n\nInside the cell, we were beaten by the other inmates. At night, I could not sleep, not only because I was in pain, but also because there was no space for me to even lay my head.\n\nThe cell conditions were terrible. Inmates urinated and emptied their bowels at the same place they slept. The officers did not care whether we ate or not - I only drank water, as they didn\u2019t allow my people to bring me food.\n\nAll the officers cared about was when our relatives would come to bail us, or if we wanted to make calls to our relatives at a fee they would charge us.\n\nMost people I met in the cell seemed to have stories that suggested they had been wrongly arrested. Some of them told me they had been arrested in place of their sons, whom SARS officers had come in search of and hadn\u2019t found.\n\nI later learned that three of my uncles drove for one hour to the station on the evening of the day of my arrest, but the SARS officers had told them that the officer in charge (OC) was not around. My uncles had to leave and come back again, only to be told the same story. The officers said the OC was yet to return and that it was not possible to obtain bail on a Sunday. My uncles tried again on Monday, then Tuesday, all without success.\n\nOne of my uncles got annoyed and threatened to sue unless the officers provided evidence of my cult membership, to which the officers responded by revealing that their OC had miraculously returned.\n\nThey asked my family to pay 200,000 naira before they would let me go. My family raised half the money, but the officers claimed it was not enough, especially as it was a cult case.\n\nAfter three days of detention, the officers accepted the 100,000 naira and let me go.\n\nBack to a difficult life\n\nMy mother cried when I returned home.\n\nBefore my arrest, I had been saving up to buy my own tools to help me grow out of my apprenticeship, but my savings were pumped into negotiating my freedom.\n\nFollowing my injuries from the torture, I was stuck at home for three weeks, unable to work.\n\nIn my neighbourhood, people really believed that I was a cultist, after hearing that I had confessed to being one. They said I was a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing, a cult member pretending to be a \u2018holy boy\u2019.\n\nTo clear my name, I had to go to the local government office to get a court affidavit rejecting cultism. But not even this could change what people thought of me.\n\nI will never forget what I went through. I doubt if I am over it. SARS wounded my body and destroyed my reputation.\n\nIt was not a funny experience.\n\n_______\n\nThis story is part of a multimedia project by Tiger Eye Foundation and media partners across Nigeria, documenting police brutality in Nigeria, and advocating for police reform.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerian financial data startup Mono has raised a seed round of $2 million from a number of investors including Entr\u00e9e Capital and Lateral Capital.\n\nBabs Ogundeyi, co-founder and CEO of Kuda; Gbenga Oyebode, partner at The Continent Venture Partners; and Eric Idiahi, co-founder and partner at Verod Capital, also invested according to TechCrunch.\n\nMono was founded in 2020 by Abdul Hassan, a former product manager at Paystack, and Prakhar Singh. The company\u2019s technology enables businesses and individuals to gain access to financial information, such as account statements, stored at commercial banks.

A consortium of three companies (Interconnect Limited, Saab Grinteck and Telecordia) currently acts as the Number Portability Clearing House (NPCH) for the industry.\n\nHassan also told TechCrunch that Mono will be going live in Ghana by June and that they already have five banks and MTN Ghana\u2019s mobile money service as partners.",

          "title": "Samsung A12 Vs Infinix HOT 10T: Which Is A Better Buy?",
          "text": "Infinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A-game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colors that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inches. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of the display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equal higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed by the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk about the battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries apiece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google-sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version of android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords has now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternative solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Side-mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed to). It\u2019s a lot easier and more seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.",

          "title": "New FirstBank Website Puts YOU, the customer, First!",
          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nInfinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colours that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inch. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equals higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries a piece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords have now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternate solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear mounted finger print censor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side mounted fingerprint sensors. Side mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed with). It\u2019s a lot easier and seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Egyptian agritech startup, Mozare3, has raised over $1 million in a pre-seed round. Algebra Ventures, Disruptech, and some angel investors like EFG-EV, participated in the round.\n\nMozare3 CEO, Hussein Abou Bakr, and his Co-founder, Tamer El-Raghy, founded the company in 2020 to assist more than 20 million smallholder farmers in Egypt by making markets and credits accessible to them.\n\nThe startup also plans to develop the first digital community for Egyptian farmers and offer them agronomy support through its professional network.\n\nThe agritech startup assists farmers sell their crops by working with institutional buyers like frozen vegetable processors, large retailers, and wholesalers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe farmers sign an offtake agreement \u2014 an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer\u2019s future goods \u2014 with Mozare3 to sell their produce at a particular price for institutional buyers.\n\nThis reduces the likelihood of the farmers not getting buyers after the harvest season. Most importantly, it encourages farmers to focus on their work without worrying about after-harvest sales.\n\nAccording to MENabytes, Abou Bakr said they currently have offtake agreements with 100 farmers and three large institutional buyers.\n\nAlthough most of Mozare3\u2019s work is done offline, a small group of farmers is currently beta testing its app.\n\nWith the app launch at the end of 2022, the company wants to reach over 10,000 farmers.\n\nIt would also allow farmers to access credit, receive agronomy support, buy fertilisers and other products to grow crops, and sell their products through its digital offtake agreements.\n\nAbou Bakr has over 20 years of experience in subsistence and commercial farming, food processing, and international trading. Before he founded Mozare3, he founded an agri processor and exporter, Plantform, that used to source produce from smallholders in over ten governorates in Egypt.\n\nThe CEO and the team hope to increase Mozare3\u2019s network to over 2,500 farmers with whom they have offtake agreements and increase its institutional buyers to over 37.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Egyptian agritech startup plans to introduce credit solutions to fund purchases of different products like motorbikes for the farmers and their families.\n\nEl-Raghy believes that Mozare3 would make supply more efficient by providing farmers with innovative financial products and turning them into contract farmers to fulfil consumers\u2019 growing demand, processors, and exporters.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately 24 million people \u2014 over one-quarter of the population \u2014 work in Egypt\u2019s farming and fishing sectors. And being a major component of the economy, 6.5 million people depend on agriculture for survival.\n\nPerhaps Mozare3\u2019s plans to develop its tech, expand its team, and grow its network of farmers would help farmers and boost the economy as agriculture contributes 11.3% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: MENAbytes\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Poor hearts in barrels of harmful oils",
          "text": "As unbridled access to unhealthy fats consumption increasingly hurts the human heart, thousands of Nigerians die prematurely from cardiovascular diseases. Poor dietary contents such as trans-fat and unsaturated fat combine with hypertension, diabetes and obesity for a fatal damage.\n\nIn this investigation, TEMITAYO AYETOTO for two months combed five major food markets in Lagos for some of the cheapest, unbranded vegetable oils in demand, as well as some pricier branded ones. The samples were sent to a federal laboratory for analysis, which jarringly reveals that neither the rich nor poor are safe.\n\nIf lower price points in some food products only meant sacrificing aesthetics or taste alone, life expectancy may not become a concern. Regrettably, it doesn\u2019t end there. It lures Nigerians into paying less for big troubles.\n\nWith cooking oils, unbeatable low prices place the crown on unbranded vegetable oils, often bottled in disused table-water containers and given different market names you will never find on any known product.\n\nThis is where the preference of Jumoke Akinrinwale lies.\n\nExcept during the festive month of December, when her husband\u2019s employer gifts him two litres of sealed oil, labelled with a proper breakdown of fat contents, the expectant mother of two doesn\u2019t play near branded oils.\n\nShe sets up her sewing machine in the tiny open veranda of a bungalow where she lives at Papa-Ajao, Mushin \u2013 a congested area of Lagos.\n\nShe can\u2019t afford a decent shop yet, and can\u2019t shop pricey options of healthy oils either, despite the common perception that branded oils are healthier than \u2018killer\u2019 unbranded oils.\n\n\u201cBefore, I could buy 2\u00bd litres of unbranded oil with N1, 250 ($2.6). But now, that amount can only buy 1.5 litres,\u201d said the expectant mother. \u201cAnd I cook always. Those who can buy branded oils are rich people,\u201d she stressed, apparently hurting from the brunt of rising food prices.\n\nHer weekly cooking routine often includes vegetable oil. If it\u2019s not rice and stew requiring an average of 20 centiliters of oil, then it is jollof rice.\n\n\u201cOn weekends I make soups mixing palm oil and vegetable oil. If I try to use branded oils, do you know how much that will cost in a week?\u201d Akinrinwale queries, her lips parted and eyes bulging.\n\nThe least her household consumes is 1.2 litres of vegetable oil every week. Buying branded Devon King\u2019s vegetable oil, for instance, will cost her 22 percent more at N1, 320 as of April 13. The same quantity of a rival brand, Power Oil, will cost 35 percent higher at N1, 466.\n\nSticking to an unbranded oil, however, will cost her a maximum of N1, 180 as of the time of writing this report. But she might part with unbranded oils if she increases the charges of her tailoring services, and is able to stop her clients from looking elsewhere for cheaper sewing.\n\n\n\nHers is a reality reflecting the current frustration of an estimated 87 million poor Nigerians, trapped in the web of an economy with one of the highest food prices in the world and a high unemployment rate.\n\nThe ugly situation combined with a rising population rate, sinks six Nigerians into extreme poverty each minute, according to a 2018 report by the Brookings Institution. The global research body in 2019 forecast that Nigeria will be home to 110 million people living in extreme poverty by the year 2030, if it is unable to change its current trajectory.\n\nAt 21.97 percent as of February, Trading Economics, an open data source on global food inflation, ranks Nigeria\u2019s food inflation 11th highest among 169 countries.\n\nThe middle class appears squeezed under fast declining incomes. People are increasingly looking for low prices, likely leading them into harm\u2019s way.\n\nCooking oil analysis\n\nWith mounting concerns from global and local health monitoring groups on the perils of dangerous levels of unhealthy fats present in common diets, BusinessDay\u2019s correspondent, supported by the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), examined five samples of vegetable oils that are leading market demand in Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, Lagos.\n\nThe laboratory investigation was conducted at the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, and the results were alarming. Nigerians not only pay for heart-harming oils at a discount, they equally pay higher under a false belief of buying the safest and sealed oils.\n\nThe analysis primarily sought to weigh the harmful levels of fatty acids that make up the total fat content in these oils. Fatty acids are the building blocks of the fat in our bodies and in foods. During digestion, the body breaks down fats into fatty acids, which can then be absorbed into the body.\n\nFive food markets known for vegetable oils, including a company dealing purely in wholesale distribution of unbranded oils at Ijesha Market, Lagos were combed for five different samples.\n\nThree of the samples sourced from Agege, Ijesha and Iddo markets were the most sought-after unbranded vegetable oils market-wide, while two are popular brands processed by known companies \u2013 Devon King\u2019s and Power Oil.\n\nIn the local market parlance of oils with origins difficult to trace to specific producers, \u2018Nigerian Kings,\u2019 \u2018AVOP\u2019 and \u2018Cotonou Kings\u2019 exist.\n\nFor instance, the Anambra Vegetable Oil Products Ltd. (AVOP) used to be produced in the 1980s by a state-financed plant that now lies in ruins.\n\nYet, oils identified as AVOP remain the cheapest available in food markets, even with the pressure of pandemic-induced food price hikes.\n\nHameesu Ado, a young dealer at Iddo market, one of the most visited food markets in Lagos, sells up to 500 units of 25 litres of \u2018 AVOP\u2019 vegetable oils weekly.\n\nThese kinds of oils flow in from different smuggling routes including unlicensed refining stations locally.\n\nThe collected samples were stored in plain bottles and renamed before for testing.\n\nNigerian Kings was codenamed \u2018Apple\u2019, AVOP was labelled \u2018Orange\u2019,\u2019 Cotonou Kings dubbed \u2018Banana\u2019, Devon King\u2019s tagged \u2018Cherry\u2019 and Power Oil marked \u2018Lemon\u2019.\n\nThe chief technologist at the testing institute had no idea of their original brand names or sources. Within a week, the results were out, indicating they all had undetectable levels of trans fat, which in other words implies they were at least free of one harmful type of fat.\n\nThe results get ugly\n\nIronically, one of Nigeria\u2019s most trusted branded oils that even comes with the company seal, Devon King\u2019s vegetable oil, recorded the highest level of saturated fat of 78.6 percent, a level bad for regular consumption, and worse for heavy intake. Yet, PZ Wilmar Limited, the producer of the oil in Nigeria gives the nutrition labelling a facelift that covers the hidden harms found through lab testing.\n\nThe company puts the maximum saturated fat level at 50 grams, presuming that amount makes up only 35 percent of the cumulative fat of 142 grams stated in the labelling.\n\nBut at 78.6 percent, the lab analysis shows 43.6 percent more of saturated fat is understated in the product labelling.\n\nThe sample has its registration number from the National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) as B1-7531 and the barcode as 6154000015404.\n\nFor Power Oil, another famed brand for packaged oil that its selling point is the assurance of ultimate protection of heart health, the disclosure of fat amounts is quite consistent with the lab results except for the saturated fat level. The NAFDAC registration numbers are B1-8258 and the barcode numbers are 6156000100012.\n\nThe saturated fat level is 64.4 percent according to the laboratory analysis. But the product labelling states it as 42.8 grams, implying 28.7 percent of the total fat of 157.2 grams.\n\nAs much as 35.7 percent of saturated fat is understated, by the producer, Raffles Oil LFTZ Enterprise, a subsidiary of Dufil Group.\n\nThis is a company that labels \u2018unbranded oils\u2019 as the enemy of Nigerians\u2019 hearts while promoting awareness on the importance of consuming healthy oils with its brand.\n\nThe first paragraph of the product\u2019s bio page online, presents a narration of how people ignored the dangers of unhealthy fats to buy cheap and unhygienic unbranded oils before it came into the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cPeople would buy it just because it was cheap, paying little attention to other important health factors,\u201d the bio says.\n\nUnfortunately, the company falls in the range of some denigrated unbranded oils in terms of saturated fats.\n\nAVOP, an unbranded oil that was tested, has a total saturated fat of 70 percent.\n\nThe oil is notorious for \u2018sleeping\u2019 that all of the 20 merchants surveyed on oil types identified it as a tough sell during the rainy season. Its soggy nature makes it difficult to refill.\n\nAnother unbranded oil that was also tested, \u2018Nigeria Kings\u2019, has a total saturated fat of 69.6 percent.\n\nIronically, when compared with \u2018Cotonou Kings\u2019, yet another unbranded oil bought from Iddo market, Ebute Meta, the analysis paints a picture where Mrs Akinrinwale with her paltry income could be consuming a healthier oil.\n\nOf the five samples tested, the oil surprisingly has the lowest total saturated fat level of 30 percent. This is an unbranded oil without labelling.\n\nAccording to the note that came with the result, it \u201ccontains the largest amount of DHA and omega 3 out of all the samples and it is the best in terms of consumption with low saturated fat and high polyunsaturated fat.\u201d\n\nIt is one of the oils that even sellers distrust due to its porous means of sourcing and the high chance of adulteration.\n\n\u201cCotonou is a dumping place and that\u2019s why rice and oils from there are banned. Some of the oils coming from there are rebranded there, not the real content,\u201d Olajoke Yusuf, a semi-wholesale dealer at Agege Main Market told BusinessDay.\n\nOverstating healthy fats levels\n\nPart of findings from the laboratory analysis in this investigation, is the inconsistency of facts from the branded oil companies that unfortunately command the largest share of public trust.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the laboratory analysis, Devon King\u2019s sample contains 6.3 percent of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and 15 percent of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA).\n\nBut, the company states more when it is actually less. It overstates MUFA as 26.7 percent on the product labelling.\n\nInterestingly, PUFA is understated as 5.6 percent on the labelling data when lab analysis indicates it is 15 percent.\n\nThese fats offered in low amounts are healthier fats for consumption than saturated and trans fats, according to facts about fats featured in the medical encyclopedia of the US National Library of Medicine. They are naturally present in plant foods, such as vegetable oils, nuts and avocados.\n\n\u201cThey can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol level. Cholesterol is a soft, waxy substance that can cause clogged, or blocked blood vessels. Keeping your LDL level low reduces your risk for heart disease and stroke,\u201d the dietary piece states.\n\nInterestingly, unbranded \u2018Cotonou Kings\u2019 contains the highest volume of PUFA of 66 percent while MUFA is 3.6 percent.\n\nPower Oil\u2019s monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats stated as 28 percent (45.5g) and 7.4 percent (11.7g) align with the analysis results, although low by dietary standards.\n\nAVOP oil has monounsaturated fat of 12.5 percent and polyunsaturated fat of 16.9 percent.\n\n\u2018Nigeria Kings\u2019 has monounsaturated fat of 7.2 percent and polyunsaturated fat of 23 percent.\n\nWhat do saturated fats mean?\n\nMost food products have a combination of different fats generally classified as saturated, trans fat, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega 3, 6, or 9, and cholesterol among others.\n\nTrans fat and saturated fat are exactly the sorts of fat threats that should have their levels kept very low to cut risks of heart diseases. Trans fats are unsaturated fats present in foods such as dairy products and meat, and in industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO).\n\nHigh levels of the duo trigger a build up of harmful cholesterol in the blood vessels, raising risks for heart disease and stroke.\n\nOut of the top 10 diseases driving deaths in Nigeria, ischemic heart disease is ranked 6th (24. 7 percent) and stroke 7th (17 percent) by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), a global body that measures and forecasts health events.\n\nIn 2019, cardiovascular diseases largely believed to be worsened from diets with high trans fatty acids led to 3, 229 deaths in Nigeria, and 3,102 in 2017.\n\nGlobally, it claimed 612, 668 lives in 2017 and 644, 980 in 2019, based on IHME data.\n\nOlufemi Fasanmade, a professor of Medicine at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos warned that trans and saturated fats consumption contribute to the rising prevalence of heart problems, other than factors such as obesity, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and increasing stress.\n\n\u201cHeart disease is on the increase in Nigeria mainly due to the changes in lifestyle to the Western diet,\u201d the professor told BusinessDay.\n\nEugene Nwosu, consultant cardiologist and chief medical director, United Heart Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos agrees with Fasanmade, saying common fries such as chin chin, cakes and doughnuts often increase bad cholesterol in the body due to a cooking process capable of converting oils to more dangerous trans fat.\n\nBut mirroring the pattern of causes peculiar to most cases seen over the last four years of his practice in Nigeria, Nwosu said high blood pressure is a top trigger of heart attack and stroke, and many move about without a clue they live with the silent killer.\n\nOn top of that woe, many Nigerians have unfettered availability of unhealthy oils in their food supply.\n\n\u201cThe culprit is mainly oils that are rich in saturated fat. They should be minimised. People need to understand how to properly read labelling when shopping,\u201d the American College of Cardiology Fellow explained.\n\n\u201cThe type of oil you eat can definitely affect your cholesterol, which increases build up of clogs in the blood vessels. The oil that is good for cooking is the oil that is high in polyunsaturated fat and also high in monounsaturated fat.\u201d\n\nDiscomforting data such as these have increasingly sparked calls for the replacement of trans fat globally. But it is also spinning unintended outcomes as companies such as PZ Wilmar Limited shift to unsafe limits of saturated fat.\n\nA 2020 report on sources and replacement solutions for trans fatty acid in Nigeria, shows that while the availability of technology for breaking down raw materials such as crude palm oil makes replacement easier for local companies, \u201cone key challenge is balancing cost implications of the replacement options with the overall health impact and the need to limit the content of saturated fat in the reformulated products.\u201d\n\nThe irony in it is that Nigerians who think they pay higher for healthier oils might actually end up with unhealthy oils.\n\nWhen BusinessDay\u2019s correspondent visited Oyingbo market, Tope Ojasanya, a woman in her early 40s with a thriving food business was excited touting how she has managed to stick with Devon King\u2019s oil despite the economic hardship.\n\nFor her, it is about sustaining the legacy of \u2018quality inputs\u2019 that her mother left in the 28-year-old business before she passed away last year.\n\nHer canteen tops the list of go-to places for lovers of deep-fries, craving to be spoilt for choices from doughnuts to akara (bean cake), potato, yam, and even mashed beans and oil-pampered stew.\n\nEven though sales are yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, the business consumes about 37.5 litres of Devon King\u2019s oil daily.\n\n\u201cIt looks inviting, tastes good, and lasts longer. With the nature of what we sell, taste matters a lot,\u201d Ojasanya said, with no inkling of underlying features of the oil.\n\nGenerally, most unbranded oils are cheaper and offer similar levels of unhealthy fat for millions of poor Nigerians who are more bothered about what to eat than the healthiness of what is eaten.\n\nHowever, as this investigation has shown, some packaged and more expensive vegetable oils beyond the reach of the poor will not save the rich from heart harm either.\n\nConsistent regulation of industrial processes, increased awareness of dangers and policies that compel producers to replace trans fat and saturated fats, will save Nigerians, health analysts say.\n\nAccording to suggestions from \u2018Mapping of Industrially-Produced Trans-Fatty Acids (iTFA) in Nigeria,\u2019 the 2020 report on sources and replacement solutions in Nigeria, trans fats and saturated fats can be replaced with unsaturated fats that have not gone through the industrial process of partial hydrogenation through reformulation.\n\nIn January, the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) asked NAFDAC to push for the approval of the Fats and Oils Regulations Bill as a New Year gift to Nigerians.\n\nThe group charged the food and drug regulator to set in motion the process for the draft Oil and Fats Regulation Bill 2019 to be passed so that Nigerians are guided by approved regulations on trans fats in foods.\n\nMoji Adeyeye, NAFDAC director-general in a mailed response to BusinessDay\u2019s questions on regulation and labelling irregularities said there has been a revision of the fats and oils regulations which has set limits for trans-fat with the aim of ultimately eliminating it from the Nigerian food supply.\n\nThe revised regulation, which is stuck in the approval stage, stipulates that consumption of trans fat shouldn\u2019t exceed 2 gram per 100g of fat or oil.\n\nThe regulation further provides that for a food product which contains 2g of fat or more per 100g of the final product, the nutritional label should indicate the types and levels of each of the fat components in the product as saturated fatty acids, trans fat acids and cholesterol.\n\nHowever, developments with increasing shifts towards saturated fat show that NAFDAC must do more than raising awareness on implications of trans fat and address the fallout of the shift towards other unhealthy levels.\n\nSome companies with unhealthy fat levels deceptively understate it on their product labelling verified by NAFDAC in a brazen attempt that undermines the health of millions of Nigerians.\n\nWhen NAFDAC was contacted again to ascertain the acceptable level for saturated fat in vegetable oils, BusinessDay was told there is no set standard for it, but only for trans-fat. This reporter was instead referred to the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), which according to NAFDAC \u201csets such standards\u201d. After several attempts to also get SON to state what is acceptable saturated fat level in vegetable oils, Bola Fashina, SON\u2019s head of public relations said \u201cthe saturated fat is listed in the fatty acid clause of the various Nigerian Industrial Standards for the different vegetable oils. Not broken down as saturated or unsaturated.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear if there is an actual standard, which vegetable oil producers are abusing. Perhaps, riding on the saying; where there is no law, there is no sin.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture, however, saturated fat should not exceed 14 percent of the total fat content in 100 percent pure vegetable oil. None of the samples tested in this investigation met this standard, in the absence of clear-cut standards from the Nigerian authorities.\n\nThis story was supported by the Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) and Code for Africa via its Wanadata Community Initiative.",

          "text": "After Nigeria lifted the lockdown on economic activities due to the coronavirus pandemic last year, the expected boom in road transport has not materialised as Nigerians are running scared of roads fast morphing into hunting grounds for kidnappers, new data show.\n\nDeclining road transport in an economy struggling with sluggish growth in a country with a poorly developed transport system has serious implications on trade and services.\n\nRising insecurity is showing up in local trade statistics as the sector contracted 2.43 percent in the first three months of 2021, making it the eighth consecutive quarterly contraction since the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThe quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates for the four quarters of 2020, the annual figure for 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows a decline of -23.75 percent in Road Transport GDP in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter.\n\nThe Federal Government began a phased opening of the lockdown measures from May 4 last year in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states, and proceeded more slowly in other parts of the country towards the end of the year.\n\nThe restriction on interstate travels outside curfew hours was lifted from July 1, 2020, and by the end of the year, any pretence of enforcement was all but gone. Yet, this has not translated into a boom.\n\nRead Also: Rising insecurity amid humongous security votes\n\nThe NBS data show a drop in road transport to -23.75 percent in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter after all restrictions to road transport have been lifted.\n\nContrast this by a drop of -51.17 percent in the second quarter of 2020, when the government announced a ban on all travels in the country.\n\nRoad transport moderated slightly to -46.64 percent in the third quarter, then it rose to -1.37 percent and by the fourth quarter of 2020 only to enter abnormal territory, falling sharply to -23.75 percent.\n\nAnalysts attribute this dip to the impact of pervasive insecurity in the country marked by violent kidnappings, robberies and banditry across major highways.\n\n\u201cSecurity has a big role to play with this decline,\u201d notes Confidence Owamninaemi, a Lagos-based security analyst at SBM Intelligence, a geopolitical intelligence platform.\n\nSome of the most notorious routes in Nigeria include the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Kaduna-Abuja Expressway, Katsina/Ala \u2013 Wukari Road, linking Benue and Taraba states, Birnin Gwari-Kaduna Road; Kaduna-Saminaka-Jos Road, Enugu-Port Harcourt Road, among others.\n\nMoses Ojo, Lagos-based economic analysts, also points to pervasive insecurity in the country that culminated in the ENDSARS protests, which led to many buses leaving the road due to the burning and vandalising.\n\nAttacks on private and commercial buses in the night used to be a feature of road transport on notorious highways but has since morphed into blood lust by criminal gangs who get a vehicle to stop by mowing down the driver with a hail of bullets. Then, they kidnap whoever is left alive helping to turn kidnapping into an industry.\n\nOn March 13, Muhammed Usman took a bus from Gusau, the capital city of Nigeria\u2019s north-west state of Zamfara, to see his family in Dangulbi, a small farming community about 50 kilometres away.\n\nHalf an hour into the trip, the bus came under heavy fire. An armed gang shot at the travellers from the front and rear end of the vehicle for several minutes. Usman grabbed a child who sat next to him and crouched down beneath the seat, covering him with his body.\n\nIn January, 30 people were killed and possibly 100 kidnapped in a single incident on the Kaduna-Zaria highway in Kaduna State. The perpetrators were dressed in military uniforms. Among the wounded was the Emir of Potiskum.\n\n\u201cTo travel by road in Nigeria is now an extreme sport,\u201d Owamninaemi says.\n\nThe NBS data further reveal that while road transport was falling, air transport, which has slowed since the pandemic, moderated by about 40 percent in the first quarter of 2021, while rail transport also saw a similar uptick.\n\nHowever, these modes of transport are not well suited to trade in a country that largely depends on its 195,000km of sketchy road network of which about 60,000km are paved. Their limited freight capacity still makes roads the most effective in facilitating trade.\n\nTravellers on these roads report higher fares as transport companies price security risk into the fare. For example, transport fare from Lagos to Benin City, which used to be around N3,500, has risen to over N7,500. Similar routes have also seen over 100 percent rise in fares.\n\nAnalysis by the Council of Foreign Relations notes that kidnapping for ransom, once largely confined to the Southern part of Nigeria, has now spread throughout the country.\n\n\u201cMilitant and criminal groups, including Boko Haram, resort to kidnapping for ransom to raise funds,\u201d the group states.",

And don\u2019t underestimate the possibility of being found out when carrying out sensitive duties.\u201d\n\nHe urged journalists to always get the highest standard of protective equipment.\n\nAccording to Fisayo, careful collaboration with trusted source is key in investigative journalism and urged participants to always create an exit strategy before embarking on sensitive assignments.\n\n\u201cNo big investigation can be done alone. You need fixers, information, perspectives that can only be possible when you interact with people. And they can make or mar you and your investigations. So, trust people in circumspect,\u201d Soyombo warned.\n\nHe cautioned journalists to always seek professional advise especially during pandemics so as to protect themselves , family and people around them.\n\nHe urged participants to read and write as often as possible and count the cost and be ready to pay the prize for the outcome of their investigation but however warned that no investigation was worth their lives.\n\nOther speakers at the training included Dr. Uzo Israel, Clinical Psychologist at the Department of Psychology, University of Lagos (UNILAG), who spoke on \u201cthe topic \u201cManaging Stress , Trauma And Other Psychological /Mental Health Challenges In The Coverage Of Pandemics And Crisis Situations\u201d , who said, both water and relaxation therapies were best tools for managing stress adding that they were cheap and without any side effects.\n\nDr. Israel, advised the participants to maintain healthy nutrition, relaxation , regular exercise (tailored to suit individuals) and sleep patterns especially when under pressure to meet deadlines; she added that trauma experienced during reporting has a tendency to overwhelm journalists\u2019 ability to cope with work and life.\n\nAccording to her, COVID-19 has challenged existing models of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which are by-products of past events, adding that research has shown that people now exhibit stress symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and urged participants to always have positive attitude about life.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Cutrupi Gillo, of IFEX, while speaking on the topic \u201cSafety Reporting Challenges Offline and Online\u201d, reminded journalists that security of their devices and optimal confidentiality is key to safe practice of the profession.\n\nMr. Gillo , a security expert, emphasized the need to ensure that devices as well as apps are locked while introducing new softwares that are safer for Information storage apart from the regular ones and urged participants to always conduct regular checklists and also secure their electronic mails for future purposes.\n\nHe warned journalists against visiting unknown and unverified websites that could compromise their devices and data.\n\nThe Executuve Director of International Press Centre (IPC), Mr. Lanre Ogundade while welcoming participants to the training, said that, the training was one of the components of a project on \u2018Enhanced Safety Awareness for Nigeria Journalists\u2019 being implemented by IPC with the support of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of organisations that promote and defend the right to freedom of expression and information.\n\nHe explained that IFEX also supports the building of appropriate capacities for journalists including safety in investigative reporting, digital security and management of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nMr. Arogundade highlighted that the training was expected to enhance the reporters capacity to manage difficult safety challenges while carrying out their assignments. He enjoined all participants to practice with increased confidence and manage dangerous situations effectively.\n\n\u201cThis workshop is expected to enhance capacity to manage difficult safety challenges while carrying out our work. Participating journalists are expected to be able to practice with increased confidence and manage dangerous situations .\n\n\u201cwhen the media is constantly attacked and intimidated, the society suffers information scarcity. Government, civil society, businesses, and individuals all loose when the media cannot do it\u2019s job of bringing reliable information to the public.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, the training became imperative because the importance of journalists\u2019 safety cannot be over emphasized, especially since journalists have to face the challenge of publicising information in a new and challenging but repressive environment, despite being poorly equipped and in some cases having limited knowledge and skills.\n\nThe over 50 participant were drawn from the print, broadcast, online journalists,and bloggers among whom were journalists assaulted or harassed in different ways in the course of covering the current Covid -19 pandemic in the southern States of Nigeria.\n\n...",

          "text": ". He is an agent provocateur, working for extraneous interests \u2013 Govs\n\nGovernors of the 17 Southern states in the country have lambasted the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, for qestioning the legality of their recent ban on open grazing.\n\nReacting on behalf of the governors, the Chairman of the South West Governors Forum, Rotimi Akeredolu, warned Shehu and his paymasters that no inch of the space delineated and currently known as South West, and indeed the whole South, would be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\n\nAkeredolu accused Garba Shehu of working assiduously for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement tittled: \u201cMr Garba Shehu; On the Trail of An Agent Provocateur\u201d signed by his Senior Special Adviser on Special Duties and Strategy, Dr Doyin Odebowale, Akeredolu said \u201cMr Garba must disclose, this day, the real motive(s) of those he serves, definitely not the President.\n\n\u201cHe cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus, and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity. The easy recourse to mendacious uppity in pushing a barely disguised pernicious agendum is well understood.\n\n\u201cThe declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u201clasting solutions\u201d which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge.\n\n\u201cMr Garba Shehu just released a press statement purporting to represent the position of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, on the farmer-herder \u201cclashes\u201d and what he termed as \u2018Deep Rooted Solutions to the herdsmen attacks\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe also attributed a unilateral decision to the President who \u201cclears the way for ranching and revival of forest reserves\u201d as part of the \u201cpermanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u2018killer-herdsmen\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has been following the utterances of this man, as well as his fellow travelers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy cannot but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr Garba contends that their announcement is of questionable legality\u201d, referring to the 17 Governors of the Southern States, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u201cgun-wielding\u201d \u201ckiller herdsmen\u201d and their families, and provide \u201cveterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u201d for which \u201cthe Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u201d, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism.\n\n\u201cHe wants to \u201crevive forest reserves\u201d but seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law, that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed. Governors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories.\n\n\u201cThey must take instructions from appointees of the Federal Government on such matters.\n\n\u201clt is superfluous, and that is being charitable, for anyone to remind us of the constitutional right of bona fide citizens to enjoy rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 States (and FCT)-regardless of their state of birth and residence\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has never been any contention on this provision. It is clear that Mr Garba seems to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under our law.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiety and mischief.\n\n\u201cMost traditional families in Nigeria have occupations. Pastoralism is not an exception. Any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism may be assisted to embrace modernity.\n\n\u201cDispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u201cside-by-side\u201d with other communities cannot be for the purpose of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cIt raises suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent, and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land. Mr Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land.\n\n\u201cMay we warn Mr Garba Shehu and his cohorts to desist from hurling insults at the elected representatives of the people.\n\n\u201cHe lacks the authority to make policy statements for the Federal Government, unless directed, expressly. His acts are clearly those of an agent provocateur. Other closet dreamers, aspirers to colonial fantasies, must be weaned off their delusion,\u201d Akeredolu insisted.",

I did farming for 32 years to support my teaching job, just to ensure that my children have the best of education.\n\n\u201cSince my retirement in 2019, Taiwo has been the one sustaining my family.

          "text": "The prohibition on open grazing enacted by the Southern Governors has been chastised by the White House. The Southern Governors allegedly attempted to impose a moratorium on open grazing to display their dominance, according to the report.\n\nOn Monday, Garba Shehu, a senior special assistant to the President on media and publicity, issued a statement to that effect. President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Shehu said, has indicated a strong commitment to resolving herder conflicts, as well as the problem of gun-wielding \u201ckilling herdsmen.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cPresident had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture, in a report he submitted and the President signed off on back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum, which attempted to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that their resolutions did not provide a solution to the herder-farmer conflicts that have raged in our nation for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, inhabitants of the southern states \u2013 indeed, people of all Nigerian states \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find solutions to governance and human rights concerns, rather than to wash their hands of difficult decisions by issuing prohibitions that declare, \u201cNot in my state.\u201d\n\nMr Shehu further stated that their announcement is problematic in legal terms.\n\nHe underlined the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms in each of our 36 states (and the Federal Capital Territory), regardless of where they were born or live.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever purpose it is intended, and Mr. President, who has rightly been concerned about these issues more than any other citizen, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, beginning with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant, in consultation with farmers and herders alike.\n\nWith veterinary clinics, animal watering stations, and schools for herders and their families, the Federal Government is bringing far-reaching and practical changes to these rehabilitated areas, allowing various populations to coexist side by side: assisting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their cattle, and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the financial hardship the COVID-19 pandemic has had on both the federal and state governments. Nonetheless, given the critical need to solve the persistent problems, federal financing for the long-delayed project is now being partially freed. In a few of the agreeing states, work on fully implementing the current reserve system should begin in June.\u201d\n\nNEWS DIRECT recalls that seventeen governors from the country\u2019s southern area gathered in Asaba, Delta state, two weeks ago.\n\nA ban on open-grazing of cattle and the need for ranching are among the state governors\u2019 resolutions. The Governors also discussed the urgent necessity for reorganization in order to achieve parity with other areas.\n\nHowever, the meeting\u2019s statement has sparked arguments about whether the restriction is lawful or not.",

          "text": "Military officers in Mali detained the president, prime minister and defence minister of the interim government on Monday, deepening political chaos just months after a military coup ousted the previous president, multiple sources told Reuters.\n\nPresident Bah Ndaw, Prime Minister Moctar Ouane and defence minister Souleymane Doucoure were all taken to a military base in Kati outside the capital Bamako, hours after two members of the military lost their positions in a government reshuffle, the diplomatic and government sources said.\n\nTheir detentions followed the military ouster in August of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. The development could exacerbate instability in the West African country where violent Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State control large areas of the desert north.\n\nPolitical instability and military infighting have complicated efforts by Western powers and neighbouring countries to prop up to the impoverished nation, contributing to regional insecurity.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 mission in Mali called for the group\u2019s \u201cimmediate and unconditional\u201d release and said those who hold the leaders would have to answer for their actions.\n\nA delegation from the top regional decision-making body ECOWAS will visit Bamako on Tuesday to help resolve the \u201cattempted coup\u201d, ECOWAS, the U.N., African Union, European Union and several European countries said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThe international community rejects in advance any act imposed by coercion, including forced resignations,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called in a statement for the \u201cunconditional release of those currently being held\u201d.\n\nNdaw and Ouane had been tasked with overseeing an 18-month transition back to civilian rule after the August takeover, but they appear to have moved against the military\u2019s control over a number of key positions.\n\n\u201cThe sacking of the pillars of the coup was an enormous misjudgement,\u201d a senior former Malian government official told Reuters. \u201cThe actions are probably aimed at getting them back in their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe military\u2019s ultimate goal was not immediately clear. One military official in Kati said this was not an arrest. \u201cWhat they have done is not good,\u201d the source said, referring to the cabinet reshuffle. \u201cWe are letting them know, decisions will be made.\u201d\n\nKati\u2019s military base is notorious for ending the rule of Malian leaders. Last August, the military took President Keita to Kati and forced him to resign. A mutiny there helped topple his predecessor Amadou Toumani Toure in 2012.\n\nMali has been in turmoil ever since. Toure\u2019s departure triggered an ethnic Tuareg rebellion to seize the northern two-thirds of the country, which was hijacked by al Qaeda-linked jihadists.\n\nFrench forces beat the insurgents back in 2013 but they have since regrouped and carry out regular attacks on the army and civilians. They have exported their methods to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger where attacks have skyrocketed since 2017.\n\nThere had appeared to be some cause for optimism. The transitional government said last month that it would hold legislative and presidential elections in Feb. 2022 to restore a democratic government.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable, but not surprising: the arrangement agreed to after the coup last year was not perfect, but it was a compromise agreed to by all the major Malian and international stakeholders,\u201d said J. Peter Pham, former U.S. special envoy for the Sahel, now with the Atlantic Council, told Reuters.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

Does it not violate the respective rights of the Fulani and Ibo people if you restrict their rights to movement of their possessed goods that are not legally outlawed?\n\n\u201dFulanis own cattle which they move around in possessive sense. Spare part dealers move spare parts in ownership and possessive sense. We submit that it is the encroachment of the right of others that has ever been punishable and not the act of lawful grazing. Identifying encroachment with an ethnic toga is dangerous and mischievous and it has ever been. A spare parts dealer that encroaches into other peoples land to store his wares has committed an act of trespass not because he is an Igbo man but because of his unlawful act.\n\n\u201dAs AGF, his role is to set out the law in precise terms and if we must understand, he is not the one that made these laws because it is not his duty to do so.\n\n\u201dWe also make bold to say that the Southern Governors\u2019 declaration is a blanket statement lacking in precision and legally wrong. The statement of the AGF in the interview was aimed at showing this.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law. We believe it is wrong from for the Southern Governors to throw a blanket ban because criminals have infiltrated a business. It is illogical to act in that regard and we urge the Governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dAt this stage of our national life when tackling insecurity is at the front burner of governance, the Governors should not distract citizens with the issue of open grazing. They should rather focus their energy on granting autonomy to States Legislature, Judiciary and Local Governments . By this we mean that the Governors should immediately implement the provisions of Executive Order 10 as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. They should respect the democratic principles of independence of State Legislature and Judiciary in line with Section 121 (3) of the Constitution. Nigerians seek nothing less. The divisionary and diversionary techniques should be over.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja called on the international community to support Chad to conclude the transition from military to democratic government in a peaceful manner within the set time of 18 months.\n\nPresident Buhari spoke at the opening of the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) convened to discuss the recent developments in Chad after President Idris Deby Itno died on the frontline while defending the territorial integrity of his country.\n\nThe Nigerian leader, who declared the one-day summit open in his capacity as the Chair of leaders of LCBC member-countries, rallied development partners and countries particularly France, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Russia; the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union, as well as other friendly and partner nations to support the transition framework put in place by Chad\u2019s Transition Military Council led by General Mahamat Idris Deby.\n\n\u2018\u2018The need to support the Chadian government to effectively carry out its planned 18-month transition is sacrosanct.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, it must be stated that the sanctity of the Chadian constitution as the supreme guiding document defining the social contract in the country must be respected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018The transition period should be civilian-led, with requisite powers given to the constitutionally mandated organs of government saddled with the responsibility of administering the country,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari said.\n\n#HappeningNow: Arrival of the Heads of Government to the Extraordinary meeting of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. pic.twitter.com/NtVmesxzGT \u2014 TVC News (@tvcnewsng) May 25, 2021\n\n\n\nAt the in-person meeting attended by the Presidents of Central African Republic, Niger, Chad, Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya and a representative of the President of Cameroon, President Buhari said the death of President Deby Itno had direct implications for the continued peace and stability of Chad as a nation, the Lake Chad region and the wider Sahel Region.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our region is faced with difficult, several challenges that need the support and engagement of all to overcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018While transnational crimes and rebellion cutting across our region continue to evolve in scope, the attendant conflicts also continue to retain their distinct form of inflicting untold hardship and difficulty on the lives of our citizens.\n\n\u2018\u2018The threats by the Chadian rebel groups, who are clamouring to overthrow the government, must be viewed with all the seriousness they deserve because the consequences of a destabilized Chad to the sub-region cannot be imagined.\n\n\u2018\u2018The flow of refugees and displaced persons from the country, unrestrained flow of arms, drugs and other harmful substances into Lake Chad and Sahel Regions, which are already challenged by terrorists seeking to establish parallel systems, would further compound the security and stability of our areas and neighbouring countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is, therefore, our collective duty and in honour of the memory of the men and women that have died in search of peace in the region, to rise in unison as leaders of the region to ensure that peace, stability and security are not disrupted in Chad and in the entire region.\n\n\u2018\u2018These challenges, which are fuelled by an interplay of poverty and the loss of sustainable means of livelihood due to climate change, have been further exacerbated by the direct consequence of complete breakdown of law and order in Libya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018The Libyan conflict has increased fragility in our region with debilitating security implications across the Lake Chad and the larger Sahel Region, typified by increased circulation of illicit arms and ammunition, narcotic substances as well as a refugee crisis that continues to threaten the security of the region,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nUrging fellow leaders not to relent in their efforts and allow the enemies of the region to succeed in their quest to destabilize the area, President Buhari said:\n\n\u2018\u2018We must reinvigorate our collective will and commitment towards eradicating terrorism and entrenching democratic rule and good governance in Chad and in our region.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must remain focussed and true to ensuring sustainable development of the region.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Buhari also used the occasion to commend the untiring efforts of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Multinational Joint Task Force, member countries\u2019 National Armed Forces and Security and Intelligence Agencies \u2018\u2018who daily strive to ensure the complete restoration of peace and stability in the region.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe pledged that officers, some of whom have paid the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty for the survival of the region, will never be forgotten.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are committed to ensuring that the ideals of restoring peace, stability and viability of the Lake Chad Region to its glorious state to which some of you have paid the ultimate price, is achieved,\u2019\u2019 he declared.\n\nOn the request of President Buhari and in recognition of the immense and sterling contributions of the late President of Chad to peace and stability in the region, the Summit observed a minute silence for the departed leader.\n\nEulogising the Marshal of Chad, President Buhari described the late President as a committed African leader and statesman who stood for peace and stability of the Lake Chad Region, the Sahel and the African continent in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018His passion, commitment and zeal to the cause of the Lake Chad and African unity would be greatly missed,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "Tens of thousands of people in low-lying areas of two Indian states have been evacuated and moved to cyclone shelters to escape a powerful storm barreling toward the eastern coast.\n\nCyclone Yaas is set to turn into a \u201cvery severe cyclonic storm\u201d with sustained wind speeds of up to 177 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour), the India Meteorological Department said. The cyclone is expected to make landfall early Wednesday in Odisha and West Bengal states.\n\nThe cyclone is coming amid a devastating coronavirus surge complicates India\u2019s efforts to deal with both just 10 days after Cyclone Tauktae hit India\u2019s west coast and killed more than 140 people.\n\nThousands of emergency personnel have been deployed in coastal regions of the two states for evacuation and any possible rescue operations, said S.N. Pradhan, director of India\u2019s National Disaster Response Force. India\u2019s air force and navy were also on standby to carry out relief work.\n\nFishing trawlers and boats have been told to take shelter until further notice as forecasters warned of high tidal waves.\n\nIn West Bengal, authorities were scrambling to move tens of thousands of people to cyclone shelters. Officials said at least 20 districts in the state will feel the brunt of the storm.\n\nLast May, nearly 100 people died in Cyclone Amphan, the most powerful storm in more than a decade to hit eastern India, including West Bengal state. It flattened villages, destroyed farms and left millions without power in eastern India and Bangladesh.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to fix the damage to our home from the last cyclone. Now another cyclone is coming, how will we stay here?\u201d said Samitri, who uses only one name.\n\nIn Odisha, a state already battered by coronavirus infections, authorities evacuated nearly 15,000 people living along the coast and moved them to cyclone shelters, senior officer Pradeep Jena said.\n\nIn a televised address Monday, the state\u2019s chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, appealed to people being moved to cyclone shelters to wear double masks and maintain social distancing. He asked authorities to distribute masks to the evacuated people.\n\n\u201cWe have to face both the challenges simultaneously,\u201d Patnaik said.",

          "text": "It\u2019s been a year since George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, sparking global protests. Supporters, activists and his family will honor Floyd with a series of celebrations of his life and marches Tuesday.\n\nFrom Dallas to Washington, DC, to Minneapolis, Floyd\u2019s name will echo across the country in recognition of a man who has become a symbol in the fight for racial equality and police reform.\n\nFloyd\u2019s sister Bridgett Floyd, his daughter Gianna Floyd and Gianna\u2019s mother, Roxie Washington, will visit the White House at the invitation of President Joe Biden. The family meeting will be private so Biden can have a \u201creal conversation and preserve that with the family,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said.\n\n\u201cHe has a genuine relationship with them, and the courage and grace of this family and especially his daughter Gianna Floyd, has really stuck with the President \u2026\u201d Psaki said. \u201cSo, he\u2019s eager to listen to their perspectives and hear what they have to say.\u201d\n\nThe family visit will come as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act remains stalled in the Senate, despite Biden setting an initial goal of having the legislation passed by Tuesday. The bill includes provisions to set up a national registry of police misconduct, a ban on racial and religious profiling by law enforcement and an overhaul of qualified immunity for police officers.\n\nOther members of Floyd\u2019s family are expected to attend memorial events in Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a family spokesman. One of those events is a \u201cCelebration of Life\u201d which includes a day of games, food, inflatable attractions for youth and special performances by Grammy Award-winning artists and local talent.\n\nElsewhere, organizers in Dallas are hosting a solidarity march and rally and the California-based Pacific Symphony is streaming a free concert in honor of Floyd.\n\n\u201cclose dialog\u201d\n\nBET will also pay homage to Floyd, airing special programming that kicks off Tuesday with \u201cBars and Ballads for George Floyd,\u201d featuring Jon Batiste, Nas, former UN Ambassador Andrew Young, singer and activist Anthony Hamilton and Color of Change President Rashad Robinson.\n\nSeveral other events honoring Floyd have been held in recent days. Bridgett Floyd spoke during a rally Sunday in Minneapolis where she vowed to be a voice for George Floyd and advocate for change. She was joined by civil rights attorney Ben Crump and Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\n\u201cIt has been a long year. It has been a painful year,\u201d Bridgett Floyd told the crowd on Sunday. \u201cIt has been very frustrating for me and my family. For your life to change within a blink of an eye. I still don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nThe George Floyd Memorial Foundation is also asking supporters to honor the anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death by joining its mission of ending systemic violence against Black Americans.\n\nThe foundation has urged supporters to use Tuesday to call their elected officials \u2014 particularly their senators \u2014 and demand that they pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act; register to vote; help promote the foundation\u2019s work on social media and donate to the foundation\u2019s programs that support the Black community.",

Far more important, the issues distilled bordered on the Southern governors\u2019 Asaba Declaration.\n\n\u201cHowever, a slight mix-up and communication gap had caused his unintended absence even as an earlier engagement had been fixed for Ibadan weeks before the meeting.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, the resolutions reached by the revered leaders at the Lagos meeting are quite commendable and timely. The issues discussed are germane and are clear indications that men of goodwill are working together to solve the nation\u2019s current challenges.\n\n\u201cAs one of the leaders of the APC in the South-west, and more so that, he presided over the Asaba meeting of the Southern governors, nothing could be more spirit-lifting than the outcome of the Lagos meeting on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe, therefore, endorses all the resolutions reached by the leaders who attended the meeting.\u201d\n\nFayemi stated that he had apologised for not attending the meeting.\n\nFayemi said he supported the resolutions of the leaders, clarifying that his absence from the meeting was as a result of a mix-up in the invitation sent out for the meeting.\n\nFayemi, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, said: \u201cFor clarity, the invitation for the meeting, which was said to have been sent via WhatsApp by Mr. Tunde Rahman, an aide to Senator Bola Tinubu, never got to Governor Fayemi.\n\n\u201cThe absence of an invitation for the South-west APC leaders meeting prevented the governor from attending the meeting, as he was not aware.\n\n\u201cGovernor Fayemi, however, sent an apology to the meeting through former Ekiti State Governor and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investments, Chief Niyi Adebayo; as he was already scheduled to attend another engagement at the time he came to learn of the meeting.\u201d\n\nHe said as a true democrat, he was in total support of the decisions reached by the South-west leaders at the meeting.\n\n\u201cThese decisions included an endorsement of the positions earlier adopted by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum on the ban on open grazing and the need for true federalism, among others,\u201d he said.\n\nJames Sowole in Akure and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",
