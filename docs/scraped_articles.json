          "text": "\u2026calls for release of Kanu , other political prisoners unconditionally\n\nThe Igbo World Assembly, the umbrella organization of Ndiigbo in the Diaspora after an emergency by its country leaders held at the weekend has cautioned the Federal Government against the use of force to stop the Nigerian indigenous ethnic groups from agitation for self-determination.\n\nThe group during the meeting having reviewed the abduction of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in a foreign land and his detention in Nigeria has called for release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and other political prisoners unconditionally, allowing Nigerians to decide their fate while the government focuses on addressing massive insecurity, unemployment, hunger, poverty and other challenges.\n\nAccordingly., the group in a communique signed its Chairman, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze noted that Nigeria can only be saved in one form or the other, devoid of the current structure and 1999 constitution; through a negotiation that allows Nigerians to express their will and discuss their peaceful co-existence based on equity, respect and fairness and discuss their peaceful co-existence based on equity, respect and fairness.\n\nThe group in the communique after considering carefully the high rate of insecurity in Nigeria, massive agitation from all parts of Nigeria; ongoing killing, rapping and destruction of farms and properties by Fulani Cattle Herdsmen/Miyetti Allah, among other issues noted that there was need for dialogue and negotiation, adding that .\u201dWe need a serious dialogue among all the ethnic nationalities for Nigeria to continue its existence\u201d.\n\nAnakwenze in the communique stated that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu must be released immediately and unconditionally as his further detention is unacceptable. \u201cThe current situation whereby Southern Nigerians agitating for a free homeland are killed, arrested and detained, while Cattle Herdsmen/Miyetti Allah that kill our people and rape our women are protected can no longer be tolerated. That the abduction of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu cannot silence or end the agitation as the root cause for agitation remains unattended i.e., allowing the Nigerian people to decide their fate or live-in freedom.\n\nIWA while affirming their commitment to the unity of Nigeria on the pillars of equity, fairness, justice, progress and peaceful co-existence between and amongst its people through a national dialogue in the communique further noted that, \u201cThe very existence of the IPOB, Sunday Igboho\u2019s group and many other such group is a response to the present Nigerian administration treatment of Nigerian indigenous ethnic groups. The Federal Government can use brutal force to arrest individuals but cannot arrest the people\u2019s agitation, and the will of the people cannot be arrested and suppressed by force however, negotiation could bring lasting solution.\n\n\u201cIt not a crime for anyone or group to express intention to leave any country peacefully and be on their own homeland without intending to occupy others. The Federal Government of Nigeria should negotiate with Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and other Southern Nigerian and Middle Belt Nigerian stakeholders on how to allow Nigerians to decide what type of country they want to be in\u201d\n\nThe Diaspora group cautioned that failing to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and other political prisoners regardless of their ethnicity was nothing but declaring war on the Nigerian indigenous ethnic groups especially those in the Southern and Middle belt of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd any harm to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu may lead to unintended consequences to the corporate existence of Nigeria. While not all the Igbos or all Southerners are members of IPOB, we are all members of Nigerian Indigenous Ethnic Groups who feel the same pain.\n\n\u201d IWA wishes to emphasize, that under the circumstances, the unambiguously acceptable solution and path is one predicated on the restructuring of Nigeria with a new federal constitution or separation. Any of the path is fair to all and established without prejudice to any of the Nigerian Indigenous Ethnic Groups. It is the common meeting locus at which any entity working for the dignified identity, survival and progress of the Nigerian people will arrive. Nigerians do not need to be like Rwanda before findings a lasting solution\u201d, the group added.\n\nWhile calling on the Federal Government of Nigeria, State Government, Nigerian Indigenous Ethnic Groups, International Community and Nigerians at home and abroad to courageously do everything possible to bring all stakeholders to the negotiation table, the group believed that Nigeria needs to undertake and promote high-level ethno-political consultations, negotiations, dialogues, peace talks and other consensus-building strategic meetings, designed to serve, as result-oriented channels for nurturing Nigeria\u2019s unity, peace, political stability and ethno-regional integration\n\nThe group advised the Federal Government that failure to embrace restructuring with a new federal constitution tied to true federalism is leading various sections of Nigeria to go their separate ways or seek self-determination.\n\n\u201cThe use of force to settle differences may force the Nigerian Indigenous Ethnic Groups to go their separate ways. Neglecting the challenges and resorting to the use of force and coercion to stop Nigerian Indigenous Ethnic Groups from agitation for self-determination may lead the Nigerian Indigenous Ethnic Groups to jointly request for other options. We need a serious dialogue among all the ethnic nationalities for Nigeria to continue its existence\u201d, the group added.\n\nThe AK47 carrying Cattle Herdsmen, according to IWA should be declared terrorists, adding that the federal government must as a matter of urgency, demonstrate leadership and thread the path to restore security, normalcy, and freedom of expression in Nigeria.\n\nWhile applauding and agreeing with the Communique issued by the Southern Governors after their Lagos meeting dated July 5th, 2021, the group added that, \u201cThe Nigerian Government has not been able to establish a proof of IPOB killing of innocent citizens compared to number of people killed by Fulani Cattle Herdsmen/Miyetti Allah and why is IPOB deemed a terrorist group and Cattle Herdsmen/Miyetti Allah not so considered.",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Monday, said nobody has been appointed to succeed its leader, Nnamdi Kanu in operating Radio Biafra.\n\nIPOB made the remark while noting that Simon Ekpa is not Kanu\u2019s successor on Radio Biafra.\n\nThe group\u2019s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful explained that Ekpa was appointed as one of Radio Biafra\u2019s broadcasters.\n\nKanu was reported to have appointed Ekpa as Radio Biafra\u2019s interim leader but Powerful in a statement said Ekpa was appointed as a reporter on IPOB\u2019s platform.\n\nHe assured that Kanu will soon be free to continue his agitation.\n\nAccording to Powerful: \u201cIPOB ably led by our indomitable leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to confirm the directive by our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, that Mazi Simon Ekpa, an illustrious son of Biafra be included among the broadcasters on the Radio Biafra platform.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, wish to also debunk the fake information and falsehood making the rounds that Mazi Simon Ekpa had been appointed to take over Radio Biafra or the Interim Leader of IPOB.\n\n\u201cMazi Simon Ekpa is only one of the many broadcasters on Radio Biafra whose immense contributions to the struggle are recognised. Nobody has been appointed to take over from our leader because he will soon be out to continue with the liberation movement.\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate that IPOB is a united, formidable and well-structured family that even in the absence of our Leader the operations of our movement runs effortlessly on a well-established structure. The Directorate of State, (DOS) is fully in charge of the affairs in IPOB worldwide and therefore no vacuum exists concerning the day to day running of this great movement.\n\n\u201cWe know that confucionists and the enemies of our struggle are looking for an opportunity to instigate disaffection and create a crisis in IPOB especially now that our Leader is in detention but there plan is dead on arrival. We, therefore, wish to urge the wonderful IPOB family worldwide as well as the general public to disregard any other information to the contrary. Importantly too, any information purportedly coming from IPOB that does not pass through our normal channel of information dissemination should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cWhile various contributions of members of IPOB and other Biafrans towards our liberation at this critical moment of our struggle are appreciated, we wish to make it clear that responsibilities are given to people solely for the service of the Biafran people. Biafrans should be rest assured that the leadership of this movement put together by our leader Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will not allow anyone to sow seeds of confusion in the minds of our people. Biafrans must be alert because the enemy is trying to play the same card they played in 2015 when Onyendu was in the custody of the Nigerian government. The IPOB worldwide family defeated them then and we shall also defeat them together with their co-travellers this time around.\n\n\u201cWe urge all Biafrans to continue to maintain absolute discipline and remain resolute in our march towards the restoration of our Nation Biafra. The night is far spent and the morning is almost here. We are already at the threshold of our independence. We can\u2019t be distracted and we can not lose focus at this moment.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nAfenifere, pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, has raised the alarm that Nigeria is at the brink of an avoidable catastrophe that requires urgent actions.\n\nIt called for immediate passing of state policing Act to save Nigeria from imminent apostrophe, insisting that governors would become true chief security officers only when they have a security outfit that takes orders from them.\n\nThe group made the calls in a communique after an emergency executive meeting at the residence of its leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the body, Jare Ajayi, in a statement in Ibadan yesterday, stated that the most potent recipe to prevent the catastrophe is restructuring that would return the country to true federalism.\n\nAt the meeting, Afenifere reviewed recent developments in the country and concluded that \u201cthe signs are ominous, requiring steps to prevent the country from apocalypse.\u201d\n\nIt indicated that the meeting endorsed the recent resolutions of the governors of southern Nigeria with regards to placing a total ban on open grazing and having state police.\n\n\u201cAfenifere is in full support of the governors to have laws banning open grazing latest by September 1, this year. We notice that some states already have this law enacted. We urge the remaining states to enact the law expeditiously. Beyond the enactment, however, we call for immediate enforcement of the law so as to put an end to various vices that the act of open grazing is engendering.\u201d\n\nIt frowned at the disapproval being expressed by some northern elements to the position of southern governors, prompting it to ask the questions: \u201cOf what intrinsic benefits has open grazing been in the recent past going by various studies that have been done?\n\n\u201cIt is on record, for instance, that open grazing is one of the major causes of desertification that is occurring in the northern part of the country. It is also on record that cows reared in a ranch are far more productive, healthier and are less tasking for the rearer compared to the ones being driven from one place to another in search of food and water. And certainly, those in ranches constitute less risk to neighbouring communities compared to the ones migrating from one place to another.\u201d\n\nAfenifere maintained that the seeming intractable security challenges were due largely to the restraint put in the way of state governors.\n\n\u201cThe governors are described as chief security officers of their respective states, yet they have no security agency that can be deployed to where crimes are being committed with arms; a security agency that can arrest, investigate and prosecute. Those of them who came up with some security apparatus like Amotekun are disempowered because they could not bear arms. And when they arrest suspected criminals, such suspects must be handed over to the police.\n\n\u201cAs experiences have shown, once this is done, hardly do such cases go beyond the police. And the state security body has no control anymore since the police is a federal agency, who does not take order from the governor. This must change. State police, down to the level of local government, must become operational immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere executive council also called on President Muhammadu Buhari, the national and state assemblies and all other concerned authorities to ensure that restructuring takes place before end of the year.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

If we allow the opposition to have their way, it means that before the election in 2023, we have conceded defeat.\n\n\u201cFor party interest, we are mobilised to ensure that the clauses of electronic voting and transmission of results are defeated \u2013 at least, for now.\n\n\u201cThe draft bill will be tabled on Tuesday and the debate clause-by-clause will commence on Wednesday up to Thursday; thereafter, we proceed on Sallah break.\u201d\n\nBut those opposed to the removal of the clauses are also preparing a counter move.\n\nA source from the opposition political parties told THISDAY that there would be no voice votes when a serious decision on the clauses is to be taken.\n\n\u201cWe have provisions in the Senate rules for voice votes as well as dividing the Senate for the purpose of taking crucial debates.\n\n\u201cUnder the circumstances, we shall call for division because it is in our rules, or we take electronic voting; they are all in our rules. But the voice votes may not be allowed to prevail in issues like this,\u201d the senator said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Consultative Front (NcFront) has called on stakeholders across party lines, civil society groups, labour unions, youths and women groups to unite against the thickening plot and conspiracy against the amendment bill.\n\nIn a statement by the spokesman of the National Consultative Forum, Dr. Tanko Yunusa, the group said the plot against the electoral reforms draft was by a few politicians in power, who wanted to circumvent and supplant the popular will and yearnings of Nigerians for an improved electoral system.\n\nHe stated that the group has commenced a nationwide mobilisation of concerned leaders and stakeholders, including former and intending presidential candidates, party and political leaders, labour and civil society activists, among others, to meet and demand acceptable amendments to the Electoral Act, with the aim of improving Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nNCfront said it was reaching out and rallying stakeholders, eminent Nigerians, including religious leaders, leaders of youths, women and vulnerable persons\u2019 groups behind stopping the national emergency threatening the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe group urged all concerned Nigerians and political stakeholders, irrespective of divide and affinity, to come together to demand a formidable, inclusive, improved and sustainable electoral law that can build the trust and confidence of Nigerians in the electoral system on future elections, starting from the 2023 election cycle.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NNPC Records $1.2bn Shortfall in Priority Projects Funding",
          "text": "*PIB: Senate restricts petroleum products importation to refinery owners\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recorded a total shortfall of $1.2 billion in the financing of its priority projects between January and May 2021, latest data from the national oil company has shown.\n\nThis is coming as the Senate\u2019s decision to award three per cent to oil-bearing communities may not be the only controversial clause in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nThe Senate in the recently passed PIB, has also restricted the importation of all petroleum products into the country to only players that have local refining capacity.\n\nThe NNPC document showed that the entire appropriation for \u2018calendarised\u2019 cost recovery and funding for priority projects was $6.43 billion, which was further segmented into $536 million monthly.\n\nAccording to the corporation, of the $2.680 billion that was supposed to be released for the projects as of May this year, only $1.468 billion financing had been made available, leaving a deficit of $1.211 billion.\n\nIn terms of actual functional dollar funding level, a breakdown of the releases showed that in January, $276.4 million was spent on cost recovery and ongoing projects, in February it was $252.9 million, while it was $307.65 million in March.\n\nIn the same vein, for April, out of the monthly appropriation of $536 million, $239.2 million was spent, while in May, it increased to $392 million, the highest in the period under consideration.\n\nThe corporation listed the federally funded upstream projects as gas infrastructure development, Brass LNG, crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses, frontier exploration services as well as the Excravos Gas-to-Liquid (EGTL) operating expenses.\n\nHowever, it noted that the funding excluded pipelines security and maintenance, which gulped N2.263 billion in May alone.\n\nTHISDAY had earlier exclusively reported that the corporation had resumed the monthly funding for its frontier exploration services which did not receive any budget in April, but gulped N3.216 billion in May, having received N1.964 billion in January, N1.920 billion in February, and N2.255 billion in March.\n\nAdded to that, in May, the gas infrastructure development was funded to the tune of N3.919 billion and the crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses was N659 million.\n\nIn the month under review, funding for renewables was N196 million, while the Nigeria-Morocco pipeline which was not funded in April, received attention to the tune of N8.33 million in May.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate in the PIB has restricted petroleum products importation to only operators who own and run local refineries.\n\nThe joint PIB harmonisation committee of the National Assembly is expected to meet from today to address some of the controversies generated by the bill, chief among them are the three per cent of the operating expenditure of oil companies that should go to the host communities and the 30 per cent NNPC\u2019s profit designated for exploration in frontier basins.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that while the PIB expectedly removed price controls on petroleum products in section 205, the Senate version of the bill has a clause that constrains market competition by restricting the importation of products to only players with local refining capacity.\n\nThe controversial provision in the Senate\u2019s version contained in Section 317(8) of the PIB, clearly counters the provision of 205(1) of the bill, which states thus: \u201cSubject to the provisions of this section, from the effective date, wholesale and retail prices of petroleum products shall be based on an unrestricted free market pricing conditions.\u201d\n\nThe inserted section 317(8) in the Senate bill stated that the authority, that is, the new agency to oversee the activities of downstream and midstream sectors of the oil and gas industry shall apply the Backward Integration Policy in the downstream petroleum sector to encourage investment in local refining.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version also stated that, to support the provision above, licence to import any product shortfalls shall be assigned only to companies with active local refining licences.\n\nThe upper legislative chamber also stated that import volume to be allocated between participants based on their respective production in the preceding quarter, and that such import to be done under the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited Direct Sale/Direct Purchase (DSDP) scheme.\n\nThe Senate further in its own version of the PIB, equally stipulated that, to safeguard the health of Nigerians, imported petroleum products shall conform to the Afri-5 specification (50ppm sulphur) as per the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) declaration of February 2020 on the adoption of the Afri-Fuels Roadmap.\n\nReacting to the controversial provision, an industry source, who pleaded anonymity, said such a provision in the Senate\u2019s version of the PIB, which restricted the importation of refined products to only players with local refining capacity would create a monopoly in a price deregulated environment and destroy the Nigerian downstream petroleum industry.\n\n\u201cThe provisions above will create a monopoly in a deregulated price environment thereby destroying the Nigerian downstream industry as we know it today. It restricts the importation of all petroleum products, including petrol, diesel, aviation fuel, lubricants, base oil \u2013 products that are already deregulated, to only players with local refining capacity,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe added that only the NNPC currently has domestic refining capacity for petrol and will be the only importer.\n\nHe maintained that such provision takes the industry back and could not have been the intention of the bill.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cMoving from a state-owned monopoly in a price regulated market to a duopoly in a price deregulated market is not what Nigeria needs now as it takes the industry backward and exposes Nigerians to exploitation and further hardship. This, in my humble view, is not reformatory.\n\n\u201cRather than seek to protect refiners, we should rather seek to protect the consumers by liberalising and expanding petroleum product supply sources. That is the only way prices will be \u201cmarket-determined\u201d and consumers made to pay fair value for the products they buy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

However, we do not support the use of any form of violence to redress the relative deprivation and prevailing inequality and injustice across the country,\u201d it said.\n\nThe organisation urged the youths to be law-abiding and sheathe their sword as the South-east leaders and stakeholders address collective grievances through meaningful dialogue and negotiations.\n\nOhanaeze also urged Ndigbo, particularly the youth, to actively participate in the ongoing voters\u2019 registration, as this is the only means to achieve their goals and aspirations in the Nigeria project.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Everybody should be allowed to import.\"\n\nHowever, the source, close to the workings of the Senate, asked the National assembly to consider allowing the downstream regulatory authority, which will be created when the bill comes into law, to create impartial regulations to guide any future importation of petrol.\n\n\"I think the provisions above will create a duopoly in a price deregulated environment, thereby destroying the Nigerian downstream industry as we know it today,\" the source said.\n\n\"The law and the authorities should protect the market (other players including Nigerian entrepreneurs) and the consumers rather than encourage monopoly/duopoly by locking out competition.\"\n\nDespite its potential move to eliminate competition and create a duopoly, Section 317 h. of the Senate PIB version commits to ending the sale of dirty fuel in Nigeria.\n\nThe fifth clause in the sections says;\n\n\"To safeguard the health of Nigerians, imported petroleum products shall conform to the Afri-5 specification (50ppm \u2013 particles per million sulfur) as per the ECOWAS declaration of February 2020 on the adoption of the Afri-Fuels Roadmap.\"\n\nRight now, Nigerians buy petrol that contains at least 3,000 sulfur ppm.",
          "summary": "If passed in its current form, the Senate version of the Petroleum Industry Bill will only permit two entities to import petroleum products into Nigeria: those who own active refining licenses and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited.\nThe law also provides for the continuation of the NNPC's Direct Sale Direct Purchase contract, which experts have questioned for being fraught with inconsistencies.\nHaving provided for the introduction of a free market in Section 205 a, the Senate version of the PIB goes ahead to contradict this stance in Section 317h.\nThe first subsection says, \"The Authority shall apply the Backward Integration Policy in the downstream petroleum sector to encourage investment in local refining.\"\nExperts feel modular refinery license holders are excluded from importing like the rest of the country with this clause.",

The federating units or regions are divided into the following geopolitical zones: North-West Zone, North-Eastern Zone, Middle \u2013 Belt Zone, South-East Zone, South-South Zone, South-West Zone and the Federal Capital Territory,\u201d the proposal reads.\n\n\u201cSection 3(6) be amended to provide for a number of local governments or such autonomous administrative units to be created by the respective federating units or states, the criteria of which shall include population, taxable capacity, ethnoreligious or other cultural and social affinities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 7 of the constitution be amended to include an additional (sub)section prohibiting the dissolution of elected local government councils.\n\n\u201cThis will be in compliance with the Supreme Court decisions in ALGON v. Oyo State Government; AG Plateau State & Others v. Goyol & Others; Governor, Ekiti State v. Olubunmo & Others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governors also proposed that section 8 (5) and (6) be removed so that local government creation will be the exclusive duty of state governors.\n\n\u201cSection 8(5) and (6) should be expunged. Section 8 (1) and (2) provides for the procedures for creation of state while Section 8(3), (4), (5) and (6) provides for the procedure for creation of local governments,\u201d the forum added.\n\n\u201cHowever, Section 8(5) and (6) should be expunged to make local government creation the exclusive duty of the state government.\u201d\n\nThe governors also sought the removal of section 29(4)(b), which confers adulthood status on a married under-18 woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSection 29(4)(a) and (b) contradict each other. While (a) says \u2018full age means the age of 18 years and above\u2019, (b) says \u2018any woman who is married shall be deemed to be full of age\u2019. This reinforces child marriage which negates the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 and the Child\u2019s Rights Act 2003, which outlaws child marriage.\u201d\n\nThe governors also want the states to be in charge of mineral resources within their territories.",

          "text": "JULY 11, 2021\n\nThis newsletter is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that will serve as a post-pandemic guide. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT. Hello, Let\u2019s talk about failure. In particular, fintech startup failures in Africa.\n\nThe subject of failures in Africa is often avoided maybe because it raises a sense of shame and disappointment. Failing at an endeavor after much effort can mean members of a founding team starting from scratch. Nobody likes that feeling (directly or otherwise from family or peers) that one\u2019s life has been a catastrophe or a waste of time at least.\n\nAs a recent report shows, more than one hundred fintech startups have failed in Africa in the last half decade. So does that mean a lot of African entrepreneurs have wasted productive years only to end up building nothing? On the contrary, we gain a lot by constructively documenting fintech failures in Africa.

The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive into the story. Fail forward The number of fintech startups in Africa has increased by nearly 90% between 2017 and 2021. That is according to Disrupt Africa\u2019s \u2018Finnovating for Africa\u2019 report on the state of fintech in Africa. Inspired by early movers like Andela and Paystack between 2014 and 2016, a generation of software developers, MBA types, former consultants and barely-twenty-year-olds who quit University has jumped into fintech-preneurship. And so the number of fintech startups in Africa has increased from 301 in 2017 to 491 in 2019 and 576 in 2021 (so far). You will find at least one fintech startup in 25 out of Africa\u2019s 54 countries. South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya (in that order) are the origin countries of 67.9% of fintechs on the continent, which is less than the 74.4% share they had in 2017, per Disrupt Africa. Olanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights The emergence of two fintech unicorns, Flutterwave and Chipper, this year paint the clearest picture yet of fintech\u2019s maturity and attraction in Africa. OPay, Paga and TeamApt are talking up their billion-dollar potentials too. But this fuzzy-rosy narrative should always be moderated by sober reflection. Because as many African fintechs rise, many also fall. One in five failures Out of the 301 fintech startups recorded in 2017, 72 had shut down by 2019. Out of the 491 startups recorded in 2019, 109 have closed as of today. What does that mean? It appears that at least 20% of the total fintech startups in Africa in a given year will close in two years. We need a longer list of startups over a longer period to make definitive predictions but keep this in mind for now. 59.6% of fintech startup closures between 2019 and 2021 happened in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. 40.3% of those startups were in either payments, remittances, lending or financing. According to the report\u2019s authors, the fintech startup shutdown rate (so far) can be blamed on \u201cunsustainable levels of competition in some sectors and geographies.\u201d Many startups crop up to pursue similar ideas and products. Some achieve traction, while others fall along the way. Of course that\u2019s not the whole story. Competition is a good thing. Startups that faded due to competition were not very effective in satisfying customer demand. In reality, sometimes fintech startups \u2013 like other businesses or organizations \u2013 fail because the founders make foundational mistakes. Like Abdulhamid Hassan (pictured at the top of this newsletter).\n\nWhen he founded OyaPay \u2013 a service for offline businesses to accept payment with or without a smartphone \u2013 in 2018, the startup was hailed a fintech startup to watch. But Hassan took seed money from an uncle who would not tolerate being diluted in a subsequent funding round. The result? Frustration and shutdown. But even founders who are able to raise money several times may not know what to do with the money. As reported by Quartz last week, we now know that the Angolan, Nigerian and Ghanaian founders behind KuBitX \u2013 a crypto exchange that packed up this year \u2013 were high on motivation but rather low on technical knowledge and administrative capacity. The end result? $1 million in VC money gone. Failures as seeds We are not deep-diving into these failures here. The point really is that it is necessary to see these public accounts, from the founders but also through investigative sources. One of KuBitX\u2019s founders admits to making \u201cearly-stage terrible mistakes.\u201d It could serve him well next time he joins or forms a startup. Hassan spent some time at Paystack as a product manager after OyaPay\u2019s demise, but has gone on to found Mono, a Y Combinator-backed fintech startup driving an open banking ecosystem in Nigeria. Where OyaPay lasted barely 365 days, Mono is being talked about as another Paystack. It\u2019ll be good to seek out those 181 startups that have failed in the past four years. Some of those founders and former employees have probably left fintech altogether for other causes. Maybe they\u2019ve left the uncertainty in Africa for more security in the US and Europe. But surely some have gone on to seed success in today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s African fintech unicorns. How do we get them to add nutrients from their failure stories to the ecosystem\u2019s startup soil? FROM THE CABAL Big bank brain drain Guaranty Trust Bank, one of Nigeria\u2019s biggest, has had issues. At the beginning of this year, many customers complained about not being able to complete transactions on the bank\u2019s USSD and mobile app channels. It recurred too often to be random or a temporary blip. So Daniel Adeyemi went a-digging. What he documents \u2013 overworked staff, mass exits, delayed promotions \u2013 is well worth your five minutes. Why did Peter Njonjo start Twiga in Kenya? In this exclusive interview, Edwin Madu sits with the Kenyan founder and has all you need to know We heard the bank accounts of Multichoice, the South African pay tv company, had been blocked in Nigeria.

          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, increased the popularity of mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The shortage in talent began compounding into increased workload and mounting pressure for remaining IT employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect the source\u2019s identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCBN\u2019s new regulations for Mobile Money services in Nigeria\n\nFlutterwave misses out on tax relief\n\nNigeria\u2019s young population and tech\n\nCBN releases new regulations for Mobile Money services in Nigeria\n\nOn Friday, July 9, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s banking regulator, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), released the new Framework and Guidelines on Mobile Money Services in Nigeria(PDF) as part of its financial inclusion strategy for the unbanked.\n\nWhat\u2019s the gist? The last time CBN updated these regulations was in 2015, and while they do not differ significantly from the old ones, there are some new introductions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClosely resembling regulations for Payment Service Banks (PSBs), Mobile Money Operators (MMOs) are not allowed to grant any form of loans, advances and guarantees (directly or indirectly) or accept foreign currency deposits\n\nThey can\u2019t deal in the foreign exchange market \u2014 except to sell foreign currencies realised from inbound cross-border personal remittances to authorised dealers \u2014 accept any closed scheme electronic value (e.g. airtime) as a form of deposit or payment, or establish any subsidiary.\n\nWhat\u2019s the bigger picture? CBN\u2019s goal is seemingly to enhance financial inclusion. However, like we pointed out when we discussed Why Payment Service Banks could face an uphill battle in the Nigerian market, despite new services like agent banking, the introduction of BVN 2.0, and mobile money operations, there\u2019ve been minimal changes.\n\nAs of July 04, 2021, there are 48,762,163 BVN users in Nigeria. In comparison, in August 2020, there were 43.2 million users. For a country seeking an 80% financial inclusion rate by 2020, these are not good numbers, especially when examined in the light of its over 200 million population\n\nWill these new regulations bring the winds of change? During the week, I\u2019ll try to make sense of this puzzle.\n\nFlutterwave misses out on tax relief\n\nThe Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) has released its Report on Pioneer Status Incentive Applications Q1 2021 (PDF) under the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act.\n\nThe pioneer status is an incentive that gives tax holidays to qualifying industries and products for three years, extendable for one or two additional years. It can be full or partial.\n\nNigeria\u2019s second unicorn, Flutterwave, was one of the ten companies denied the incentive. Others include Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN), Envoy Hotels, Fountain Manufacturing Company Limited, Al-Hamsad Rice Mill Limited, Benchmark Constructions Limited, and Super Packaging Limited, Royal Foam Products Nigeria Limited, ENGIE Fenix Nigeria Limited, Technology Solutions Limited, and Echostone Development Nigeria Limited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer The International Centre for Investigative Reporting, Emeka Offor, Director of Strategic Communication Office of the NIPC, said that some of the firms whose applications were denied could have avoided the situation if they had followed the directives of the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act.\n\nSpeaking on Flutterwave, Offor said, \u201dIn the case of Flutterwave, for instance, they applied within the third year of operations. Therefore, it is time-bound, according to the Industrial Development Act. Some other firms who had their applications for tax reliefs declined had a similar concern.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Flutterwave\u2019s application was denied because it failed to apply in time. This brings all sorts of questions to my mind. How many Nigerian startups know about government incentives like this one? And if they know, do they apply? Which incentives apply to them?\n\nYou already know the drill. Watch out for a story later this week by yours truly.\n\nWorld Population Day\n\nDid you know that July 11th was World Population Day? Don\u2019t be shy. You probably didn\u2019t. You can shock me and send evidence that you knew. Believe me. I want to see this.\n\nWhy does this concern you though? Just hear me out. Currently, Nigeria\u2019s population is estimated to be a whopping 211 million or more. According to the United Nations, from 2017 to 2050, it is expected that half of the world\u2019s population growth will be concentrated in just nine countries, and Nigeria is one of them. Big numbers indeed.\n\nBut there\u2019s more: According to the UN\u2019s population projections for 2020, about 62% were below age 25. By contrast, less than 5% are aged 60 years and above. Essentially, the median age in Nigeria is about 18, although this is expected to increase to 21.4 in 2050\n\nStill wondering why you should care? Nigeria\u2019s young population has been cited as a major attraction for digital activities. Is this an opportunity or a problem? If it is either, can we trust these figures?\n\nEmmanuel Paul will be doing a deep dive on this. Come back later today to read this story.\n\nWhat you missed on Techpoint Africa last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nDo white founders in Africa have an easier time getting capital?

Existing investors like Khosla Impact, ValueStream Ventures, Beta.Ventures, 500 Startups, and Story Ventures participated. New VCs like LocalGlobe, Intercept Ventures, and Future Africa also took part in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, Smile Identity has raised $11 million from investors with this latest funding round. In 2019, it raised $4 million in seed funding.\n\nWhat does Smile Identity do? Founded by Mark Straub and Willliam Bares in 2017, Smile Identity provides identity verification and KYC compliance tools to help African banks, telecom companies, financial service providers, and ride-sharing businesses better engage their customers.\n\nExpansion so far? Following the co-founders\u2019 arrival in Africa, the business has made key strides in its activities, such as the establishment of a local presence in six African countries: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, the company claims to connect to over 15 different identity authorities, while its ID validation covers over 250 million identities on the continent.\n\nThe new investment will allow the company to offer even better services and grow in new markets. It will also support more ID types and hire more engineers and staff on the continent.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nSafaricom increases the cost of airtime\n\nKenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has accepted the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s additional taxes proposal.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recent call for new taxes on airtime and data service prices. Finally, the bill has been passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of recent changes to the taxation of telephone and Internet data services, Safaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s top telecom companies, has adjusted the pricing of its products and services.\n\nWhat does this mean for Safaricom\u2019s subscribers? Calls made between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. will now cost Sh4.87 per minute, while calls made between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. will only cost Sh2.50 per minute.\n\nThe cost of Safaricom home fibre for the lowest package will rise to Sh2,999 from Sh2,900, while the silver package increases to Sh4,100 from Sh3,999.\n\nThe gold and diamond packages \u2014 up from Sh5,699 and Sh11,499 \u2014 will now cost Sh6,299 and Sh12,499, respectively.\n\nAdditional fees were also introduced for roaming and international calls. The cost to send a single short message is now Sh1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of browsing via airtime (without bundles) will increase at a similar rate to voice calls.\n\nSimilar? Mobile network operators, including Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya, have also adjusted their calling charges. The two telecom companies have raised the rate of calls to Sh2.78 per minute. Also, the price of Telkom Kenya\u2019s SMS message has increased to Sh1.15.\n\nMarketForce raises $2 million pre-Series A round\n\nFeatured Image Credit: TechCrunch\n\nAnother funding? Yes. Kenyan B2B retail platform, MarketForce, has raised $2 million pre-Series A to focus on its business-to-business (B2B) retail marketplace, RajeRaje.\n\nWho participated in the round? P1 Ventures, Y Combinator, Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and other unnamed investors.\n\nBefore now, the retail distribution platform raised $350,000 in seed round and a $150,000 cheque from Y Combinator as part of the accelerator\u2019s Summer 2020 batch. This round brings the funds raised by the company to $2.5 million.\n\nThe retail distribution platform got into Y Combinator accelerator\u2019s Summer batch 2020, and upon graduation, they decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRajeRaje is a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants and was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nWith RejaReja, it\u2019s interesting to see MarketForce joining other supply chain revamp startups like TradeDepot and Sokowatch to fix Africa\u2019s unorganised retail supply chains.\n\nRejaReja has more than 15,000 retail customers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania who use the platform to process thousands of orders daily.\n\nExpansion plans? It\u2019s planning on expanding to Nigeria with the new funds and expanding its product across East Africa.\n\nIncredibly, the founders \u2014 Tesh Mbaabu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Mesongo Sibuti, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) \u2014 are computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nNigeria to block MultiChoice Nigeria and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts\n\nDStv dish. Source: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.capetowndstvinstallation.com/\u201d>capetowndstvinstallation.com</a>\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, July 8, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) announced that it had directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA) in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nWhy did it happen? Abdullahi Ahmad, the Director of Communications and Liaison Department, said the company has continuously violated all contracts and agreements with the tax agency.\n\nBesides, MultiChoice allegedly denied the FIRS access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMuhammed Nami, Executive Chairman, FIRS, said that the companies have failed to provide relevant and timely responses to correspondences, and their records are not accurate and accessible.\n\nSo, the banks that handle business for MultiChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria were instructed to perform a balanced search on their accounts before undertaking any other transaction on their behalf.\n\nNonetheless, MultiChoice believes that the case is based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d because they were not formally notified on the matter. Also, they said they had not given authorities full access to their subscribers\u2019 information.\n\nMultichoice told Reuters that they had previously engaged in an open, transparent, and constructive dialogue with FIRS, and they hoped that issue could be resolved amicably.\n\nSimilar?

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has directed some commercial banks to freeze and recover \u20a61.8 trillion ($4.4 billion) from MultiChoice Nigeria (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts.\n\nThe firms are subsidiaries of South Africa-based MultiChoice Group, which provides television and other entertainment services across Africa like DStv, GOtv, and video-on-demand platform, Showmax.\n\nPer a statement issued on Thursday, July 8, 2021, by Abdullahi Ahmad, FIRS Director, Communications and Liaison Department, the decision followed the groups\u2019 refusal to grant the tax authority access to their servers for audit.\n\nIn the statement, FIRS said that it discovered that the companies have persistently breached all agreements and undertakings with the Service. They did not promptly respond to correspondences and lacked data integrity and transparency. It also added that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferring to the group\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary, the tax authority said MCN \u201chas avoided giving FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mohammed Nami, Executive Chairman FIRS, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nHowever, per TechCabal, MultiChoice\u2019s results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nAccording to Reuters, MultiChoice Group makes a third of its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. From the company\u2019s annual report, Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment.\n\nInterestingly, at the close of business yesterday, MultiChoice stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were down 7.38% from the previous day. The fall reached levels that have not been seen since October 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax to GDP ratio has steadily declined between 2001 to 2020, reaching a record low of 6.3% in July 2020\n\nWith such an abysmal tax to GDP ratio \u2014 one of the lowest in the world \u2014 the country has tried to increase its tax base. In 2017, it introduced the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), from which the government claimed to have raised \u20a670 billion\n\nIn 2019, it also increased its Value Added Tax from 5% to 7.5%, generating \u20a61.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiChoice becomes the second South African company to face a crackdown from Nigerian authorities. MTN has been the subject of several penalties, the most recent which occurred in 2018 involved a $2 billion tax bill for payments to foreign suppliers. The bill was later withdrawn.\n\nIn an official reply, MCN said it had not received any notification from FIRS yet. It has however indicated that it is willing to engage the tax authority transparently and constructively. It also said its operations in Nigeria are continuing.\n\nThe company says it has been and is currently discussing with FIRS regarding their concerns and believes they can resolve the matter amicably.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these words will ring true in the coming days.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLagos \u2013 Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, have intercepted a consignment of 26.150kilograms of heroin with a street value of over N6.5billion at the SAHCO shed of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, MMIA, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nIn a statement by Femi Babafemi, Director, Media & Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, the illicit drug had arrived Lagos in 25 parcels from South Africa through an Airpeace Airline flight on 30th June, 2021 and was detained for screening following reasonable suspicion of the content of the consignment.\n\nA follow up operation was subsequently carried out the following day, 1st July when narcotic officers of the MMIA command trailed the driver and a clearing agent that were assigned to deliver the consignment to the house of a baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu at No. 132 Lateef Adegboyega Street, off Ago palace way by Grandmate bus stop Okota, Lagos.\n\nDuring the follow up operation, Tony Chidi Onwurolu who obviously mounted a counter-surveillance around his neighbourhood fled his home before the arrival of the team of operatives who stormed his residence. They were however able to search his home and recovered a number of documents to establish his true identity.\n\nFollowing the development, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd) has directed that the fleeing drug baron, Tony Chidi Onwurolu be declared wanted immediately and his details submitted to Interpol for tracking across the world.\n\nHe therefore directed the Agency\u2019s Directorate of Assets and Financial Investigations as well as the Directorate of Intelligence to deploy their networks to fast track the arrest of Onwurolu.\n\nMarwa said in view of the volume of heroin brought into country by the fleeing baron, the Agency would deploy all available mechanisms, locally and internationally, to track him and bring him to face charges in the law court.\n\n\u201cThose who have been on the run for 10 years and some for five years, we have since tracked them and are now facing charges while cooling their heels behind bars. The latest one won\u2019t be an exception, because he can only run but cant hide for too long before we get him\u201d, Marwa vowed.\n\nIn the same vein, operatives of the Command also intercepted a 4.3kg of skunk imported from Canada. The package, which came on Ethiopian Airline, was concealed in nine packs of cereals.\n\nAlso on 9th July, one Babatunde Usman Omogbolahan Bakare was intercepted by NDLEA operatives with 550grams of cannabis and 50grams of Rohypnol (Flunitrazepam) concealed in six jerry cans of local herbal mixtures called Gabo at SAHCO export shed, MMIA, Ikeja.\n\nThe drug was detected during outward clearance of Cargo going to Dubai.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday 6th July, operatives of the MMIA Command, conducted a follow-up operation at Gate 2, Ladipo Oluwole Street, opposite Guinness Bottling Company, Ikeja, where one Animashaun Kabiru was apprehended for questioning about a bag containing bitter cola, which was brought for export to the UK.\n\nWhen the bag of bitter kola was searched, it was discovered that the bitter kola were mixed with some wraps of a substance suspected to be illicit drug.\n\nThirty-six wraps of the suspected substance later tested positive for Cocaine weighing 600grams.\n\nIn a related development, an Uber driver, Lawal Tunde Rasheed, arrested on 8th June in connection with the seizure of a cocaine consignment has been let off the hook following his cooperation that led to the arrest of the real owner of the drug, Mr. Egbo Emmanuel Maduka, who in his statement accepted ownership of the consignment and absolved Lawal of any complicity.\n\nWhile commending officers and men of the MMIA Command of the Agency for the series of seizures and arrests in the past week, Gen. Marwa asked them not to rest on their oars, adding that \u201cwe must all remain fully prepared and proactive at all times if we have to battle this scourge to a standstill.\u201d\n\n...",

You may have to involve your financial advisor before taking investment decisions.\n\nACCESS BANK\n\nAccess Bank currently has earnings per share (EPS) of N3.24 and a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 2.81, which makes it cheap to invest in.

All the four roads allocated to Dangote span a distance of 271.72 kilometres.\n\nDangote, according to the approval by President Muhammadu Buhari, is to engage in the re-construction of Ohafia-Arochukwu road in Abia/Akwa Ibom States; re-construction of Enugu-Onitsha Expressway Road in Enugu/Anambra States; the construction of deep seaport access road through Epe to Sagamu-Benin expressway, and the construction of Kaaba-Ekiti Boundary road in Kogi/Ekiti states.\n\nIt would be recalled that in 2019, following President Buhari\u2019s approval, Dangote Industries Limited undertook the re-construction of the 34 kilometres Apapa Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota road in Lagos state, and also the 43km re-construction of Obajana-Kabba road in Kogi State, while the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) undertook the construction of Bodo-Bonny road and bridges across Opobo Channel in Rivers state.\n\nIt would be recalled that DIL has already completed the 43km Obajana-Kabba road. The road, which was described by motorists as the country\u2019s most strategic highway that is aiding travelers moving between the North and the South, is a concrete road that was built to last longer than asphalt roads, and does not have potholes.\n\nThe Site Engineer, Samuel Obosi, in a chat with the media recently assured that the dual carriageway would be durable and less susceptible to potholes and repairs like asphalt roads, which will also greatly reduce the rate of road accidents.\n\nSome motorists said it is now one of the busiest roads. \u201cThank God it is a concrete road. It can withstand any heavy-duty vehicle,\u201d Alhaji Lamidi Sikiru, a driver said. Another motorist, John Moses, a member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, said his taxi business is booming compared to when the road was in a bad state and barely used.\n\nSpokesperson of the Apa Bunu Kingdom, Sam Omosayil, commended Dangote Group, saying the road has attracted a lot of businesses along it. The Bajana of Obajana Land, King Idowu Senibi, also described the project as gigantic and the first of its kind anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking, the traditional head of Akpata Land, Frederick Durojaiye Balogun, said his people are very proud of Alhaji Aliko Dangote, adding that the Dangote Cement, Obajana plant, which is the single largest cement plant in the world, has brought honour and respect to their kingdoms.\n\nKing of Okebunku Land in Kabba Bunu Local Government, Timothy Omonile, commended Dangote and charged other philanthropists to emulate him.",

          "text": "Misinformation and conspiracy theories towards discouraging the public from getting vaccinated against COVID-19 have continued to spread rampantly on social media platforms.\n\nThe social media was recently awash with videos of people claiming that the vaccine had created magnetic field around vaccination site and that it was causing their body to light up an electric bulb.\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) has come out to say that the claim was untrue.\n\nExecutive director of the NPHCDA, Dr Faisal Shuaib, says the anti-vaccination elements have come up with magnetic conspiracy deceiving people with videos, that COVID-19 vaccine creates magnetic field around vaccination site and can cause the body to light up an electric bulb.\n\nShuaib says although the people who are manufacturing conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are in the minority, the virulence of social media increases their reach.\n\nThe ED, who spoke in Abuja points out \u201cToday I would like to make very clear and demonstrate publicly that COVID-19 vaccine does not create any magnetic effect around the vaccination site or any part of the body for that matter, neither does it cause the body to light up an electric bulb.\n\nStating that it\u2019s a common fact that people with wet, moist or sticky skin can have objects stuck to their skin especially in smooth areas. Strong friction also allows for objects to stick to the skin. And the fact that COVID -19 vaccines does not contain any metal.So, how can it generate magnetic field or light an electric bulb?\n\nA health worker in Abuja, Jonathan Jane who just collected her second dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, told me that her husband was getting really worried for her after watching some of the videos of spoons, phones and other metals magneting people\u2019s skin, but says she was very sure that the claims were not true.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA journalist craving anonymity, who has also received his second dose of the vaccine said initially, he was getting scared after watching one of the videos but that he became relieved after he tried placing metal objects around his vaccination spot and there was no magnet.\n\nMeanwhile, 2,495,632 people have been vaccinated with the first dose, while 1,370,130 have received their second dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the country, said Shuaib.\n\n\u201cOverall, Nigeria has successfully utilised 3.9million doses, representing 96 per cent of the 4,024,000 doses of the vaccines received in the country. Nigeria is poised to achieve 100 per cent utilisation of the doses of vaccine it has received in the next few days.\n\n\u201cThis is to ensure that people are protected against COVID-19, and normalcy is restored,\u201d he explained.",

So, of what use is his arrest? After he was arrested, the kidnapping didn\u2019t stop in the north; many students were kidnapped in Kaduna last week. Where were our security agencies? Why can\u2019t they use the same temerity to arrest all those people doing this thing (killings)? Arresting Kanu will not solve the problem.\u201d\n\nHe blamed the rise of insecurity and multiple reports of unknown gunmen on politicians.\n\nMbaka said, \u201cpoliticians will buy ammunition and give it to millions of youth, and after the elections, no one collects the ammunition back.\u201d\n\nMbaka said he made the request when some government agents, whom he did not mention, allegedly came calling with some offers.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome persons came to me some time ago that they have two slots for me.

They said I should mention what I need.\n\n\u201cMy first request was that they should release Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cHas anybody seen Kanu kill anyone? Kanu is not a murderer. Have you caught him with guns? Why arrest someone who has never kidnapped anyone? Our land must yield an increase. Kanu is not herdsmen, kidnappers, or bandits, or Boko Haram. He does not carry ammunition and he is not even an unknown gunman. My job is to say what the spirit asked me to say.\n\n\u201cIf you use the same aggression you deployed to arrest Kanu to address terrorism, things will change. It would help if you used the same temerity to address poverty, herdsmenism, injustice, corruption, and unhealthy tribalism. I am for truth and justice.\n\n\u201cI cannot support terrorism. There is agitation everywhere. All the men of God are agitating silently. The police and the army are agitating. Do you blame them? If they talk, they will be killed. In the mosque, there is agitation. You don\u2019t arrest the agitation. You arrest the cause of it. People are hungry and angry. Millions are idle and an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria is doing very well, will Kanu emerge? I am for justice, equity and fair play.

Henry had been appointed as premier by Moise on Monday but interim prime minister Claude Joseph has been in charge of the government since the murder.\n\nPresidential and legislative elections in the country are scheduled for September.",

          "text": "The Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency in Kaduna State, following worsening state of insecurity which has resulted in wanton kidnappings and killing of Innocent people by bandits in the state.\n\nThe MBF in a statement issued by its National President, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, in Abuja yesterday, said Ksduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, appeared not prepared to tackle the security challenges confronting the state.\n\nThe forum expressed concerns that the governor had not done anything to secure weak communities against further attacks on vulnerable communities by bandits it alleged were executing the agenda of Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the Kaduna State government at press time last night proved abortive, as calls and text messages to the telephone of the spokesperson to the governor, Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, remained unreplied.\n\nBut the MBF regretted that despite the governor\u2019s refusal to negotiate with the bandits, he had continued to provoke bandits through unguarded utterances that had further enraged them to unleash more terror attacks on communities.\n\nThe statement read: \u2018\u2019The Middle Belt Forum, MBF, is deeply worried by the ugly security situation in the country, especially Kaduna State where the rising spate of insecurity has continued to degenerate on a daily basis.\n\n\u2018\u2019Communities across various local government areas in the state have come under unending severe attacks resulting in gruesome massacres, raping of women, destruction of property, incessant kidnappings made worse by huge payments of ransom to secure release of abducted persons and displacement of thousands of people out of their homelands.\n\nWhile the above scenario has become the new norm in Kaduna State, the political authorities seem either incapable of dealing with these security challenges or deliberately unwilling to stop the recurring bloody tide headlong, thereby suggesting complicity on their part.\n\n\u2018\u2019More worrisome is the fact that attacks by these killer herdsmen and Fulani kidnappers on defenceless communities have led to massive displacement of people from their ancestral lands, thereby creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis situation and rendering farmers unable to access their farmlands for agricultural activities.\n\n\u2018\u2019Current attacks on schools have also led to the withdrawal of pupils and students from schools or outright closure of such schools. The negative consequences of these on education and food security can only be imagined.\n\nOn the other hand, kidnappers have taken over all the routes linking Kaduna State to other parts of the country where they have continued to unleash terror on road users.\n\n\u2018\u2019These criminals are not only engaged in abducting farmers from their farmlands, but have also resorted to breaking homes at night to abduct people.\n\n\u2018:Sometimes, members of an entire family are kidnapped and herded into the forest where relatives of victims are forced to pay unimaginable amounts of money in ransom. Oftentimes, some abducted persons are killed even after such ransoms are paid.\n\n\u2018\u2019This trend has triggered massive relocation of residents who now abandon homes they had built with retirement entitlements and now squat in crowded neighborhoods only waiting to be further invaded.\n\n\u2018\u2019In recent instances, two nurses were abducted from the Idon General Hospital in Kajuru LGA of Kaduna State on April 22, 2021, and are yet to be released even after the payment of N10 million to the kidnappers.\n\n\u2018\u2019On Monday July 5, 2021, these daredevil kidnappers who have become brazen also launched an attack on the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre in Zaria where they abducted 10 persons, including five nurses, infants and their mothers.\n\n\u2018\u2019On May 21 2021, about 77 members of the Libere community (including women and children) in Kajuru LGA were abducted when they returned to their ancestral land after taking refuge in an Internally Displaced Persons, IDP, camp since May 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019This incident has never had any mention from the regular security updates routinely issued by the government of Kaduna State. As it stands, the abductors are demanding N350 million as ransom.\n\n\u2018\u2019At the weekend, Warka village in Zangon Kataf LGA was attacked and nine persons, including four children, three women were killed just as no fewer than 13 homes were completely razed down.\n\n\u2018\u2019Before the weekend, Kiboro village in the same local government area came under attack on Wednesday. A widow and her three children were slaughtered by the murderers. Again, on Friday June 21, 2021, Ungwan Madaki community in Chikun LGA, an outskirts of Kaduna, was attacked by these cold-blooded criminals who killed two persons and kidnapped 26 others, including infants. Four of the victims have been killed over inability to pay the ransom, while 22 persons are still languishing in the den of their captors.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2019Before then, two lecturers with six students from the Nuhu Polytechnic Zaria were abducted and were only released on Friday after the payment of huge ransoms for their release.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Afaka students\u2019 abduction on March 11, 2021 and the murder of five undergraduates of Greenfield Students in the last week of April, 2021 and the payment of N200 million by poor parents to secure release of the undergraduates have become reference points in portraying the daring expedition of these callous criminals that have made our communities not only unsafe but poorer.\n\n\u2018\u2019Most disturbing is the recent abduction of over 120 students of Bethel Baptist High School in Damishi that is located in the outskirts of Kaduna. These minors are still being held captive in the forest with no food, shelter or medication.\n\n\u2018\u2019This new wave of attacking schools by the bandits appeared to be in the agenda of Boko Haram and is aimed at frustrating the education of future generations upon whose shoulders lie the future greatness of our nation.\n\n\u2018\u2019The most worrisome is the attitude of Governor Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai towards tackling the security challenges confronting the state. While he has refused to negotiate with kidnappers, he has also not done anything to secure these weak communities against further attacks on vulnerable communities.\n\n\u2018\u2019More than anytime, Governor el-Rufai has continued to provoke bandits through unguarded utterances that have further enraged them to unleash more terror attacks on various communities.\n\n\u2018\u2019Arising from the glaring failures by Governor el-Rufai to protect lives and property, the MBF is calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency on Kaduna State as the governor has shown gross incapacity to maintain peace.\n\n\u2018\u2019We call on security forces to create necessary synergies with attacked communities through the establishment of local vigilante groups to track down these criminals that have declared war on our people.",

But I won\u2019t have people say that I didn\u2019t want to take a peno when I said I will\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018I chose the takers\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, England manager Gareth Southgate has taken responsibility for the penalty decisions.\n\nEngland, playing in their first major final since 1966, lost 3-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Wembley.\n\nSouthgate also brought on Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford deep into extra time specifically to take spot-kicks, and they also both missed as England blew an early advantage in the shoot-out.\n\n\u201cI chose the takers,\u201d Southgate told ITV. \u201cI\u2019m unbelievably disappointed not to go one step further.\n\n\u201cWe decided to make the changes at the end of the game, but we win or lose together as a team.\u201d\n\nArsenal winger Saka, who had only made five international appearances before the tournament, saw England\u2019s final penalty saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma, after Jorginho had wasted the chance to secure the title for Italy when his effort was kept out by Jordan Pickford.\n\n\u201cThat was my decision to give him (Saka) that penalty,\u201d said Southgate, who missed the crucial penalty when England lost in the Euro 96 semi-finals to Germany on home soil.\n\n\u201cWe worked with them in training. It was a gamble.\u201d",
          "summary": "English midfielder Jack Grealish has defended himself after insinuations surfaced that he chose not take a penalty in the dramatic shootout loss to Italy in the final of Euro 2020 on Sunday.\nPundit Roy Keane had said he was unhappy that Grealish and Raheem Sterling had chosen not to take the fifth decisive penalty, instead of 19-year-old Bukayo Saka.\nSaka\u2019s penalty was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma as England suffered heartbreak at Wembley.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re (Raheem) Sterling or (Jack) Grealish, you cannot sit there and have a young kid [Saka] go up for a penalty ahead of you, you can\u2019t,\u201d former Manchester United star Keane told ITV.\n\u201cThat was my decision to give him (Saka) that penalty,\u201d said Southgate, who missed the crucial penalty when England lost in the Euro 96 semi-finals to Germany on home soil.",

          "text": "Outside a small store in South Jakarta, dozens of people line up for the chance to save the life of their loved one.\n\nIn the Indonesian capital, oxygen is an increasingly precious commodity as the country battles a relentless surge in cases of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to buy an oxygen tank for my mother, she tested positive on Sunday and we tried several hospitals but all are full,\u201d Pinta said, as she waited in line.\n\n\u201cI received a list of places that sell oxygen but every single one that we went to was closed or ran out. Thank God, my friend told me to come here.\u201d\n\nSearching for oxygen in Jakarta in recent weeks is an unpredictable scramble \u2013 a sick person\u2019s chances of survival can come totally down to chance, depending on whether their relative was at the right store, at the right time.\n\nAnother woman in line, Winda, says she is trying to find oxygen for her brother-in-law.\n\n\u201cI had trouble finding oxygen last night. I went to five places, including this store and a big medicine market but all ran out,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe went to the health centre \u2026 they said to give oxygen at home while waiting for the hospital \u2026 but we have been waiting for two days and there\u2019s no hospital referral.\u201d\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Minanti is caring for her elderly father at home after she tried and failed to get him admitted to hospital.\n\nMinanti is one of many Indonesians forced to care for the sick at home. Her father has underlying conditions that make him particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 [Al Jazeera]\n\nHe is diabetic, and has heart and kidney problems, too, putting him at increased risk from coronavirus.\n\nBut he still could not get a place in Jakarta\u2019s crowded hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe tried hospitals near our home \u2026 we went to the emergency unit and they said, \u2018look around, it is full,\u2019 and they told us even they have problems with oxygen,\u201d Minanti said.\n\n\u201cAnother hospital was also full. They have a tent in front of the building, full of sick people \u2026 we felt so scared.\u201d\n\nNow, like thousands of Indonesians, Minanti understands the struggle of trying to procure an oxygen cylinder during this wave of infections.\n\n\u201cIt was super difficult to get the oxygen tank. We borrowed it and suddenly, the owner asked for it back because they, too, got COVID,\u201d she said.\n\nEventually, she was able to buy an oxygen tank \u2013 but refilling it is a constant struggle.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like a miracle to get the tank. Now, he has to have oxygen nonstop because he is constantly out of breath,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe government should have responded fast from the beginning \u2026 now, cases have exploded. The oxygen tank is difficult to buy, and it\u2019s difficult to refill and the hospitals are already full.\u201d\n\nIt is not only the general populace struggling with shortages of oxygen and medication \u2013 health professionals also told Al Jazeera they do not have enough essentials to help everyone in need.\n\nDr Erni Herdiani is the head of the Lemah Abang Health Clinic in Bekasi, on the outskirts of Jakarta.\n\n\u201cWe need oxygen tanks, oxygen refill and medication. We treat severe conditions, we need medication like remdesivir and we cannot find it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need to give the patients oxygen and medication. We are lacking oxygen tanks \u2026 this is beyond my expectation. So many patients need oxygen and the refilling lately is even harder.\u201d\n\nDr Erni would like to buy more oxygen tanks for her clinic but says it is impossible.\n\n\u201cRight now, we just cannot buy it. There are no tanks. We need the government to provide it,\u201d she said.\n\nAs hospitals in Java and other parts of Indonesia edge closer to full capacity, it is up to public health clinics to look after some of the thousands of sick people who cannot be admitted.\n\nBut Dr Erni\u2019s team is also under pressure \u2013 there are fewer than 30 health workers at her clinic and they are monitoring more than 300 patients.\n\nEvery day, a team of roving medics from her clinic visit some of the sick.\n\nThe team has become accustomed to finding patients dead in their homes.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is a lot of loss [of life] at home. Sometimes, we have the report of someone who died, when we check the body, they are positive,\u201d she said.\n\nDr Erni believes the official government figures, which put the death toll at more than 66,000, are an underestimate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s underreported. It is very sad because we could not help them.\u201d\n\nEven major hospitals are grappling with shortages or delays in receiving oxygen.\n\nThis week, at least 33 patients with severe coronavirus infections died in hospital in the city of Jogjakarta, on the island of Java, when the hospital temporarily ran out of oxygen.\n\nA spokesperson at Dr Sardjito General Hospital told the media there had been delays from suppliers.\n\nDr Siti Nadia Tarmizi from the Indonesian Ministry of Health said they have already rectified logistical issues in transporting oxygen.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Jogjakarta \u2026 because of the number of patients, their stock was running out very fast and the next shipment was only the following morning. They had limited oxygen \u2026 time was lacking there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are speeding up the distribution. Previously, it was two or three days, now we are asking [them] to be ready to send within a 12- to 24-hour cycle.\u201d\n\nHealthcare workers check the oxygen tanks inside an emergency tent for patients under observation for COVID-19 at a hospital in Bekasi near Jakarta [File: Mast Irham/EPA]\n\nThe health minister has instructed oxygen producers to redirect their efforts towards providing medical rather than industrial oxygen.\n\n\u201cWe are working on managing the oxygen situation, in fact from our national gas industry, the capacity is still there,\u201d Dr Nadia told Al Jazeera.\n\nDr Nadia said the priority is to provide oxygen for hospitals and public health facilities. She said there is no oxygen shortage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that has happened. We currently don\u2019t see that issue for health facilities, they have low numbers but we try to fill up their stock,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCases might increase to 50,000 or 70,000 a day. The need [for oxygen] is fulfilled but it is not at the safe level yet.\u201d\n\nDr Nadia says the Ministry of Health did not anticipate such a big jump in cases.\n\n\u201cThe main problem was, last week, we had a huge number of patients which we did not expect,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to find ambulance and health facilities. Sometimes, when reaching the health facility, they already died on the way \u2026 or patients are dying in their homes.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria: Central Bank Advocates Private Sector Funding to Tackle 22m Housing Deficit",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has stressed the need for the mobilisation of private sector funding to redress the country\u2019s 22 million housing gap.\n\nThe Deputy Governor (Economic Policy) of the CBN, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, gave the advice in his personal statement at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, a copy of which was posted on the regulator\u2019s website at the weekend.\n\nAccording to Obiora, the CBN has collaborated with the federal government and the private sector to stimulate the economy and prevent economic scarring, through various interventions targeted at households, SMEs, health, agricultural and manufacturing sectors.\n\nHe stated that whilst the impact of the policies on the economy was undeniable, but given the fragile recovery and coupled with long-standing infrastructural challenges, more action would be required to return the economy to full recovery.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor example, I believe this is the right time we start addressing the housing deficit by making a big push in mortgage financing to reduce the 22 million housing deficits in Nigeria. We also need to put in place a trade policy that will encourage SMEs, and boost non-oil exports, as well as invest more in infrastructure and the digital economy.\n\n\u201cThis offers opportunities for investments and job creation that will boost economic growth in the near term. However, it will require mobilising private sector funds, especially in the light of Nigeria\u2019s huge investment requirements and limited fiscal space.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a member of the MPC, Mr. Robert Asogwa, stated that accelerating the distribution of bank liquidity to firms and households in a targeted manner would ensure an early return to pre-pandemic output levels.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong belief that the cost of withdrawing the CBN monetary stimulus too soon will exceed that of withdrawing it too late and it is thus important for the central bank to continue monitoring the domestic and global macroeconomic developments.\n\n\u201cOnce there are clear signs that economic conditions are normalising, the bank should stand ready to take appropriate actions to address any upward pressure on inflation over the medium term,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his contribution, the Deputy Governor, Operations Directorate, Mr. Adebisi Shonubi, said the country was facing the increasing need to refocus the economy and look beyond oil as many jurisdictions scaled down further investments involving the use of fossil fuel.\n\nHe said: \u201cInterestingly, the speed and source of our recovery underscored the fact that recent economic downturn was strictly on account of external shock and not due to a weakness in domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWe must therefore take more steps to enhance domestic investment and productivity, as well as reinforce the internal stabilisers of the economy. Considering the observed gradual but steady positive outcomes of the current policy mix, I am convinced that as we strengthen implementation of the intervention programmes, we should maintain the status quo, and allow more time for the manifesting gains to fully mature.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, noted that short-term outlook of the economy continues to improve, congruent with strengthening global prospects.\n\nHe reaffirmed that the CBN will maintain its collaboration with fiscal authorities to proactively target and stimulate high impact productive sectors of the economy.\n\nEmefiele said long-standing structural imbalances and deep-seated supply-side constraints had propped inflation rates above the tolerance band of between six and nine per cent.\n\nAccording to him, the pervasive security strains, infrastructural debility, energy price shocks, exchange rate pressure, and COVID-19-induced vulnerabilities are the major cost-push drivers of inflation.\n\n\u201cThe bank will continue to engage and partner with fiscal authorities on measures to dismantle the encumbering structural bottlenecks and correct inflationary trends. Financial market conditions during the review period were subpar, with a bearish stock market, tepid liquidity in the money market, and lingering exchange market pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nObinna Chima",
