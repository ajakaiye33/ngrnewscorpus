          "text": "The leadership of the All Progressives Congress is waiting for the reconciliation committee led by Senator Abdullahi Adamu to turn in its report before going ahead to announce the modalities for its national convention, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nAlso, contrary to expectations, many governors of the APC who were expected to be in Abuja for a meeting on Sunday to decide when the convention would hold did not visit the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Senator Adamu-led committee has already visited Lagos, Osun, Ogun, Gombe and Kano states. Apart from Gombe State where Governor Inuwa Abdullahi and Senator Danjuma Goje agreed to sheathe their swords, there has been no indication so far that Adamu\u2019s interventions have yielded any fruit.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that the committee had not been able to get a commitment from the states to withdraw their cases while some of the aggrieved factions had handed a list of conditions to the reconciliation committee.\n\nIn Osun State, Governor Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, who is the current Minister of Interior, have been engaged in a publicised feud. At the congresses that were conducted last year, two factions are laying claim to the APC leadership.\n\nMr Kolapo Alimi, the Secretary of \u2018The Osun Progressives,\u2019 a faction supported by Aregbesola in Osun APC, during an interview with one of our correspondents, said despite meeting the Adamu committee, the case instituted against the ward congress of the party would continue.\n\nAlthough he did not foreclose the possibility of an out of court settlement, he explained that after the group had presented its petition before the Adamu panel, it would wait for the committee to give a report before deciding whether it would withdraw the case or not.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe court case and reconciliation can go together. The court usually encourages out-of-court settlement. After settlement, whatever is agreed upon will be made a consent judgment of the court.\n\n\u201cWe will wait for the report of the reconciliation committee. Their report will determine what will happen to the case. We have laid down our demands. So, the case will continue.\u201d\n\nIn Ogun State where Governor Dapo Abiodun and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, are fighting for the soul of the party, both sides have refused to sheathe their swords.\n\nThe chairman of the party in the state loyal to Amosun, Derin Adebiyi, who spoke with one of our correspondents in Abeokuta, said he was optimistic that there would be reconciliation but there was no update as of yet.\n\nMeanwhile journalists who gathered outside the APC national secretariat and the Kebbi State Governor\u2019s lodge where APC governors\u2019 meetings usually hold were disappointed on Sunday as the expected meeting did not hold.\n\nGovernor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, who is also the Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, had said while briefing State House correspondents last Friday that APC governors would meet on Sunday with a view to deciding on a date for the convention.\n\nWhen contacted on Sunday, however, the Director-General, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Lukman, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t call meetings on the pages of Newspapers. Governor Lalong made those statements in error because he read in one of the papers that there would be a meeting.\n\n\u201cBut the important thing is that definitely, consultation is going on and once the consultation is done and they decide on when the meeting will take place, I would be given the necessary directive to issue the appropriate notice to the governors.\u201d\n\nThe Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State is, however, expected to meet on Wednesday over the matter.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Vincent Ujumadu\n\nCHIEF George Moghalu, who recently obtained a judgement from the Federal High Court, Abuja annulling the All Progressives Congress, APC, primaries that declared Senator Andy Uba the candidate of the party in the November 6, 2021 Anambra governorship election said yesterday that he would have disappointed Nigerians if he did not challenge the exercise in court.\n\nMoghalu, a former national auditor of APC and Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) was among the 13 governorship aspirants of the party who insisted that there was no primaries. He later went to court and the court ruled that APC did not have a credible candidate for the election because it not conduct a credible primary.\n\nSpeaking for the first time since the court ruling, Moghalu said despite the party\u2019s poor performance at the Anambra governorship poll, he was satisfied that the right thing was eventually done.\n\nHe said although he had wished that his party APC, won the Anambra election, the process that produced a candidate for the party was faulty.\n\nAccording to him, rather than regret the failure of APC in the election, what should preoccupy the minds of party members is how to rebuild the party and win back the confidence of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not a must that I will be governor because power belongs to God and he gives to those he pleases. Maybe it\u2019s not God\u2019s time for me to be governor and I am not desperate about being a governor.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I would have failed in my responsibility if I didn\u2019t seek redress and accepted the fraud. The judgement agreed with me and confirmed my position there was no primary.\n\n\u201cWhat we did was not about an individual but about the system and stopping impunity as well as creating enabling environment for democracy to thrive. I insisted the party does what is right.\n\n\u201cFor every sincere APC member that loves the party, what should concern us is how to rebuild our party, resolve our differences and address our challenges.\n\n\u201cWe must win back the people\u2019s confidence, rather than wasting our time struggling for leadership. You don\u2019t elect or appoint a party leader; it evolves from the people.\n\n\u201cIt may not surprise you that the other day, someone said they\u2019re going to sack me from the party. I\u2019m not surprised. But the truth remains that it\u2019s an anomaly for a tenant to sack a landlord.\n\n\u201cI am a critical stakeholder of the party. You may not like my face, but when APC was formed, I was a member secretary. I didn\u2019t join APC, I was part of the formation.\n\n\u201cSo when someone who we were magnanimous to accommodate is boasting that he wants to sack me, I laugh. I am waiting for them.\u201d",

The same is the story of Badaiki Eromosere John, CEO of Harrybes Entertainment, an Asaba, Delta State- based film production outfit.\n\nBadaiki said he was inspired to establish the outfit following the inability of house owners to allow the film makers to use their property for filming due to the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe film house was powered by the drive to overcome the hurdles, where filmmakers were not allowed to use people\u2019s houses and hotels to shoot movies and especially without observing COVID-19 protocol.\u201d\n\nSharing his experience while marking one year anniversary of Harrybes Entertainment limited, Badaiki said the production outfit is positioned to bridge the gap in in terms of movie productions.\n\nPopularly known as Shaggybes, Badaike noted that the production house has contributed immensely to the growth of the Creative Industry since its establishment a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe ideas of setting up the production house came during the lockdown. There was a movie titled \u2018Open Confession\u2019 which I wanted to shoot then but due to COVID-19 protocol, it was difficult getting locations, as people were not allowing us to use their houses. \u2018\n\n\u201cI started considering the idea of setting up a production house. Today, it\u2019s a well-furnished duplex with a hospital, police station Office and more.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, the advantage of the production house is that one can spent a night at the inbuilt hotel. \u201c\n\nShaggybes said his production house has several movies to its credit.\n\nThey include \u2018Crown War\u2019, \u2018Mysterious Crown\u2019, \u2018Why Me\u2019, \u2018Open Confession\u2019, \u2018Lovers and Rivals, and \u2018Not Mine, among others.\n\nAccording to him, his new major project for January 2022 is going to be a mega-hit movie.\n\n\u201cMy Series is called \u2018BAKAYOKO\u2019. It is a big series that will be featuring a lot of movie stars,\u201d he said.",

We are having our organs meet from the 20th, 21th and 22nd. It is after that meeting that we will decide on what to do.\n\n\u201cThe planned subsidy removal is a major issue that we will discuss. We have other issues like the failure of the government to implement the electricity tariff reduction agreement. We will look into it at the meeting. I don\u2019t want to preempt the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has failed to implement the N15 per kilowatt-hour agreement on electricity tariff reduction by December 2021.\n\nA Technical Committee headed by Minister of State for Labour and Employment Festus Keyamo, had reached agreements on how to make the system work to the benefits of Nigerians.\n\nOther members of the committee included: Minister of State Power, Godwin Jedy-Agba \u2013 member; Chairman, National Electricity Regulatory Commission, Prof. James Momoh \u2013 member and the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Infrastructure, Ahmad Rufai Zakari as Secretary.\n\nRufai could not be reached as of press time.\n\nThe NLC, had in a statement last year said: \u201cCongress remains implacably committed to the ultimate reduction of electricity tariffs by N15 per kilowatt-hour by December 2021 as contained in the agreement. Congress hereby serves notice that the posture of the Federal Government to flout agreements is completely unacceptable and would be resisted.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has described the leadership of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) as delusional in its attempt to negotiate a better deal with the Federal Government for its members.\n\nThe NMA recalled that the JOHESU, in a publication, stated that if the NMA is involved in its negotiations with the Federal Government, it will discontinue the process.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 association stated that physicians have had to make sacrifices in the health sector to ensure that all other allied health professionals were comfortable.\n\nIt stressed that in an attempt to placate JOHESU, physicians had to bend backwards by recommending relativity in emoluments below what is obtainable for physicians internationally to the disenchantment of members of the NMA.\n\nIt added that the JOHESU leadership deliberately spreads wrong information to its members and the public in a bid to emotionally blackmail the Director of Hospital Services (DHS) of the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) on welfare issues affecting its members.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the NMA, Dr. Aniekeme Uwah, made this known in a statement in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is worthy to note that doctors in administrative positions have worked hard to create a healthy balance in welfarism between physicians and allied health professionals in the health sector.\n\n\u201cAlso known for an insatiable appetite for spreading misinformation and disinformation, it is no surprise, therefore, that JOHESU threw caution to the winds once more by attempting to emotionally blackmail the Director of Hospital Services (DHS) of the FMOH on welfare issues affecting her members.\n\n\u201cThis is a well known strategy of JOHESU after failing in discussions oiled in hard evidence.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is no basis for JOHESU to ask for the same salary as for Medical Doctors as this is not the standard practice worldwide.\n\n\u201cJOHESU knows that there is a relativity agreement between the Federal Government and the NMA on CONHESS and CONMESS.\n\n\u201cIf the office of the DHS, FMOH drew the attention of the FG to the extant agreement on call duty allowance as signed in 2001 and basic salary as corrected and signed in 2014, she is only stating the obvious facts and should be commended for her due diligence.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment (FMOLE) know the implications of breaching the agreement on relativity.\n\n\u201cAs a reminder, the NMA is not opposed to any salary increase, adjustment or variation for JOHESU and her members provided that such action and identical values are applied to CONMESS to sustain the agreement with NMA.\n\n\u201cUnknown to many innocent and hard working JOHESU members, the leadership of JOHESU has increasingly become \u2018physicianphobic\u2019 which is a form of dysociopath.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf anyone is to be unhappy, it should be the Physicians who are being short changed by the deliberate refusal of the Federal Government to apply internationally accepted relativity in the remuneration of health workers in Nigeria. JOHESU is free to negotiate with anybody. Physicians are not afraid of this provided that the facts and international standard are presented and applied.\n\n\u201cBy making insinuation not to enter into negotiation with the Federal Government if doctors were involved, implies that such decisions would be extended to the Honourable Ministers of Health and that of Labour and Employment because they are Physicians.\n\n\u201cJOHESU should also stop meeting with the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Permanent Secretaries that are Physicians, Chief Medical Directors, Chairmen of Senate and House Committees on Health, Governors and Deputy Governors etc.\n\n\u201cJOHESU has forgotten that the DHS and other Physicians involved in their negotiation were there by virtue of the critical relevance of their offices and ot in individual capacities as Physicians.\n\n\u201cIf we copy and travel this discriminatory road, then NMA will not negotiate with the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cLastly, we wish to remind JOHESU that her members are primarily the staff of the Department of Hospital Services of the FMOH.\n\n\u201cThe input of the DHS cannot be wished away because she is key to any negotiation on welfare matters in the health sector.\u201d",

Amadi Gift of Ogbogoro community; Azeruowa of Ogbogoro community; and Kingsley Egbula, also of Ogbogoro community.\n\n\u201cAlso declared wanted are the following persons who are alleged to be in charge of oil bunkering activities in Isiokpo community: Mr. Kemkom Azubike, Mr. Mezu Wabali, Mr. Chigozi Amadi, Mr. Opurum Owhondah, Mr. Bakasi Obodo, Mr. Opus, Mr. Galaxi Mas, Mr. Chioma, Mr. Ogondah, Mr. Soldier, Mr. Chefo, and Nkasi.\n\n\u201cWe have also identified those behind illegal bunkering activities in Okrika communities, Port Harcourt Township, Rivers South-East and Rivers South-West Senatorial Districts and their names would be soon published and declared wanted, if they fail to voluntarily report to the police.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents of the State to report those involved in illegal crude oil refineries and other damnable activities to the Task Forces already set up at the State and Local Government levels for immediate action.\n\nGovernor Wike also reaffirmed the total ban on the use of motorcycles in Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt councils, which was necessitated by the collective threat they posed to the security of lives and property.\n\n\u201cAny person or corporate entity that requires the use of motorcycle for any lawful purposes must therefore first apply to the office of the Governor for permit and proper documentation of the operational details and particulars of both the motorcycle and designated rider(s).\n\n\u201cAgainst this background, we are hereby issuing the final warning to all those operation motorcycles shuttles and or hawking foreign exchange along Birabi Street, Hotel Presidential, GRA junction by Zenith Bank up to Tombia Street to immediately leave or be arrested and prosecuted.\u201d\n\nThe governor accused the traditional leadership, including members of Community Development Committees and youth leaders of Rumuola, Rumuogba and Okoro-nu-odo communities of collecting money from vendors and allowing street trading activities around and under the flyovers in these communities.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I hereby direct the traditional leadership of Rumuola, Rumuogba and Okoro-nu-odo communities to immediately stop all street trading activities around, in or under the flyovers in their respective domains or be deposed, arrested and prosecuted.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the traditional leadership of Rumuwoji Mgbuduku, Obiekwe, Nkpolu-Oroworokwo, Abali, Rebisi, Rumukalagbor-Oroworokwo and Ezimgbu communities are hereby directed to enforce the ban and ensure that no form of trading takes place around and under the flyovers located in their communities.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike also placed a total ban on the use of umbrella and table trading stands in the entire old and new GRAs of Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt City, Eleme councils.\n\nAccording to him, government has credible evidence that most of these purported traders in front of houses are informants who monitor and pass on vital details and information on the daily movement of very important persons to their criminal collaborators.\n\nGovernor Wike frowned at the failure of the Rumuokurushe traditional leadership to honour the terms of their undertaking not to allow any form of street trading on the Rumuokurushe market.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Rumuokurushe traditional leadership has apparently failed to comply with or enforce this condition in that market and Government will not hesitate to again shut it down if the ongoing breach continues unabated.\u201d",

The seconds are ticking down to what will be an opening win for the tournament hosts.\n\n90 min + 2: Konate has the merest hint of a sight of goal for Burkina Faso from a tight angle. He gets his shot on target but Onana is able to gather cleanly.\n\n90 min: Time\u2019s up, but five added minutes at a minimum will be played \u2013 mostly as a result of that incredibly long VAR check for the disallowed Cameroon goal.\n\n87 min: Aboubakar, the two-penalty hero for Cameroon, is now taken off with Neyou coming on. This is certainly tense, although it\u2019s hard to argue the football has been consistently of great quality. As stated, though, it\u2019s often the way with the nerves and high stakes that come with a tournament opener.\n\n85 min: Traore, another strong performer today, is replaced by Bande for Burkina Faso. Fresh legs for one final push on the Cameroon goal \u2026\n\n83 min: Toni Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, the Cameroon manager, issues a few instructions from the bench. His side are edging towards the win here but he\u2019d love a third goal.\n\n81 min: Another change for Cameroon: Christian Bassogog comes on for Ngamaleu, who has been outstanding, and absolutely full of running and quality on the ball. Man of the match, for me.\n\n76 min: The hat-trick hunting Aboubakar of Cameroon gets a sight of goal from an angle on the right of the area, and gives his shot everything, but it flies over.\n\n73 min: Zambo Anguissa hammers a powerful shot goalwards from the edge of the box for Cameroon. It nicks off a defender and out for a corner. The resulting corner is contested aerially but goes out for a goal kick to Burkina Faso.\n\n68 min: A double change for Burkina Faso now, with Konate and Sanogo coming on.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n66 min: Traore smacks a powerful shot from an angle for Burkina Faso, Onana saves.\n\nDouble change now for Cameroon: Toko Ekambi and Kunde go off, with Clinton and Choupo-Moting come on.\n\nThe time seems to have disappeared from my screen on Sky Sports so I\u2019m not entirely sure how long there is left \u2026\n\n64 min: Ngamaleu, who seems to be popping up on either flank, now takes the ball down the Cameroon left. The ball finds its way to Aboubakar, and it takes two defenders to take him out of the action, his shot blocked desperately at the last minute by two covering defenders.\n\n58 min: VAR check on a possible goal for Cameroon!\n\nCameroon, again, burst forward in numbers. Aboubakar lays the ball off to Ngamaleu on the right, whose initial shot is saved, but then hits Aboubakar and floats into the net. It\u2019s a VAR check \u2026\n\n61 min: Goal disallowed!\n\nThis is a very, very long VAR check \u2026 and at the end of it, the on-field decision stands, and Cameroon still lead 2-1.\n\nHalf-time! Cameroon 2-1 Burkina Faso\n\nTwo penalties have put Cameroon, the tournament hosts, in the lead after Burkina Faso opened the scoring.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere is still no light at the end of the tunnel for the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) as factional Caretaker Committee has formally written it to vacate the national secretariat of the party.\n\nChairman of the factional CECPC, Mustapha Audu who made the disclosure in a chat with Daily Sun, however noted that his group will not venture to occupy the secretariat forcefully due to the directive given to urchins to stab them if they dare come to the secretariat.\n\nAsked what happened to the initial threat from the APC Progressives Youth Mandate to occupy the secretariat and audit the Buni-led Caretaker Committee, he said that his faction has not only written them but also commenced the audit process.\n\n\u201cNothing happened to the threat because ours is a mental occupation. We won\u2019t do anything physical and that is why we can\u2019t even protest because we are aware that they have paid those boys outside the APC headquarters to stab people in the crowd when we show up there. It is a ploy to brand us violent people.\n\n\u201cWe know their trap and cannot fall into it. However, we have written to the leadership of the party to vacate the APC headquarters and we are waiting for them to do so. As for the audit, we have started the process.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that Mr President is aware of what we are doing. In fact, it was the DSS that arranged the meeting to be held between us and Mr. President because they know that what we are doing is critical to the survival of the party\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIt may surprise you to know that the DSS handled us with civility. I could not believe what they said to me. They said so many positive things. Incidentally, they told them to break into our houses, pick us up in the middle of the night, detain us for three days and then release us.\n\n\u201cBut in their own wisdom, they knew that carrying out their request means to turn Nigerian youths against the security agencies. The DSS advised us that so long as we are not doing anything violently, asking people to commit crimes, we should proceed in what we are doing. They said that since we are fighting for young competent persons to be included in the government, there is nothing wrong with that as far as they are concerned,\u201d he revealed.\n\nMustapha, an aspirant for the 2019 Kogi State governorship poll, warned that his faction is going ahead with the planned February 26 National Convention, even he added that it may still be dependent on the outcome of their meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari and the ability of the Buni-led committee to right their wrongs.\n\nOn whether they are going ahead to conduct APC parallel National Convention in February, he replied: \u201cWe are absolutely going ahead with the convention and February 26 is sacrosanct for it. We are going ahead with it because there is no reason for us to suspend the convention. There has been a series of meetings between us and the DSS and some of the leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that what we did has affected the plans of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee because they were not planning to hold any convention in the first place till July/August this year. They plan to combine the convention with the party primaries for the presidency. There were lots of illegalities going on truncated by our declaration. Our declaration has affected the plans of some of the leaders that don\u2019t have anything good for us,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile expressing readiness and giving conditions to sacrifice his agitations, he said: \u201cIf the right thing is done, I can. Simply, they should call us for dialogue, we want youth inclusiveness and we demanded for 12 out of the 27 national leadership positions. We are asking for vice chairmanship positions, two per geopolitical zone. There is still room for negotiation.\u201d",

          "title": "Sule Lamido exclusive: Beware of APC satanic plot",
          "text": "From Desmond Mgboh, Kano\n\nFormer governor of Jigawa State and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sule Lamido is a very blunt personality.\n\nIn this interview, he warned former President Goodluck Jonathan, his long-time political associate, against falling for the satanic overture of the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying it spells nothing but doom. He also throws light on the factors behind the choice of Dr. Iyorchu Ayu as the national chairman of the PDP.\n\nHe also spoke on Obasanjo, Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu.\n\nBesides, he passed his verdict on the Buhari administration, describing it as a grand failure even as he cautions the governors pushing to zone the PDP presidential ticket to the South to consult widely. Excerpt:\n\nWe just had a new leadership in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and as one of the leading chieftains of the party, we would like to have your impressions and expectations?\n\nI must say that asking me to give my impression of the new leadership under Dr Ayu honestly amounts to making me an onlooker of the entire process of his emergence and, therefore, an outsider. Your question is like this: something has emerged and I should give my view about the new development. I think you are not being fair to me. And I think it is inappropriate\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) Okay, let me put it in another way. You were part of the creation of the new leadership of the PDP, what are those factors that informed your choice of the leadership and what do you hope to achieve at the end of the day?\n\nYou see, PDP as a party was founded in 1998 based on some very clear visions in terms of our commitment to take Nigeria to a greater height. In fact, we began with a process of reconciliation and with addressing and curing all those obstacles which were militating against our political progress as a nation at that time. And so, the party was formed and thank God, based on these visions and the vision of the founding fathers. We formed the government for 16 years and there is no human history and administration, which is perfect. PDP is part of human history and which is operating in a very, very peculiar setting called Nigeria. So naturally, there are some problems. We cannot claim to have fulfilled all our wishes or attained all the goals we had set out for ourselves. But one thing is basic. The foundation of our democracy we enjoy today was purely100 per cent the efforts, commitments and thinking of the PDP. And that was why in 1999, even the then candidates from other political parties, were encouraged and designed to come from a particular zone. Because the intention was to reconcile Nigeria. And so, even at that time, the efforts were to bring candidates from a particular geo-political zone which all the parties also, in principle, agreed to. And what we have today, 22 years after, is the bounty of the PDP. It is what I may call the dividends of our efforts in the PDP. There have been some difficulties, there might have been some unfilled or unmet promises, some goals that were defined, but were not properly attained. But on the overall, the PDP laid the foundation of where we are democratically today. And in any case, these are understandable if you have to reckon with the environment called Nigeria. And so after 16 years, we lost power and APC came on board and since then, in spite of their claims of successes, in every sphere of life \u2013 whether it is economy, whether it is security, whether it is infrastructure, they are wobbling and we, Nigerians, are far better off seven years ago than we are today! Whatever are their claims, are you talking of the size of the debts when Jonathan left and what it is today? How many billion dollars are we owing today? When we left, in spite of their blackmail, in spite of their claim that the government of PDP was sponsoring Boko Haram, that it was our own making, we are better off at that time than we are today. In terms of the economy, it is the same story. In terms of the issue of corruption, it is the same thing. So, all their claims, all the claims they have mentioned are falsehood. These are people who had inherited PDP policies which they cannot properly implement. Look at this road between Abuja to Kano, it has been almost the same for the last six years. Look at power, the Mambilla issue. When Buhari came to power, he was abusing PDP. We stole money and that they were going to make sure that it comes into being. Six years into his government, even the road leading to Mambilla, there is no road leading to it. It has not been cleared. The only structure that is there is the structure that Obasanjo put up there in 2002. All their claims are nothing but propaganda and lies and today, Nigerians have come to accept governance as an act of telling lies. So, back to the PDP. In picking the new leadership, we have to ask ourselves. What was our vision in 1999? Where did we go wrong? And where did we derail? And so, we said that we need somebody who have clear knowledge of the background of the party at its formation, somebody who understands what the party was formed to achieve, who is committed and disciplined and patriotic and matured enough to be able to restore the confidence lost in PDP by Nigerians. And the only person who was there at the formation, somebody who is a key player, who believes in partnership, who believes in connectivity, and who believes in taking the entire party as a family and we settled for Ayu. Ayu is that ideal person with a clear head to lead the party at this time. He is the person to restore confidence in the party, unite the party and then give Nigeria the leadership that would convince them to invest their trust in PDP.\n\nYou are a founding father of the PDP and a good population of Nigerians is looking forward to the PDP for leadership of the country. What are those qualities, in your view , that would define the choice of the PDP presidential candidate?\n\nTo me, we need somebody \u2013 North or East, West or South, Muslim or Christians or even pagans or even those who worship irons \u2013 there are enough materials in the party to be used for the presidency. So the first thing now is doing away with those ephemeral things which define the thinking of leadership and governance in Nigeria. Things like he is from my zone, he is from my area, he is from my religion and so forth. We need somebody who is a true Nigerian, not a pretender. Somebody who will be there for Nigeria and somebody whom Nigerians can say yes this is our choice, I know this person and I understand him; somebody who understands the traditions of the country, who understands the culture of the people and who knows the country as an entity. And somebody who is able to give the kind of inspiration and confidence to the younger generation, who are apparently schemed out of anything decent under the present administration \u2013 because they have been abandoned, they have been left out on their own and they have been able to find their bearing on the streets. From the collective psyche of Nigeria, whether it is religious, whether it is economic and whatever, there has been a failure and the younger generation is trying to delink themselves, to find their own bearing. So, we need somebody who will be there to give them the inspiration and confidence. Apart from that, we need somebody who should be able to restore the authority of Nigeria as the leader of the black race. Nigeria is dualizing and, therefore, we need somebody who will be able to stand as a leader of a sovereign independent country known as Nigeria and then as a leader of the black race. Nigeria is the mother and father of the black race. We have 20 million blacks assembled in Nigeria. There is nowhere in the world where you will have this amount of blacks in the same geopolitical setting. Therefore, every black man, either in the Diaspora or here in Nigeria looks up to Nigeria for leadership and for inspiration. So, when we talk of our next leader, it should be somebody who understands that he has an international role to play \u2013 all these agencies. ECOWAS, African Union, United Nations and all other formations, so that we would be able to restore the standing of Nigeria the way we were in the past\u2026.\n\nWhat about somebody who will be able to tackle some of these problems that are pending, that are hydra-headed and we don\u2019t have the solution to deal with them?\n\nYou see those hydra- headed problems that you are talking about cannot be tackled by one person. I mean by the president alone. His is to offer leadership and give guidelines and directions so that the various institutions should stand and work properly \u2013 the bureaucracy, the clerics, the Mallams \u2013 I mean all the institutions in Nigeria must be up and doing the right thing for us to tackle these problems. He should be somebody who will give the right canopy and say you have a role to play for the emergence of a better Nigeria.\n\nA few days ago, it was reported somewhere that some PDP governors were meeting to push for a presidential candidate from the South. What is your take to this move?\n\nWell first, let me say that I am not very sure of this claim. But I read the report that they are meeting and may likely introduce this particular aspect of zoning. With all respect to them, as governors, there was PDP before they became governors. There will be PDP after they leave office. Two, we should be learning from our experiences. If the authority of the office you occupy becomes the determining factor of your political direction and political management, then it means that you are leaving a chuck of people outside. Then it means you are misappropriating their trust. So, I think that ideally, whatever they want to do, they need to consult, they need to know the mood of the country, to know the mood of the members of the PDP who also have right to be part of the process of the decision making they are about to make. I will only advise that whatever they do, they should consult widely, feel the pulse of the country, know the mood of the country and see whether what they say and what they about to do reflect the mood of the country. Sometimes, as governors you are engrossed in your own area of authority and because there, you are the Alpha and Omega, the mood there may be exactly what you want to feel. But if you use that mood to judge the whole country, you may be judging the country very wrongly. There you have total authority. You can say anything you want and the response will be positive. It is the office talking. But after your immediate sphere of influence, there are also others who should be reckoned with, the Nigerian people, the people in PDP, the leaders and also the voters, so you need to read their mood and their feelings and come up with options that align with them.\n\nSir, up till this moment, the PDP has been unable to fully revive itself in Northern Nigeria. Why is it so and what do you think the PDP should do to return to its pre-eminent position in Northern Nigeria?\n\nI think you are not being honest in your question or assessment of the PDP in Northern Nigeria. You are looking at it from your own point of view, your personal judgment. And that is not the correct picture. For you to get a clearer answer to your question, look at Northern Nigeria, how it was six years ago and what it is today. Then you compare and contrast and tell me, which of the North you will prefer. This too will help answer the question on which of the two parties has done better in Northern Nigeria. Our common bond, our unity in diversity, our love for each other as Northerners, they are all gone today. Tragically, they are gone. Under PDP, the region was a united entity within Nigeria. We ensured that the North was secured and supported one another and we made progress in many spheres of life. But see the difference. Look at where we were seven years ago, look at how we are today. Then judge.\n\nI am not talking about an assessment of the performance of the parties. I am talking about the man on the street, either as a result of his error of judgment or not, he seems not to be with the PDP as much as he is with the APC, despite the glaring failings of the Buhari governmen?\n\nApparently, you are trying to create a reality that is not true. But anyway, fine, fair enough. If the man on the street feels that he is okay with the way things are today, let him go along with the APC. If the feeling of the North today is that they are saver, happier, more united, more prosperous and more brotherly, fair enough. Let them have APC all the way to eternity. There is no problem. I have no problem. This is an issue of choice. God has conferred us with the intellect to be able to determine what is right or what is wrong, isn\u2019t it? This is something for you to rationalize for yourself and make your own judgment. There are people who climb the skyscrapers and jump. Are there no people like that? It is their own choice.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan has remained on the radar, he\u2019s like someone who is thinking of coming back to contest the presidency with a view to completing his uncompleted two terms as prescribed by the constitution. We may like to have your take on this. And what advice would you give to him?\n\nWell, the first thing to observe is that here, there are some technicalities. He has been there for six years\u2026 if you are talking that based on the constitution he is coming back to complete his tenure, is he coming for two years to vacate to becoming the vice president for the remaining two years? Answer me? Then, how do you put him there, under an arrangement or under the Constitution? All this swearing in is about eight years. He has done six years and you are now clamouring for him to come and complete the tenure. Is he coming for two years or for four years? Number two. You see when we lost the election and I met him. I met him after we lost the presidency and for the first time, I became a kind of either a preacher, a Mallam, or a pastor in terms of my preaching. And he Jonathan knows what I told him. It is for him to reflect and look at what I said. Because how he became Nigerian president, against all odds, over and above those who have been there in the business before him, is God\u2019s wish and God\u2019s will. Sometimes, you have to go back to your God to be able to remain stable, otherwise you remain insane. If you are not very, very careful, you will miss your metal stability. If he thinks that the people who are calling on him, the people who are clamouring for Jonathan to come to the APC, let him reflect, are they not the same people who had called him names? Were they not the ones? People who are now clamouring for Jonathan in APC? So, if he wants to go, let him go. If he wants to go there, this time around, he is helping himself, not God that is helping him because all other ones (political accomplishments), it was God that was helping him. Now, he is saying that having attained what he is today, let him also use his scheming and his human strength to attain the rest. He is saying, \u201cGod, thank you very much. Go and rest. You have done your own bit. You have made me Nigerian president. I have been there and having been what I am today, I think I can go ahead with what I want\u201d. So there is nothing to say, but to say that I wish him well. But then, he should know that he is coming to face his own party, which made him Nigerian president,which dignified him, which honoured him. He is coming to fight them? I wish him well. He doesn\u2019t know what is called APC? He does not know them? That is the problem. All this ego-caressing\u2026. They are vampires and they are very, very venomous. He has got a name, he has got a reputation which God has blessed him with and it is left for him to protect that reputation. Now, if he wants to aspire for the president, why can\u2019t him come back to his party?\n\nAre you saying that if he comes to aspire under the PDP, you are okay with that?\n\nIf he wants to come back, like the way he became Nigerian president , he will follow the same process of the party. In 2015, when he was there, there were primaries. In 2011, when he won, there were primaries and people ran with him. Let him come and join the race. And these his qualities that are being now promoted by APC \u2013 that he is this , that he is that \u2013 let them all manifest in his own campaign within the PDP umbrella. But for him to begin to rely on the preaching and promises of the enemy who is very, very satanic, an enemy, they say, comes out of your fold, comes to me in fresh and blood so I can confer the presidency on you. He should be very careful. That is all I am saying.\n\nWhat about former President Olusegun Obasanjo. He is still around. His shadow is everywhere for good or as some people say, for bad. What is your take on his un-retiring, endless political presence?\n\nYou see in terms of authority in governance, I must say that he enjoys a total monopoly, because he is a former Head of State of Nigeria. During our civil war, he was an active player. This is somebody who also worked for Nigeria\u2019s transition to democracy. And he fell from grace to grass, in fact, he fell from grace into prison. And by the time, he was in prison, he was able to reflect and know God even better. He was able to look at how God had been merciful onto him because the prison gave him time to go back to God. Sometimes when the ephemeral is pursuing us, when we are after these wordily things, it is only when something happens that we get back to track. So, Obasanjo was very lucky to pass through all of these. And God saved him and he came back. He was Nigeria\u2019s president for eight years. And thereafter, he became an international man, the world over. Everywhere he goes, people respect him. They understand him, they know him and on any issue, they know where he stands. He has no gift of speaking from both sides of the mouth. He speaks from one side of the mouth. And so, if he is still around in the political space of Nigeria, you can\u2019t do anything about that. That is what he is, a political phenomenon. Because he has this total dominance of authority and he is very, very knowledgeable. He knows this country very well, he knows Africa very well and in G77, he was the first Chairman when it was formed. In a number of settings and fora, local and international, he has been their number one. And he is very courageous; he would look at you in your face and tell you the truth. And that is what is called leadership. He has the moral authority to tell you the truth. If today, he, therefore, bestrides Nigeria, dwarfing everybody, it is understandable.\n\nAtiku, too, has been around the political space. He has refused to give up on the presidential project. What is your take?\n\nWhen it comes to aspiration, people have the right to aspire. Atiku has every right to run for the Nigeria\u2019s presidency and he has the right to aspire for as many times as he desires. So, why single him out? Buhari failed how many times before he became Nigeria\u2019s president? Tell me? He contested three times before he became Nigerian president. Atiku is very free to aspire for the topmost position.\n\nBut is Sule Lamido free to aspire and is he aspiring to be president of Nigeria this time around?\n\nHe is very, very free to aspire if he wants to.\n\nIs he aspiring ?\n\nI have been praying very, very hard and I have been saying my God , I beseech you, look on to Nigeria with mercy, see what we have been going through, see our situation. You blessed us with everything, we have human population, the resources, Lord we have got everything, but then we have been vandalizing ourselves. God please give us the best, give us someone who will save Nigeria. I am praying God give us for the best, no matter from where he is coming from, whether North or East, Christian or Muslim, God please give us someone who will save Nigeria, who make Nigeria, that is my prayer.\n\nLooking at the age of some presidential aspirants: Atiku, Sule Lamido , Tinubu and others, they said one of them is not even well. Nigerians are bothered that we are on the path of electing another president who might spend more time tending his health than addressing governance issues?\n\nI am not worried at all because God confers health and, therefore, you cannot vie into the authority of God in terms of his own creation. These are issues which are beyond you. You can talk about the age, bla-bla-bla. If God gives any of them the country, he will give him the health to run the country. This time around, Nigerians are praying very hard. Under APC, we have gone through hell. What we have suffered in the present charge is something else. Once bitten, twice shy. Today, Nigerians are saying God please give us your choice. All along we have been choosing our leaders ourselves, God this time around, we surrender to you, give us your choice. Ignore age!\n\nBut our world is changing. For instance, we have seen President Buhari, on a couple of times, lacking the speed to deal with a number of issues because he belongs to the previous age?\n\nNo, no! When you voted him into power, you knew he was very old. When the people were voting him, they knew he was old and they also knew his own capacity. So, they chose him. Like Obasanjo said recently, he is filled to his brim. He has come to his optimum and there is nothing more or new to offer. It is just like a full cup of water, if you pour any more, it will pour away. No matter what you do, he has reached his maximum capacity. You can\u2019t go beyond your ability. So, why are you complaining?\n\nSix years and half in power and with barely a year plus to go, your assessment of the performance of the Buhari administration?\n\nI have been saying this, that we were in government, we did our best for 16 years. It was not appreciated, we were maligned, we were called names. Boko Haram , they said that it was the making of the government. The issue of subsidy, they said it was a fraud, that it was all lies. So really, we did our best for the 16 years that we were in government. And we were flushed out based on these lies. Now back to your question, I think the best person to answer the question are Nigerians on who this government is working for based on their promises. Nigerians should be able to answer this question. If their answer is yes, that the government is doing very well, they can continue to eternity. You see there are so many wrongs in this administration and the question is which of the wrongs do you even take and discuss? Lack of empathy, lack of integrity, lack of creditability, poverty everywhere, insecurity in the whole of the land, tension and disunity, how do you take it and which do you take? Everything about their performance is woefully wrong! It is in shambles. I can\u2019t mark their script because I don\u2019t know where to start! However, for those who think that they are doing well, for those Nigerians who think that this is what they want, I wish them luck.",

          "text": "*Northern govs back deployment of Super Tucano Jets against bandits\n\n*Military invades terrorists\u2019 market in Borno, kills three fighters\n\n*FG seeks divine intervention to end security challenges\n\nChuks Okocha, Kinglsey Nwezeh in Abuja and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano\n\nFollowing the massacre of over 200 people by bandits in some parts of Zamfara State, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday vowed to hunt down and eliminate terrorists, including those who committed the mass killings in the state.\n\nThis came as governors of the 19 northern states of the federation have however lauded the federal government for approving the deployment of the newly acquired Super Tucano fighter jets to rout the bandits in some parts of the country.\n\nThe governors equally commended the government for declaring bandits as terrorists.\n\nAlso, in a fierce encounter, troops of 5 Brigade, Sector 3 Joint Task Force (JTF) of the Operation Hadin Kai in the North-east have killed three terrorists in a market in Damasak, Borno State.\n\nThe federal government has however stated that the fight against insecurity and other challenges would need divine intervention.\n\nThe terrorists had on Tuesday and Wednesday attacked Rafin Danya, Barayar Zaki, Rafin Gero and Kurfa villages in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas (LGAs) in the state.\n\nThey were said to be fleeing from Zamfara State as a result of ongoing military operations, when they invaded the villages and killed over 200 people.\n\nReacting to the incident, President Buhari yesterday vowed to hunt down and eliminate terrorists in the country.\n\nHe said the ongoing offensive against criminals would get more intense.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the president, who was outraged by the mindless massacre, described the Zamfara killings as an act of desperation by a routed band of criminals currently under heavy military attack.\n\nThe president assured Nigerians, especially those living in communities that have recently suffered terrorist attacks, that banditry would soon be history.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cThe latest attack on innocent people by the bandits is an act of desperation by mass murderers, now under relentless pressure from our military forces who are well equipped to effectively confront these enemies of humanity.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with my commitment to tackle the monster of terrorism head on, let me reassure these besieged communities and other Nigerians that this government will not abandon them to their fate because we are more than ever determined to get rid of these outlaws.\n\n\u201cThese criminals will be history because we are not going to relent in our current military operations to get rid of these thugs who have been terrorising innocent people.\n\n\u201cWe are fiercely determined to smoke out and destroy these outlaws who have no regard for the sanctity of life.\u201d\n\nThe president sympathised with the survivors and families of the victims.\n\n\u201cThe Army and the Air Force are working together to get rid of these callous criminals as they acquire more equipment to track down and eliminate criminal gangs that are subjecting innocent people to the reign of terror, including illegal imposition of taxes on the communities under siege,\u201d the statement added.\n\nNorthern Govs Back Deployment of Super Tucano Jets against Bandits\n\nMeanwhile, the governors of the 19 northern states of the federation have lauded the federal government for approving the deployment of the newly acquired Super Tucano fighter jets to rout the bandits in some parts of the country.\n\nGovernor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, who is also the Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, made the commendation when he addressed State House correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Buhari in Abuja at the weekend.\n\nHe expressed the happiness of the Northern states over the recent declaration of bandits as terrorists by the government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, in terms of security, we are already beginning to see progress on some of the issues we raised with the president last year; you recall that we have been very eager to see the use of the Tucano helicopters so that we can have massive engagement with all the bandits.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem was also the status of the bandits and already, you can see that the Nigerian government has declared them as a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cSo, the military is now going to do full engagement and we are also getting prepared in the North for such actions.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are expecting so if we are going to take action, let it be massive and such that will ensure that within the first quarter of this year, people will have hope of their security and peaceful living in all parts of the North.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed the need for drastic measures against the bandits and other criminals, saying such actions had become imperative to ensure a conducive environment for farmers to boost food production across the states.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting this action before the next rainy season. You recall we mentioned that we are an agrarian society so, we want our people to go back to farm and, in most cases, it is this insecurity that is keeping them away from the farms,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reiterated that the governors would continue to collaborate with traditional rulers and local vigilantes to safeguard their domains.\n\nMeanwhile, troops of 5 Brigade, Sector 3 Joint Task Force (JTF) of Operation Hadin Kai have killed three terrorists in a market in Damasak, Borno State.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by the Nigerian Army said troops clashed with the terrorists in an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari Village.\n\nThe statement signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said three fighters of the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP) were neutralised in the market during a gun duel.\n\n\u201cTroops, while consolidating on their dogged push to deplete Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province Terrorists (ISWAP) in Borno State, recorded a decisive victory against the terrorists in Damask on Friday, January 7, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe gallant troops, while conducting clearance operations, code-named Operation Dominance I, came in contact with the terrorists at an illegal market operated by the terrorists in Gallo Malawari Village\u201d, it said.\n\n\u201cIn the fierce encounter, three BH/ISWAP terrorists were neutralised, while others, bowing to superior firepower retreated in disarray,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement further stated that troops recovered one AK-47 rifle, a truck, two motorcycles, four empty magazines and rounds of 7.62mm ammunition among others.\n\nFG Seeks Divine Intervention to End Security Challenges\n\nIn a related development, the federal government has said that the fight against insecurity and other challenges would need divine intervention.\n\nThe Minister of State for Agriculture, Mr. Mustapha Babai, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari at the National Prayer Session for Nigeria, organised yesterday by the Kano State Government, said the current administration has been up and doing to overcome the security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government had not rested on its oars in supporting security personnel with needed equipment and welfare in a bid to bring the insecurity to an end.\n\n\u201cDespite the support, there is a need to seek divine intervention for the Almighty to bring an end to the challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, for taking the giant spiritual commitment towards making Nigeria peaceful.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with this initiative. Indeed Ganduje is doing well in securing Kano and in giving his quota to achieving peace in the country at large.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, Nigeria is facing security challenges and we are doing our best to support the security personnel. That does not mean we should not seek divine intervention. This prayer session is part of the interventions and I commend the state governor for this,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Ganduje thanked President Buhari for his efforts to ensure Kano remains peaceful by deploying security agents to secure the state.\n\nSaraki Condemns Killing of over 200 in Zamfara\n\nIn another development, former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has condemned the carnage perpetrated by terrorists in Zamfara State, where over 200 people were massacred.\n\nSaraki disclosed that during the #SaveBagega lead poisoning crisis in 2013, he visited the people of Anka Local Government Area of the state, where he met a determined and resilient community that worked hard to build a buoyant local economy.\n\nHe lamented that the same vibrant community has become a place of carnage and called for long-lasting solutions to the security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to the families and communities that have experienced the tragic loss and injury of loved ones, the destruction of their property, and the interruption of their livelihoods.\n\n\u201cToday, as we all mourn these terrible attacks in both Anka and Bukkuyum LGAs in Zamfara State, we owe the families and all other affected communities across the nation a brighter future.\n\n\u201cIn January 2013, during the #SaveBagega lead poisoning crisis, I spent some time with the people of Anka LGA, Zamfara. There I met a determined and resilient community that worked hard to build a buoyant local economy.\n\n\u201cToday, that same vibrant community has become a place of carnage. My heart is heavy, and truly there\u2019s anger too because we cannot continue like this. We must find long-lasting solutions to this insecurity. We will In sha Allah.\n\n\u201cI believe that this brighter future is possible because I have experienced first-hand the desire and enthusiasm that the people in Anka, Bukkuyum, and other similar communities have shown for a better life and a more secure future,\u201d Saraki explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Buni-led committee meets Tuesday\n\n\u2022To submit convention schedule to Buhari this week\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFollowing the uncertainty over the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which has tentatively been scheduled for February, a crucial meeting of the governors elected under the platform of the party will hold today to decide whether the exercise will hold or be postponed.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had directed the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State to immediately prepare the timetable for the national convention.\n\nThe Buni-led committee will meet on Tuesday to prepare a schedule for the convention, which will be submitted to the president this week.\n\nAlso, amid the alleged claim that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has zoned its 2023 presidential ticket to the northern part of the country, the main opposition party yesterday restated that it had not zoned the ticket to any zone.\n\nWhile some leaders of the APC such as the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu had urged Buni\u2019s committee to postpone the National Convention to enable the conclusion of the nationwide reconciliation, others, including the Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, had written the party leadership, insisting that shifting the convention would destroy the party.\n\nWith Buhari\u2019s directive that the Buni-led committee should submit clear details of the convention, the committee will meet on Tuesday to prepare the timetable and submit it to the president before Friday.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting of the governors, THISDAY learnt, will set the stage for the emergence of the presidential candidate of the party, the party\u2019s national chairman and the gubernatorial candidates in the states.\n\nA source close to the APC governors told THISDAY yesterday that the governors were divided on the issue of holding the convention next month.\n\nAccording to him, some of the governors wanted the exercise to hold next month to ensure that reconciliations that may arise after the convention are fully addressed before next year\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cSome APC governors are of the view that there is enough time to give 21 days\u2019 notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and hold the convention in February 2022.\n\n\u201cBut other governors argue that the exercise should be postponed because there are crises in the states and the state executives are yet to be inaugurated. These governors are of the view that all the crises should be resolved before the convention,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe source acknowledged that there are over 80 factions of the APC within the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cwe have crises in Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Rivers, Kwara, Kano, Lagos, Ogun, Zamfara and other states.\u201d\n\nHe further disclosed that the Ogun State chapter alone has three factions.\n\n\u201cThe crisis rocking the Ogun State chapter of the party is mainly between the group loyal to Senator Ibikunle Amosun, and the faction led by Governor Dapo Abiodun which enjoys the confidence of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cThe third group in the state is loyal to former governor Aremo Olusegun Osoba, which isn\u2019t affiliated yet to any of the two mainstream groupings. Lagos State chapter has five factions.\n\n\u201cThe Ekiti State chapter of the party is also embroiled in factional crisis but the matter has become sub-judice, considering that the faction loyal to APC National Leader, Senator Bola Tinubu, is already in court, against the mainstream faction, loyal to Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\n\u201cThere are factions in Zamfara State led by former Governor Yari and Senator Marafa on one side and the governor, Mr. Matawalle Bello on the other side.\n\n\u201cWe have a factional crisis in Delta and Anambra States. We also have many pending court cases and some governors believe that all these should be addressed before the National Convention,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe further disclosed that following President Buhari\u2019s directive, the Buni-led committee will meet on Tuesday to prepare the timeline for the convention as requested by the president.\n\n\u201cIf the draft timetable is easily acceptable, a National Executive Committee (NEC) would be summoned and the zoning arrangement would be settled,\u201d the source added.\n\nHe explained that the publicity, venue, accreditation finance and other committees would easily be addressed, adding that \u201call these depend on the outcome of the two meetings on Sunday (today) and Tuesday.\u201d\n\nWe Have Not Zoned Presidential Ticket, PDP Tells Aliyu, Others\n\nMeanwhile, following the alleged claim that the PDP has zoned its 2023 presidential ticket to the northern part of the country, the main opposition party yesterday restated that it had not zoned the ticket to any zone.\n\nA former Governor of Niger State, Dr. Babangida Aliyu was quoted as telling the members of the Atiku Support Organisation on Friday that the PDP had zoned its presidential ticket to the northern part of the country.\n\nAliyu had reportedly told the members of the organisation who visited him in Minna that he was confident of the success of the group, stressing that the party\u2019s decision was a result of the requests of members.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, in a statement issued yesterday, completely debunked the claims.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u20182023: We Have Not Zoned Our Presidential Ticket \u2013PDP,\u2019 the party said: \u201cIts attention has been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that our party has zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is completely misleading as it does not in any way represent the position of our party.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is a political party founded on democratic principles and every action of the party, including zoning, is based on extensive consultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues as well as the various tendencies and interests across the nation, with the main objective of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-existence and development of our nation are reinforced and promoted.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, therefore, urges Nigerians, our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. Our party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thanks Nigerians across the board for the overwhelming interest they have in our party as their sure platform to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule and urges them to remain united and focused as we join forces for the task ahead,\u201d the statement by Olugunagba explained.\n\nMany northern governors and the 17 southern governors had thrown their weight behind the clamour for power shift to the southern part of the country in 2023 to ensure justice and fair play.\n\nSome of the northern governors include Professor Babagana Zulum (Borno); Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina); Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna); Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano); Samuel Ortom (Benu) and Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), among others.\n\nThe southern governors under the leadership of the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had also, irrespective of political affiliation, given a strong position that power \u201cmust move to the South in 2023.\u201d\n\nSince 1999 when democracy returned under this dispensation, former President Olusegun Obasanjo governed from (1999-2007); the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (2007 \u2013 2010); former President Goodluck Jonathan (2010-2015); and President Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023).\n\nWith the north completing eight years in 2023, it is expected that power will shift to the south.\n\nHowever, some politicians from the north are working hard to retain power beyond 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nTo end the environmental menace occasioned by black soot in Rivers State, Governor Nyesom Wike, has tasked the state police command to collaborate with other security agencies, council chairmen and traditional rulers to arrest those involved in crude oil theft for prosecution.\n\nThe governor said the illegal bunkering and artisanal refining leading to black soot in the environment was endangering the health of residents of the state.\n\nWike gave the charge at a dinner and award night for officers of the Rivers State Police Command, held at the Police Officers Mess, Port Harcourt.\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, Emeka Woke, the governor declared that the state government had resolved to tackle those involved in crude oil theft and refining.\n\nWike stated that the state government was willing to provide the police and other security agencies all that would be required to dislodge and end the activities of artisanal refiners in the state.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cthe state is prepared to fight them more than ever before.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that since the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Friday Eboka assumed duties last year, Rivers State has witnessed peace and improved policing.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder the crime index in the state has reduced drastically. We thought we are the only people witnessing it, but with the award you got from the wife of the Inspector General of Police, it is an eloquent testimony that what we are seeing as a state, is also being observed from all the nation.\u201d\n\nThe governor said policing in Rivers State has improved remarkably because the management of the Nigeria Police Force at the Force Headquarters and the State Command, respectively distanced themselves from politics.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we will continue to support the security agencies in the state. Our support for security agencies is not only centered on Police Force. We are also extending similar gesture to the Navy, Air force and others.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe the primary function of any responsible government is to protect life and property. So, we have no option than to continue to support in providing logistics and everything that can make the security agencies in the State to function very well.\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that if our people are safe and the life here is peaceful, there will be increase in economics activities and the Internally Generated Revenue will also go up.\u201d\n\nWike commended the CP for discharging his duties professionally.\n\nHe, however, announced N1million reward for each of the recipients of the Rivers State Police Command award and N10 million to the command for organising the event.\n\nSpeaking, Commissioner of Police, Eboka explained that 2021 was a remarkable year for the command because Rivers State emerged as one of the most peaceful state in Nigeria.\n\nHe thanked Almighty God for his grace and Inspector General of Police for choosing Rivers State as the venue for the launching of South-South Operation Restore Peace.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis came with the deployment of special forces with sophisticated equipment as well as combat helicopter to the state\u201d.\n\nHe commended Governor Wike for being very phenomenal in the attainment of peace and security in the state.\n\n\u201cSince my assumption of office, the command has received more than 50 patrol vehicles fitted with modern gadgets from the State government. This gesture alone enhanced visibility policing in the state.\n\n\u201cRecall too, when we lost men to miscreants in sometimes April 2021, the governor did not allow us to suffer alone.

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) generated approximately N938.5 million from fees collected from importers of generators and other internal revenue sources from June 2020 to June\n\n2021, an analysis of the data for the four quarters provided by the industry regulator, has shown.\n\nNERC had in 2013 introduced a N25,000 charge per unit of 100KVA generator imported into the country in its guidelines for obtaining clearance certificate for the importation of generating sets and related matters.\n\nIt also fixed a charge of N3,500 per unit of between 25kva and 100kva generators imported into the country, while generators between 5kva and 25kva attract a charge of N1,000 per unit.\n\nFurthermore, it resolved to begin the collection of N250 per unit of between 2.5kva and 5kva, while between 0.45 Kva and 2.5 Kva generators attract a charge of N150 per unit.\n\nThe amount collected by NERC is exclusive of duties and other taxes paid by the importers in the country.\n\nNigeria still relies largely on generating sets to power its over $400 billion economy.\n\nThe Lagos State government had in October 2021 revealed that as a result of the country\u2019s inefficient and over-centralised electricity supply system, residents of the state alone, generated over 4,500MW daily through the use of generators.\n\nDetails of the financial position of the NERC showed that in the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, the IGR from fees arising from the importation of generator sets , licence processing and licencing fee was N431 million.\n\nA breakdown of the amount showed that N20.23 million was generated in April, N160.79 million in May and N250.25 million in June of that year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2021, NERC raked in N126.53 million, broken down into N50.80 million, N28.13 million and N47.60 million in January, February and March, respectively.\n\nAn analysis of the last six months of 2020 showed that in the third quarter of 2020, covering July, August and September, the industry regulator made N276.31 million from the same sources, segmented into\n\nN71.10 million, N111.11 million and N94.10 million, in the three months.\n\nSimilarly, in the last three months of 2020, NERC raked in N104.88 million from import fee imposed on the sale of generating sets, among others.\n\nHowever, the total operating levy received from market charges were N4.868 billion for Q2,2021 and N5.061 billion for Q1,2021. Total revenue for the period was N5.299 billion and N5.18 billion respectively, with personnel cost gulping N1 billion and N1.88 billion respectively.\n\nBefore then, in the last six months of 2020, operating levy was N2.64 billion for Q3 and N2.19 billion for Q2, with personnel cost standing at N843 million and N1.17 billion for the two quarters.\n\nBut the commission\u2019s total expenditure profile for the period was N6.1 billion shared into N1.6, N1.0 billion, N2.0 billion and N1.44 billion for the period spanning June 2020 to June 2021.\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter under review (Q2,2021), the total revenue realized by the commission was N5.30 billion, about 2.12 per cent higher than the N5.19 billion revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\n\u201cThere was a 230 per cent rise in other internally generated revenue while the operating levy (i.e., market charges) recorded a decline of 3.75 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe higher revenue recorded in 2021/Q2 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the commission stood at N1.44 billion which is lower than the N2.01 billion incurred during the first quarter of 2021,\u201d NERC stated.\n\nFor Q3, 2020, it pointed out that the total revenue that accrued to the commission was N2.93 billion, representing an increase of 31 per cent from the revenue recorded in the second quarter and a decrease of 10 per cent from the revenues recorded in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the improvement in revenues, the commission\u2019s expenditure declined to N1.05 billion in the quarter from N1.36 billion in the second quarter and N1.94billion in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, liabilities also declined to N123 million from N218 million in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe observed decline in expenditure was due largely to the reduction in operating activities of the\n\ncommission as a result of the Covid-19 movement restriction imposed by the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nAs for the summary of the commission\u2019s revenue and expenditure during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, it stated that the total revenue realised by the commission N1 .95 billion, about 33.35 per\n\ncent lower than the revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\nNERC noted that the higher revenue recorded in 2020/Q3 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees, the grant received from Mac-Arthur foundation and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\nNonetheless, it stressed that both the operating levy (i.e., market charges) and other IGR such as licencing fee charged by the commission declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe operating levy and IGR respectively declined by 30.36 per cent and 62.04 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2020. During the some period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the\n\ncommission stood at N1.60 billion which is higher than the N1.05 billion incurred during the third quarter of 2020.\n\nA comparison of the revenue and expenditure of the commission within the fourth quarter of 2020, it stated, indicated lesser expenditure incurred when compared to actual cash receipts.\n\nNERC explained however that there was a positive net cash flow of N347.47 million during the period. \u201cHowever, the total liabilities as at the end of the quarter stood at N419.68million,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Say date in February still possible as 5 disgruntled members beg Abuja court for restraining order\n\n*Party set to deal with recalcitrant followers\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja, Charles Ajunwa in Lagos\n\nThe Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have summoned an emergency meeting in Abuja tomorrow to pick a date for the party\u2019s National Convention, in line with the advice of President Muhammadu Buhari that the party should put its house in order to avoid being kicked out by the opposition in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, who disclosed this yesterday after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said \u201cthe party is still hopeful that a date in February is still feasible for the convention\u201d during which new national officers of the party would be elected.\n\nIn a related development, five aggrieved members of the APC have commenced legal action in Abuja, seeking an order to stop the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, from going ahead with the convention. This is the latest in the series of court cases rocking the party.\n\nLalong said the President\u2019s warning to the party that it risks losing power to the opposition, including the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), was a signal to the APC to have a seamless convention \u201cso that it will not disintegrate.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the President\u2019s warning was for the party to redouble its efforts and do the needful.\n\nLalong said: \u201cYou know when convention is coming, there will be fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work,some will say it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday, we will tell you when we\u2019re holding the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think during our first date before Christmas, we said we\u2019re going to do the convention in February and we are still working on it. As far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThe President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own; the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing its own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, are also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to keep our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is about interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\u201d\n\nLalong further assured that the meeting scheduled for tomorrow would address all the contending issues affecting the conduct of the convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping; that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss, I have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party, because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government.\u201d\n\nOn whether the several court cases pending against the party and its leadership will not abort plans of the convention, the governor said: \u201cThere are procedures for holding court processes. Many of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court. So, it\u2019s still the duty of the party, it\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court processes before you go to the convention. I don\u2019t think so because there are also machineries for resolving court processes, even after convention. I had a court process in my state, that did not stop me from going on and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC would meet the speculated February 5 date for the convention in view of the need for mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lalong said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday. Just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusions now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already talking of litigation, you draw conclusions, somebody will go and file a case tomorrow. So, I don\u2019t want us to draw a conclusion on that, but I want to assure you that we are meeting. We already sampled the minds of many of the governors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to get a date and then with the admonition given by the President, it\u2019s a warning signal to all of us to sit up and ensure that we have a seamless, very clean, fair and transparent convention so that our party will not get disintegrated.\u201d\n\nAggrieved Members Move to Stop Convention\n\nFive aggrieved members of the APC yesterday commenced legal action to stop the planned National Convention of the party by dragging the CECPC, under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, before a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe aggrieved members want the court to issue an order restraining the Buni-led CECPC from going ahead with the convention.\n\nRecall that some members of the APC are clamouring for a change in date of the scheduled national convention.\n\nThe suit dated January 4, 2022, has as plaintiffs, Suleiman Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel.\n\nThe APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were listed as 1-3 defendants in the court processes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are praying the court for an order to stop the convention on the grounds that state congresses are yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nLawyer to the plaintiffs, Olusola Ojo raised five questions for the court to determine and also sought eight declarative reliefs.\n\nOne of the reliefs included \u201can order of this Court restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from organising and conducting the national convention of the 1st defendant unless state congresses of the 1st defendant were first concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nAPC Set to Deal With Erring Members\n\nWith the National Convention of the APC being threatened by a plethora of crises, the ruling party may have resolved to come down hard on some erring members to ensure discipline and position the APC to retain power in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAPC\u2019s planned disciplinary actions are said to be fully supported by President Buhari who wants to leave behind a peaceful and united party in 2023.\n\nAccording to the President, the ruling party would shoot itself in the foot if \u201cit fails to resolve the disunity and lack of agreement amongst members of the party.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the decision of the party to sanction some erring members is in tandem with the President\u2019s position to instill discipline within the party.\n\nA source close to the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, who preferred anonymity, said the APC was considering \u201cvery serious and severe disciplinary measures against some people whose activities and utterances are threats to the health of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cI can tell you categorically that the party is coming down heavily on some party members whose actions are becoming dangerous for the unity of the party. Some of the individuals involved are high-profile.\n\n\u201cI am aware of two governors that have been pencilled down for disciplinary action. One is from the North-west while the other is from the South-west. The governors are said to be throwing stones at the party through their agents. Also, two former governors who are working against the APC secretly have been identified and will be sanctioned at the appropriate time. Also, some Senators and House of Representatives members are fingered in a secret report at the disposal of the party.\n\n\u201cA minister from the South-east was also said to have been working against the interest of the party. The party may soon unmask these characters and deal decisively with them.\u201d\n\nThe source further said \u201ca meeting will be scheduled shortly to address this matter.\u201d\n\nAccording to insiders at the party\u2019s headquarters, the desperation of some individuals, especially aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the party, and groups within the APC remain a big threat to the peace and stability of the party.\n\nAnother highly ranked member of the party, who does not want his name mentioned, wondered why some aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the APC want to \u201cderail the party at this critical period instead of helping to build it and consolidate on the gains so far achieved by the Buhari government.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThere has to be APC first for these aspirants to realise their aspirations. APC is a big family and it has the capacity to accommodate all interests. Buni is working tirelessly to hold the party together and he needs the support of every stakeholder in order to take the party to greater heights. Buni is not contesting for the party\u2019s chairmanship seat. He will be seeking reelection in Yobe State as second term governor.\n\n\u201cSome political parties have predicted that APC will implode. But I have good news for them \u2013 APC will never implode. It\u2019s one united family. We have internal mechanisms we use in settling matters with dispatch. APC is the party to beat in 2023.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a group within the APC called Progressive Initiative For Change and Development has called on the leadership of the APC to ensure all crises in the party are resolved amicably before any National Convention is conducted.\n\nThe National Coordinator of the Group, Chief Donatus Okereke told journalists in Abuja that the party was clearly not ready for a National Convention with the crisis engulfing some state chapters, urging the national leaders of the party to ensure \u201cproper and thorough reconciliation\u201d before any National Convention is staged.\n\nPGF DG Calls for Buni\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Director General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Lukman Salihu has called on Buni and the Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe to resign honourably if they can\u2019t conclude preparations for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nLukman stated this in a letter dated January 5, 2022 titled, \u201cAPC National Convention: Urgent Matters for the Survival of APC,\u201d and addressed to the Chairman of PGF and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\n\nThe director-general also copied President Buhari and key party leaders in the letter which was sighted by THISDAY.\n\nLukman recalled that on Monday, January 3, 2022, he sent an open letter to all APC leaders titled \u201cPlausibility of February 2022 APC Convention\u201d, which highlighted some of the reasons the APC National Convention should not be postponed.\n\nThe party chieftain pointed out that leaders of the party must understand that the survival of the party was at stake and any attempt to continue to contemplate postponement of the Convention means gambling with the future of the party, which he said was unacceptable.\n\nThe party chieftain said the failure of the Buni-led Committee to implement decisions makes APC leaders complicit and therefore agreeable to acts that are injurious to the survival of the party.\n\nAccording to him, the insinuation in the public is that the reluctance of Buni to proceed with implementation of the decision to hold the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 as agreed was because governors want to continue to control the party, which to the best of my knowledge is not true.\n\nLukman stressed that some commentators both within the party and in the public have argued that there are deliberate efforts to prevent the convention from holding on February 5, 2022, which was why the CECPC did not make any public announcement or begin to make any preparation.\n\nThe director-general said that APC leaders should imagine the consequences of ruining the electoral potentials of the party in 2023 such that beyond losing the federal government, self-implicated legal challenges are created to weaken the electoral prospects of the party simply because of actions or inactions of the CECPC, especially Buni and Akpanudoedehe.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Ex-President Jonathan's Ambition To Retake Power In 2023 Hits Setback As Former Appointees Fail To Support Move Over Distrust For Buhari",
          "text": "The ambition of Ex-Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, to succeed incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, may have hit a major barrier as his former aides and appointees whom he was strongly relying on for support have turned their backs against him, SaharaReporters reliably gathered.\n\nThe newspaper had earlier reported how President Buhari shunned former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to support Jonathan\u2019s ambition.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan\n\nBuhari, it was reliably gathered reached out to Jonathan on taking over power from him and was already working with some of his most trusted lieutenants to actualise this plan.\n\nA trusted source around the President had told SaharaReporters that the idea had already received the backing of some prominent politicians from the North including state governors as the arrangement will enable power to return to the region in 2027 when Jonathan would have served out his single four-year term after previously occupying same position from 2011 to 2015.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Shuns Tinubu, Osinbajo To Support Ex-President Jonathan\u2019s 2023 Election Ambition To Pave Way For North To Reclaim Power In 2027\n\nTo show commitment to this plan, the President Buhari administration had secretly released funds seized from Jonathan's wife, Patience, back to her.\n\nThe meeting between both men recently in Also Rock Villa was said to have centred on plans to achieve the 2023 plan on Jonathan returning as Nigeria's President.\n\nBut in a swift turn of events, the table appears to have turned against Jonathan as his former ministers and retired military chiefs have expressed unwillingness to support his ambition.\n\nA reliable source close to the former Nigerian President told SaharaReporters that his ex-appointees regard him as being too weak as a leader, and that they do not trust Buhari, who they feel was only deceiving Jonathan to actualise a Northern agenda.\n\nThe source said, \u201cHis former ministers and retired military chiefs are already against the move.

          "text": "All appears not to be well with the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos as his government continues to score low in terms of public perception following the poor handling of certain issues in the state in recent times.\n\nSince taking over office in 2019 from Akinwunmi Ambode, former governor of Lagos, Sanwo-Olu and his government had struggled to carve out a glittering image in the public space, moving from one embarrassment to another over this period.\n\nThe latest episode of this uninspiring trend came last Wednesday following the issuance of a controversial legal advice to the police in Lagos by the Director, Directorate of Public Prosecutions, Ms Adetutu Oshinusi, which exonerated five students and officials of Dowen College, Lekki, suspected to be linked to the death of a student, Sylvester Oromoni.\n\nSee Also Politics Lagos Government Replaces Justice Ministry Official Who Exonerated Dowen College Staff, Students Over Sylvester Oromoni\u2019s Death\n\nOromoni died on November 30, 2021 following ill-health said to have been caused by bullying by senior students.\n\nThe 12-year-old boy\u2019s father had claimed that his child was beaten and forced to drink a chemical that eventually claimed his life.\n\nBut management of Dowen College had dismissed the claim, alleging that the boy sustained injuries while playing football with colleagues.\n\nThe position of the school attracted stiff criticisms from Nigerians and forced the police to arrest the five students and officials while it carried out an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe Lagos Government also announced the indefinite closure of the school pending the outcome of the findings.\n\nHowever, the release of the students and staff of Dowen College following Oshinusi's legal advice further escalated issues on Wednesday as Nigerians not only condemned the exoneration of the 10 persons but also accused the Lagos Government of trying to sweep the matter under the carpet in a bid to protect the influential cronies.\n\nTop sources within the state government confirmed to SaharaReporters that the development not only caused Governor Sanwo-Olu's administration great embarrassment but further dented its perception in the eyes of the public.\n\nAdetutu Oshinusi\n\nIn response, the state government immediately moved Oshinusi out of the Ministry of Justice as Director of the DPP to Directorate of Citizens Rights.\n\nA former Head, Office of the Public Defender, Dr Babajide Martins, was named as an immediate replacement for that position.\n\nTo further exorcise the ghost of that move considered as a huge blunder by the state government, Oshinusi was not mentioned as the outgoing DPP in a memo by the administration.\n\nInstead, a former occupant of the role, who had since been made a judge of the Lagos High Court, Adenrera Olayinka Adeyemi, was named as Martins' predecessor as DPP director.\n\nThe state government, SaharaReporters further gathered, was doing everything possible to distance Sanwo-Olu's administration from the controversial legal advice in order to improve the public image of the government.\n\n\u201cHer (Oshinusi) role was so despicable that the government had to deny that she was never the Director, Directorate of Public Prosecutions.\n\n\"If you check the memo signed by Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary of the state, Ms Titilayo Shitta-Bey, one Adenrera Olayinka Adeyemi, who is now a judge of the High Court of Lagos State, was named as the DPP.\n\n\"She (Oshinusi) was quickly redeployed to the Directorate of Citizens Rights after the report.\n\n\"The entire development greatly embarrassed the Lagos State Government and that was why they reacted quickly and are looking for every means to distance the administration from the legal advice from Oshinusi,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nIt was further gathered that the sanctioning of a coroner's inquest into Oromoni's death as demanded by lawyer to the victim's family, Femi Falana, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, was part of moves by the Lagos Government to correct the 'error' by Oshinusi and appear non-partisan in the entire saga.\n\nIndeed, the latest embarrassment for Sanwo-Olu's administration comes a little over a year after his government faced heavy backlash for deploying soldiers from Bonny Camp in Lagos to massacre young Nigerians demanding an end to police brutality and improved governance in the country at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nBrig. Gen. Ahmed Ibrahim Taiwo of 81 Division Intelligence Brigade while appearing before the Lagos Judicial Panel in November 2020 alleged that Sanwo-Olu called on the military for support that fateful day after the #EndSARS crisis degenerated into chaos.\n\nTestifying before the panel, General Taiwo had said, \"On October 20, 2020, Lagos State descended into anarchy.\n\n\"Sanwo-Olu asked the army to intervene and that was the correct thing to do since the police had been overrun.\"\n\nMore than 10 persons were killed while scores more remain unaccounted for following the attack on the peaceful protesters by the soldiers.\n\nSanwo-Olu and his government denied any involvement in the massacre till date despite the testimony of the military.\n\nOne year after that mass killing, Governor Sanwo-Olu in a desperate bid to repair his government's public image called for a 'peace walk' in commemoration of the Lekki incident.\n\nThe Lagos governor had invited some prominent young entertainers and activists including musician Folarin 'Falz' Falana, comedian Debo Adebayo widely known as Mr Marcaroni, another musician Seun Kuti, among others to join him on the walk.\n\nBut the invited youth all turned down the request by Sanwo-Olu, forcing him to cancel the planned 'peace walk'.\n\nThe Lagos governor and his administration further suffered embarrassment last week when the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, and Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, deployed a team of policemen from Abuja to lay siege to the disputed Magodo Phase 2 Estate in Lagos without consulting with him.\n\nResidents had prevented entry into the estate after some persons in company with policemen tried to enforce a Supreme Court judgment giving them authorisation over the land the estate now sits on.\n\nThe situation had generated much controversy that residents staged a protest in front of the estate to draw government's attention to the situation.\n\nVisiting the estate to intervene in the crisis and dismiss the policemen from Abuja from the area, Governor Sanwo-Olu and his officials were 'splashed with mud' in the face when leader of the police team, Abimbola Oyewole, a Chief Superintendent of Police, refused to obey his order to leave the place.\n\nAfter attempting several times to have Oyewole and his men disengage and leave the area, the Lagos governor left the scene in disappointment.\n\nInside sources told SaharaReporters that the Lagos governor was greatly worried that these embarrassing incidents could further dent his chances of returning to office for a second term.\n\n\"His administration is suffering serious image crisis at the moment and there is concern that this could affect his chances of returning for a second term in office.\n\n\"Already, many Lagos residents have a poor perception of his administration, they think he is not sensitive to the plight of ordinary people, this could work against him.\n\n\"That is why his government is avoiding any type of scandal. This explains why the legal advice by the DPP angered the administration a lot,\" the source added.",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven to a casual observer, 2021 was a massive year for the African tech ecosystem. It was the year when there were more disclosed funding rounds than we could keep up with. Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021. That represents more than double the investments gotten in 2020.\n\nNumbers, they say, don\u2019t lie, and with help from Briter Bridges\u2019 Africa Investment Report 2021 and data from Africa: The Big Deal, we\u2019ll be extracting some insights.\n\nFunding for women-led startups needs to be better\n\nMuch has been written about the near absence of financing for women-led startups. While startup funding continues to grow, it is still disproportionately skewed towards startups led by men or at least one man on the founding team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdunayo Eweniyi, Co-founder, FirstCheck Africa\n\nThe Big Deal reports that only 0.95% of the funding raised by African startups went to startups founded or led by a woman. While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

In 2021, for instance, approximately $5 billion was raised by startups across the continent. Interestingly, this exceeded 2020\u2019s investment and is almost four times what was raised five years ago. This demonstrates how much the fintech space has evolved in recent years.\n\nMoreso, the fintech industry is reshaping and simplifying our lives. Who would have predicted a decade ago that Point of Sale (PoS), and mobile and Internet banking would be a part of our everyday lives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2021 was a great year for fintech startups, 2022 could hold more. What do you think? We don\u2019t know what 2022 will bring, but we can see the future by looking into the past.\n\nHere\u2019s Emmanuel Paul\u2019s take on that: Nigerian fintech predictions for 2022: Dollar exchanges go the way of Bitcoin.\n\nPlease read and leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nLinkedIn to launch a Clubhouse rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn, a professional network service, is launching a new events platform to list, host, and market interactive, virtual live events. It will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end without the need for any other third-party software.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means users can record and run the event directly from LinkedIn, featuring tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and moderate discussions. Attendees can also communicate with each other during and after events.\n\nThe new events platform will begin with an audio-only product \u2014 clubhouse-style audio events \u2014 released in beta this January. This will follow a video version that will be released in March 2022. However, it will be targeting users who use LinkedIn to connect with a larger audience.\n\nHave we seen this before? This is similar to Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, but with content geared towards career development, professional topics, and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.\n\nRemember that LinkedIn shut down Stories in September 2021, partly because LinkedIn discovered that users didn\u2019t want disappearing videos. In addition, Twitter, a social media giant, discontinued Fleets, its Stories-like product, in 2021. Twitter discovered that users did not respond to short videos in the way they had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, LinkedIn confirmed that it has been working on a Clubhouse rival to cultivate a larger and more active Creator community. Over the last year, the company has also been experimenting with other features that it may add to this events service, such as a paid, ticketed option which will be launched as a free service for the time being.\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce startup, JABU, has confirmed the closing of $3.2 million in seed funding to assist small retailers in ordering and stocking their products while also providing data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAfore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, among other unnamed investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nSuppliers who use the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators, and book merchandising. They can also run advertising and marketing campaigns, hold product giveaways, and generate merchandising revenue.\n\nIntriguingly, the company, which operates in three Namibian cities and has recently expanded into two Zambian cities, is planning a Series A fundraising round this quarter.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy 2022 Is the Year We Learn to Live With COVID-19.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2021 was an amazing trip for Nigerian fintechs, then 2022 could be a blast off to space. That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

          "title": "2022: Which way for Nigerians from here?",
          "text": "In the face of the current realities in the country, it will not be out of place to query what is actually wrong with the country.\n\nSonny Okosun, the late ace musician, also asked the question in an entire album he dedicated to the problem with Nigeria. The question and message of the album, \u2018Which way Nigeria\u2019, which he released in 1984, are still being asked today as the situation is getting worse.\n\nSadly, many Nigerians who have weathered the storms of 2021 seem not to have the enthusiasm that heralds a New Year, as there is no definite commitment by the country\u2019s leadership to make life better for them.\n\nBy July, barely six months from today, the country will experience the highest fuel pump price increase in history as the government had warned in late 2021 that fuel subsidy would be finally removed by the middle of 2022.\n\nAs expected, prices of commodities, especially food items will soar more, leaving more Nigerians hungry, while transport fares will more than double, impacting further on cost, and pushing inflation to an all-time high.\n\nCurrently, the inflation rate is about 15.99 percent, unemployment rate hit an all-time high of about 33.3 percent in 2021 from the previous record of 27.1 percent in early 2020, Naira is depreciating every day against major foreign currencies; oil price at the international market is not increasing as expected, while SMEs are starved of needed funds to stimulate the economy because of the unimaginable bank interest rate of 25 percent and above.\n\nAll the indices combined to offer a gloomy picture for the Nigerian economy in 2022, leaving the masses, who do not have stolen public funds, most vulnerable as prices of goods begin to increase, life becoming more unbearable, yet the government seems unconcerned.\n\nAlso, for the teeming unemployed graduates, their hope of getting white-collar jobs is already dashed as Muhammadu Buhari, president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on whose table the buck of formulating policies to create jobs stops, asked them not to look the way of the government and at most, he told them to go to the farm.\n\nBuhari, in an exclusive interview with Channels Television on Wednesday, bluntly told Nigerian youths not to rely on the Federal Government for jobs but to put their hard-earned degree to use by identifying problems and creating jobs, as well as, tapping from the large amount of arable and uncultivated land across the country.\n\n\u201cI wish when they go to school and earn their degrees they don\u2019t do it thinking the government must give them jobs; you get educated and you are certainly better than an illiterate even in identifying personal problems.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria\u2019s population, 35 years and below are the majority and they want the government to get jobs for them, and they do not care that only 2.5 percent of our arable land is cultivated. Our attention should be on agriculture,\u201d the President urged.\n\nReacting to prevailing circumstances and Buhari\u2019s position, Solomon Gbenga, deputy national youth leader of Young Progressives Party (YPP), said there was no hope of a better condition of life for Nigerians in 2022 and beyond.\n\nGbenga told BusinessDay that the President has clearly shown that there are no plans for the people and Nigerians are going to keep living the way they have been in the past six or seven years of his administration.\n\nThe YPP deputy national youth leader said Nigerians should at this point begin to know that their fate is in their hands and if given the opportunity again, they should never vote the APC or the PDP into power because both of them are birds of the same feathers.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the reality of time that our President is someone who doesn\u2019t understand the feelings of the people and doesn\u2019t know how to go about issues on ground anymore. For the President to have come out clearly to say that if you graduate it shouldn\u2019t be the yardstick for you to get a job then what is the essence of education\u201d? He asked.\n\nFor Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, 2022 will be a tough year for Nigerians if the people decide to keep quiet and die in silence.\n\n\u201c2022 should be a year to begin the process of righting wrongs because the 2023 election is at hand. First, get the politicians to fulfill their promises. If they borrow and say it was for infrastructure and refineries are not working, seaports are jam-packed, the railway is yet to impact, then stop them from borrowing more\u201d, he said. He argued that in a country blessed with huge crude oil and natural gas resources, there should have been concerted efforts at building many refineries to refine and supply petroleum products to West Africa, Africa and other parts of the world. \u201cWhy is the government not implementing practical solutions to subsidy, it is not removal, but giving license and encouraging private sectors to build more refineries to boost supply\u201d, he said.\n\nIfewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, thinks that the economic situation in the country will get worse if the government does not consciously and sustainably address the insecurity problem in 2022.\n\n\u201cNo businessman will risk his hard-earned investments in a troubled country like Nigeria. We talk about building more refineries to address the subsidy removal issue, but the government is not doing much to address insecurity and assure return on investment. The private refineries being built will always be targeted during crises as indigene-related issues will always come up\u201d, he explained.\n\nRead also: Sluggish electricity metering program creates path to extort, frustrate Nigerians\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of, People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), the main opposition, said President Buhari has nothing new to tell Nigerians, having run out of ideas on how to move the country forward.\n\nAyu, a former President of the Senate, in a reaction to the interview Buhari granted Channels Television said: \u201cTo expect anything new from our President would be a misplaced and unfortunate expectation.\n\n\u201cFrom the economy to insecurity, killing of innocent farmers by terrorists (which some erroneously termed farmer/herder clashes) and other sundry issues, President Buhari has nothing new to offer\u201d, Ayu said.\n\nAlslo, last Sunday, in his weekly column, \u2018Engagement by Chidi Amuta\u2019 in ThisDay, entitled: \u2018Unhappy New Year\u2019, Amuta, an erudite scholar and publicist, strongly believed that Nigerians may be in for a tough year.\n\nAmuta may have pre-empted President Muhammadu Buhari, who during his interview with the Channels Television Wednesday gave an indication that it was not going to be a happy new year for Nigerians after all.\n\nPart of his observations was that \u201cIn the New Year, Nigerians may be shocked how early in the new year their superstitious wishes for prosperity and happiness will turn into ashes or simply evaporate into thin air. In this place, even the best intentions of divine beneficence are soon thwarted by the machinations of bad or incompetent people.\n\n\u201cEarly in the New Year, President Buhari is likely to sign into law a senseless volume of silly figures and statistics called a budget. The volume, compiled by lazy bureaucrats, padded up by greedy legislators and delivered to a bemused nation by semi-literate politicians, is all the empowerment the executive branch needs to proceed on a spending binge.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cThat is the national budget which sensible citizens hardly spare a moment to read. The other 36 state governors and the Minister of the FCT follow suit in this futile annual ritual of public fraud. The public does not bother to take a look at the figures since they know the politicians will follow neither their own words nor implement the content of the silly documents.\n\n\u201cThe budget process in Nigeria is part of an elaborate ritual of collective deceit and mass hypnosis that goes in the name of governance in these parts\u201d, Amuta said.\n\nHe further stated that \u201cOrdinarily, happy New Year should have meant some relief from the existing gamut of explicit taxes on Nigerians. The implicit taxes are assumed. We provide our own security at home, in offices and even when we venture out of town to visit the places of our ancestry.\n\n\u201cPrivate fees for private security guards, rented police escorts, rented military escorts and private military companies are things that Nigerians pay for even though they have already been taxed by the government for the same services. Add all that to your private water supply, generators and first aid and primary healthcare.\u201d\n\nKunle Okunola, a public affairs analyst, said Nigerians are suffering because of bad and inexperienced leadership who refused to plan, adding that successive governments in the country have not shown any will to initiate people-oriented policies and implement them to the fullest.\n\nAccording to him,\u201d Nigerians are suffering because of incompetent leaders, for instance, why did it take Buhari about six years to appoint economy adviser? Why did it take him six months to appoint ministers?\n\n\u201cThis administration needs to commit herself to making robust people oriented policies and displaying sincere will to make it work.\n\nSpeaking further he said that this administration has failed in two regards in recent years and so it cannot be trusted in making and implementing with sincerity people\u2019s oriented policies.\n\n\u201cThis administration needs to march in action with its rhetoric so as to make the life of citizenry better in 2022. The fiscal and physical policies must be such that focus on redefining the state of the economy and having a positive effect on the economy and economic status of the poor masses\u201d.\n\nConsidering the imminent hardship, Gbenga observed that the crave for migration to other countries would continue and even increase in 2022 as the condition of life in the country would be worse as Buhari\u2019s interview signified.\n\n\u201cAny Nigerian youth, the first thing on their mind is to go and become a second class or third class citizen elsewhere rather than being a first class citizen where your life and property is not safe, where you are not sure of a better tomorrow. Nigerians now sleep and wake up in a situation of what should happen. It\u2019s already a bad omen for us.\n\n\u201cThe public already knows that there is no government that has the feeling of care for the people. It is now so bad that if you have your way as a Nigerian, the first thing you have to do is to leave the country and become a second class citizen. Being in Nigeria, it is either terrorists are coming for you, or lack of job or unemployment is coming your way. Even if you have a job, your poorly paid, it is as good as not having a job.\n\n\u201cSo if you see Nigerians migrating to the country, it is for the betterment of themselves and their families because a lot of people are living in abject poverty because of bad policies in place,\u201d Gbenga maintained.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s $1.4bn soft drink market to slow on Excise Tax",
          "text": "The Federal Government\u2019s Excise Duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sweetened beverages may threaten the growth of the industry that has maintained steady growth since 2016.\n\nAccording to a BusinessDay analysis of the off-trade sales for carbonated beverages in Nigeria by Euromonitor International, a London-based market research company, sales have been rising from $713.6 million in 2016 to $1.4billion in 2021. Similarly, its volumes have also risen to 1.6 billion litres from 1.4 billion litres.\n\nCarbonated beverages are popularly known as soft drinks like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Sprite, Bigi, Fanta, etc. Most players in the industry say that the Excise Duty might cause a dip in sales and volumes as beer makers are also complaining of high Excise Duty.\n\n\u201cThe Excise Duty of N10 might make them increase it to between N160 and N180 from N150. I don\u2019t support it because the money is not going to the beverage companies but the government, thus making their sales to be lower,\u201d Ibrahim Ahmed, an inventory manager at Coca-Cola Nigeria, said.\n\nAhmed said further that lower sales would make the companies less profitable thereby making them lay off staff.\n\nFood and beverage contributed the highest (38%) of the total manufacturing sector to the GDP. It comprises 22.5 percent of manufacturing jobs and generates more than 1.5 million jobs, according to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).\n\nIn 2019, Nigerian households spent N551.2 billion on non-alcoholic drinks, N205.5 billion on sugar, sweets, and confectionery, and N150.3 billion on alcoholic drinks, a National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report shows.\n\nMuda Yusuf, a former director-general of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said, \u201cThe introduction of Excise Duty is ill-timed, insensitive and most inappropriate given the prevailing harsh economic and business conditions.\n\n\u201cThe millions of micro-enterprises in the soft drinks\u2019 distribution chain will be adversely impacted by the imposition of the Excise Tax. This is detrimental to the job creation and poverty reduction commitment of President Buhari.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, director-general at MAN, said in a recent statement that introducing the duty would easily reduce production capacity, causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\n\nRead also: Soft drink tax to boost Nigeria\u2019s fight against obesity, diabetes\n\nHe also added that a decrease in production levels or the ability to purchase raw materials would result in reduced profits for the supply chain players in the non-alcoholic beverage sector.\n\nExcise Duty is a form of tax imposed on the production, licensing, and sale of goods. Before the announcement of this new Excise Duty, there have been rumours that the government would introduce it in 2019.\n\nAccording to the government, the new tax will help discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages that contributes to a number of health conditions including diabetes and obesity. And help raise excise duties and revenues for health-related and other critical expenditures.\n\n\u201cIt is not a crime to increase price but when government over-burdens people with taxes, it will reduce volume and thus affect profitability at the end and government may not realise the budget target on taxation,\u201d John Isemede, former director-general, National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), said.\n\nOver the past five years, soft drink makers have been competing for sales by increasing the quantity of products without increasing their prices due to weak purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBut last year, soft drink markers increased their prices twice due to a surge in international sugar prices, a major ingredient in the production of carbonated drinks.\n\n\u201cConsumption of soft drinks will reduce, making them opt for cheaper alternatives. So the producers are losing in two ways, the volumes and the extra price that they are charging,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, said.\n\nThe carbonated soft drink market commands a unique hold on the food and beverage sector in the Nigerian economy.\n\nDespite the huge popularity of the juice and drink market, the unique tasting appeals of carbonated soft drinks and its many arrays of flavours have always been a strength other drinks cannot match.\n\nNigeria\u2019s fast-growing population brings with it a continuing demand for soft drinks, especially as the climate is quite hot.\n\nAccording to Euromonitor International, the country ranked fourth globally in the volume of soft drink sales recorded in 2016.",
          "summary": "Most players in the industry say that the Excise Duty might cause a dip in sales and volumes as beer makers are also complaining of high Excise Duty.\n\u201cThe millions of micro-enterprises in the soft drinks\u2019 distribution chain will be adversely impacted by the imposition of the Excise Tax.\nThe carbonated soft drink market commands a unique hold on the food and beverage sector in the Nigerian economy.\nNigeria\u2019s fast-growing population brings with it a continuing demand for soft drinks, especially as the climate is quite hot.\nAccording to Euromonitor International, the country ranked fourth globally in the volume of soft drink sales recorded in 2016.",

          "title": "2023: Leave choice of successor to voters, Nigerians tell Buhari, governors",
          "text": "Nigerians have urged the outgoing state governors and President Muhammadu Buhari to accord the voting masses their constitutional right to choose who leads them in a democracy.\n\nThe call became necessary following President Buhari\u2019s disclosure last Wednesday that he was keeping close to his chest the name of his successor.\n\nSome state governors have also been quoted as saying that they know who would succeed them or that they were still waiting to hear from God the names of those to succeed them.\n\nSome Nigerians who spoke with BusinessDaySunday thought that the job of selecting/electing president and governors in a democracy must be the prerogative of the electorate as imposition or anointing of successors had bred rancour in the past and has also left the country poorly governed.\n\nNigerians are being regaled with stories emanating from seats of power about choosing successors.\n\nLast Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari, during an interview with the Channel Television said he had his own agenda regarding the person that would succeed him, but that he would be keeping that close to his chest until the days draw closer because he would not want the person eliminated before the time.\n\nA few days ago, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State said he was keeping the identity of his likely successor close to his chest and that he was yet to hear from God on the personality of his successor.\n\nGovernor Emmanuel took the seeming usurpation of voters\u2019 rights to a high level when he said: \u201cGod in due time will reveal his successor.\u201d\n\nIt would seem that the governor had foreclosed the role of voters and would be ready to ensure that he foists a successor on the people under the guise that such a person is the divine choice.\n\nThis mindset is common in Government Houses across the country, among the outgoing governors. And it is this mindset that seems to be making voters irrelevant in the electoral process in the country, resulting in increasing voter apathy.\n\nSince President Buhari\u2019s interview with Channels Television, one major question many Nigerians have continued to ask is whether it is the business of the President to choose a successor in a democracy.\n\nIt is a common practice to see outgoing governors and even presidents impose their successor on the people and their political parties in Nigeria. In most cases, since the candidate is \u2018anointed\u2019 by the governor they often win the primaries of their parties easily.\n\nIn several instances, such \u2018anointed\u2019 candidates do not have a challenger at the primaries mainly because the governors control the structure of the political parties in their states.\n\nIn the last two decades, the practice has attracted wide criticism among Nigerians and well-meaning individuals across the country, who say it is undemocratic.\n\nThey say in a democracy, it is a right of the people to choose their leaders by themselves, not someone else choosing for them, otherwise, such a person would only be loyal to his godfather and care less about the people when he assumes office.\n\nLogically, it is believed that outgoing governors impose their successor to cover their tracks after leaving office; some also want to protect their legacies. However, some governors have refused to follow the trend.\n\nSpeaking on the issue recently, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said the insistence to install a successor by any state chief executive had always been for selfish reasons.\n\n\u201cThe insistence to plant a successor is mainly for selfish reasons. Everyone with the right capacity should come forward to tell people why they should vote for him/her,\u201d Wike had said.\n\nSimilarly, several Nigerians who spoke in separate interviews on the issue said often non-performing or corrupt governors guilty of embezzling public funds are most guilty of the practice because saying they impose their stooge in office to shield themselves from being probed.\n\nThey noted that the problem with the practice is the tendency of having incompetent successors, answerable and loyal to their godfathers, taking office and perpetuating the cycle of unaccountability and gross non-performance in government.\n\nA Political Analyst, Gideon Ayogu described the practice as a misnomer and against the true spirit and ethos of democracy, saying it had contributed to bad governance in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe on-going practice in which governors attempt to impose their successor is prevalent here in Nigeria. However, it is a misnomer and against the true spirit and ethos of democracy. In most cases, the motive behind this practice is a selfish one as the majority of governors who engage in it are often non-performing or corrupt ones guilty of embezzling public funds and, as such, would rather plant or impose their lackeys or stooge in office to shield themselves from being probed.\n\n\u201cThe downside of this unwholesome practice is the tendency of having incompetent successors, answerable and/or loyal to their godfathers, taking office and perpetuating the cycle of unaccountability and gross non-performance in government.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing practice in which governors attempt to impose their successor is prevalent here in Nigeria. However, it is a misnomer and against the true spirit and ethos of democracy.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, the motive behind this practice is a selfish one as the majority of governors who engage in it are often non-performing or corrupt ones guilty of embezzling public funds and, as such, would rather plant or impose their lackeys or stooge in office to shield themselves from being probed.\n\nRead also: Agric growth under Buhari weakest since 1999 despite investment\n\nSpeaking further, he said aspirants should be allowed to test their popularity among the electorates.\n\n\u201cInterested candidates for political office must be allowed to test their popularity, while the electorate is equally given the ultimate decision on whether they succeed in taking office or not,\u201d he added.\n\nBy the same token, Tope Musowo, a public affairs analyst, said the practice had contributed to bad governance and the lukewarm attitude of elective office holders to fulfilling their campaign promises to the electorate.\n\nHe added that though few of them may not have bad intentions, they are just looking for an individual that would continue with their legacy.\n\n\u201cThe reason why some governors like to impose is to have someone who probably has been with them who knows all the atrocities they have committed and who is \u2018loyal\u2019 enough to cover their tracks. Some do that because they want someone who will consolidate on their achievements.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSometimes, four or eight-year tenure is not enough to really build for sustainable development. You can only lay the foundation or prepare the blueprint for others to build on. The fear of many governors who want to impose their successor on the people is having a good hand, who can continue where they stop without deviating from the master plan\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, Ola Ogundimu, who is a teacher, said the practice should be discouraged though it is becoming a norm in the country, because it is undemocratic.\n\n\u201cIt is bad and killing our democracy, you can see the way such people behave when they get to office, check from the record most of them are failures. Whichever, whatever reason that might inform that, it is still undemocratic, in a democracy, it is right for the people to choose their leaders by themselves, not someone else choosing for them,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not out of place for outgoing presidents and governors to anoint successors by way of suggesting to the voting masses to look in a certain direction for a good successor.\n\nFor instance, when the former President Olusegun Obasanjo was leaving office in 2003, he anointed the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua as his successor. He also went ahead to manipulate the electoral process to favour his choice candidate. The scar of that electoral malfeasance is all over the Nigerian body polity.\n\nThe emergence of Goodluck Jonathan, who was obviously unprepared for the position when it was thrusted at him, also became a huge burden on Nigeria.\n\nFrom being a vice president, Jonathan became president following the demise of Yar\u2019Adua. But Jonathan lost his second term bid after his popularity plummeted.\n\n\u201cAnointing a successor is more dangerous when the incumbent is seen as a non-performer and the people are eagerly awaiting his/her exit from the power stool. To think of replicating him/herself rankles,\u201d Lanre Ode, a political scientist, said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis appears to be the feeling of many Nigerians who believe that the President should leave the job of getting his successor with them to decide.\u201d\n\nOde recalled that President Buhari ascended the power stool with a wild ovation. He was seen as a messiah and integrity personified.\n\n\u201cAlthough some Nigerians had warned the country that a vote for the Katsina-born former military ruler was tantamount to self-surrender to a life of slavery, the voting masses were so fed up with the Jonathanian administration that they believed anybody would be better than the Bayelsa-born politician.\n\n\u201cMoreover, many thought that Buhari, who had contested the Presidency for three times before 2015, must have had a good plan laid out on how to turn Nigeria into a paradise.\n\n\u201cToday, close to seven years after he was elected President, the country appears to have grown worse in every sense of the word and in all departments.\n\n\u201cIt is so bad now that some people have already begun a countdown for the current administration, even though the next round of general election is billed to take place over a year from today. On social media, some caricatures are rampant where people had wished 2023 were today or that the next national elections were this year.\n\n\u201cSuch wishes could only have been a product of frustration, which also indicates how desperately Nigerians are looking forward to a fresh breath of air.\u201d\n\nNow, for President Buhari to suggest that he has a successor seems a \u201cno, no\u201d for many Nigerians who spoke with BusinessDay.\n\nReacting to the President\u2019s claim of having a successor, a politician, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the Nigerian citizens would like to have a taste of sweetness after a long period of bitter pill.\n\n\u201cIt is only those who want to play politics that will tell you that Buhari\u2019s years in office since 2015 have been a blessing to the country and its people. I know many of them who speak well of this government in the open for the sake of their stomach, but in secret, they lament and wish for a change of government,\u201d the politician said.\n\nThe Kwara State-born politician further said: \u201cConcerning Buhari\u2019s claim of having a successor, one wonders what manner of a successor that person would be, to continue from where he would leave off in 2023. That, to me, amounts to wishing Nigeria bad luck.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have this tree in my place that produces fruit we call \u2018agbalumo\u2019 (people say it is called- \u2018rubber vine\u2019). Sometimes, if you are lucky to get some species of that fruit, you can eat both the inside and outside- so sweet. But if you get the bad type, you\u2019ll hate the tree and its fruit- because of its bitter taste. What Nigeria has got in the last six-and-half years is the bitter \u2018agbalumo\u2019 and anybody wishing the country an extension of that bitterness and unwholesome experience does not mean well for Nigeria.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Dave Umahi and his politics of pettiness",
          "text": "By Obi Nwa Uballa\n\nHaving eaten too much while the rest of Ebonyi people \u2013 including civil servants who are poorly remunerated \u2013 almost starved, Dave Umahi, governor of the state, will leave office in 2023 with protruding stomach as one of the legacies of his eight-year stewardship in the state. Umahi, today, has a big stomach, and already sees himself as a very big man. Back in the day when we were kids, a big man was a man who had a very big tummy. It was for us, the only clear evidence that a man had arrived. And Umahi who, perhaps, still has such idea that a man\u2019s \u2018bigness\u2018 can be measured by the size of his belly, apparently looks himself, every now and then, in the mirror, and concludes that, \u2018Yes, I have to be the biggest man around now in Igbo land,\u2019 which could be why he has also developed a very fragile ego.\n\nNo doubt, a governor is as big as it gets, and of course, big men often have big ego, especially those who stumbled on wealth. It\u2019s not strange, therefore, that Umahi has become very touchy. In Ebonyi where he reigns much like an emperor, he brooks no opposition, and not even criticisms are allowed. And if anyone is unwise to sing what is not music to his ears, they should be ready to receive the police as guests and made to face some very ridiculous charges in court. A certain Chief Abia Onyike, a former commissioner for information in the state, knows this too well, and so do journalists who have dared to write what he considers unfavorable report.\n\nWhen in late 2020, Umahi decided that in the interest of his presidential ambition, he should defect to the ruling APC, having perhaps realised that with people like his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, he may not have his way in the PDP, he expected every Ebonyi stakeholder to scurry up to him in his new party and quickly pledge allegiance. So, when this did not happen, Umahi declared war on everyone, including former senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim. Talk about nza, the tiny bird who forgot himself after a heavy meal and challenged his chi to a fight.\n\nUmahi imagines that he must have everything his way, and that everyone must queue behind him and defer to him or he raises hell. He must dictate to everyone, even to Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and if the apex Igbo sociocultural group is rash enough to suspend his man for gross indiscretion, Umahi will throw tantrums, for how can Ohanaeze not bow at the feet of a man who is now so big that there cannot be any doubt about his position as the supreme leader of Ndigbo?\n\nBut it\u2019s obvious that Umahi is deluded. No doubt, he has built infrastructure in Ebonyi \u2013 even if there are controversies about whether he uses his companies or whether he is claiming ownership of structures built with state resources \u2013 but building infrastructure in Ebonyi cannot automatically make one a presidential material. One has to have pedigree, and that cannot be gotten by developing a fragile ego and turning oneself into an emperor in the little space one governs. Unfortunately, Umahi has a very exaggerated idea about his self worth and this is becoming a big problem, not just to him, but to Ndigbo and their quest to produce the country\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nHistorically, the greatest challenge Ndigbo have faced in their quest for relevance in national politics, is that everyone wants to be number one, even when they have no chance of getting anywhere. And if they cannot be, then nobody else should. We\u2019ve seen the \u2018pull him down syndrome\u2019 play out time and time again, and clearly that\u2019s what Umahi has resorted as it\u2019s becoming clear that Pius Anyim will be the candidate to beat in 2023.\n\nThe Ebonyi governor, having seen the amount of support the former senate president is getting among the Igbo in his quest to be president, has gone extreme with his childish tantrums. It\u2019s amazing how an individual will grow into an adult, but his brain still functions like that of an infant. After Igbo PDP stakeholders met in Enugu on Thursday and endorsed Anyim\u2019s presidential bid, Umahi\u2019s hireling who run a Facebook page, Ebonyi Online, through which they pour invective on Anyim, posted a press release issued by one faceless group probably working at his behest asking that the likes Adolphus Wabara, former senate president and Enyinnaya Abaribe, senate minority leader, who had at different fora endorsed him, withdraw such endorsement.\n\nThe group which identified itself as South East Democratic Civil Society Coalition (SEDSOC), in the press statement signed by a certain Chief Willy Ezugwu \u2013 apparently the new chief of fifth columnist in the Southeast \u2013 had argued rather unintelligently, that Anyim\u2019s endorsement is \u201chasty and self serving,\u201d as according to them, \u201cThe South East has eminently qualified persons capable of transforming Nigeria if given the chance by the electorate to serve as President in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe eminently qualified persons spoken about by the group of jobbers must, of course, include the likes of Umahi. Such a laughable display of lunacy. But they would soon take the insanity notches higher. Late last week, hired thugs went to destroy a statue of Anyim in his hometown, an insane action gleefully shared by handlers of the same pro Umahi facebook page, Ebonyi Online, as evidence that the former SGF has been rejected in his own homeland. Ebonyi, by the way, has become a volatile state, with armed thugs unleashing mayhem on both perceived and real opponents of the powers that be. Indeed, the whole show would have been hilarious, if not that it has continued to manifest, sometimes, in very brutal attacks on such opponents, even as it has the potential to constitute a serious dent on the quest for Igbo president in 2023.\n\nSadly, it\u2019s been the case in the past and Umahi is not attempting anything new. Time and time again, when there is need for the Igbo to rally and demand for power, little minds will emerge from everywhere to throw spanner in the works. In 2003, when the quest for Igbo president of Nigeria was crystallising, many wanted to contest, even when it was obvious that the late former vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, was clearly the best candidate and the only person with enough political clout to win. It didn\u2019t matter, they simply wanted to run against him, spurred on by their ego and pettiness, and some perhaps to injure his chances for a mess of pottage. Of course, a combination factors ultimately ensured that Ekwueme lost out, once again, to Olusegun Obasanjo, the then president who had emerged PDP candidate and eventually president after Ekwueme was outmanoeuvred at the Jos convention in 1998. 2003, the last time Ekwueme contested, would be the last the Igbo credibly challenged for power at the centre. Subsequently, others, mostly flyweights, contested as \u2018also runs.\u2019\n\nAgain, ahead of 2023, easily the most critical year in the modern political history of Ndigbo, when their quest for power will be both a quest for equity and justice, as well as a moral responsibility on Nigeria, the trait is emerging even before the real battle starts. While it is clear to everyone that Senator Anyim, and perhaps, former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, are the two individuals with the necessary reach and political leverage to credibly challenge for power in Abuja, particularly within the PDP, every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to run. But this is not the problem. There is nothing wrong with anyone from anywhere wanting to be president. Indeed, competition for power is the hallmark of democracy, and in every zone of Nigeria, people have competed and continues compete with one another. In the Southwest for instance, the likes of Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo, Kayode Fayemi, among others, are working hard to garner the support of their people and the rest of the country.\n\nHowever, apart from the fact that the Southeast, given its historical disadvantage, can ill-afford this sort of \u2018sibling rivalry,\u2019 what is remarkably different is that as opposed to promoting themselves, the clowns that dot the political landscape of the zone, resort to pulling down those ahead of them, which is what makes the Umahi scenario in Ebonyi particularly painful. Granted that the Ebonyi governor has the right to seek to be president, even if he has no chance of winning, but every sane Igbo person who wants power should focus on promoting himself at this stage, and not dwell on attacking another who is doing so.\n\nIt is particularly surprising that people who are not in the PDP want to poke their noses into the affairs of the party in the Southeast, and dictate to stakeholders who to endorse and who not to endorse. The obsession is simply incomprehensible. Sadly, while the little minds are focused on pulling their own champions down, they are travelling to Abuja with bags of money to feed others hoping that they\u2019d be favoured by those who presumably hold the levers of power in the country. But they have no idea. A man who helps to destroy his own warrior on account of petty envy or just utter myopia, has only made himself weak and vulnerable, and cannot be trusted by his rival. Umahi should be reminded that where he is headed there is no road. At the end day, he would make mockery of himself and destroy his own political career.\n\nObi Nwa Uballa, a concerned South Easterner wrote from Lagos State.

He had just called down fire from heaven.\n\n\u201cHe had prophesied and prayed and there was rain for the first time in three years. He had brought about national revival. He had outrun the chariot of the King.\n\n\u201cHe was happy but then a message came from the First Lady of the land: \u2018I heard what you did on Mount Carmel, I swear to you by my gods by this time tomorrow, you will be like one of the prophets that you killed\u2019. Elijah the great man of God ran, the man who dared four hundred and fifty prophets ran from a woman,\u201d he said.\n\nAdeboye added: \u201cI know a lot of people have said how could that be? Elijah was very wise. I have told you men of God again and again, don\u2019t fight a woman.\n\n\u201cIf a woman says she is going to deal with you, run. If you learn to run today, you will be alive to fight tomorrow. The African elders have a saying \u201cthe one who knows when to fight and when to run is the one they call the champion\u201d. You must know when to fight and when to run.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Jezebel says \u201cI am coming for you\u201d Elijah did the right thing.

          "text": "\u2026says their demands baseless, self-serving, sarcastic\n\n\u2026as Committee meets party stakeholders\n\nThe leadership and members of the All Progressives Congress in Osun on Sunday appealed to the National Reconciliation Committee to disregard whatever was contained in the petitions forwarded to it by the dissenting members of the party called \u201cThe Osun Progressives, TOP\u201d.\n\nThe ruling party, who described TOP\u2019s requests as self-serving, misleading, sarcastic, spurious and baseless, called on the Committee to dismiss it in its entirety as it was meant to clandestinely destroy the corporate image of the party in the State.\n\nThe party\u2019s position was made known when the Committee met with the Stakeholders of the party at Government House, Osogbo.\n\nResponding to some of the issues raised and prayers made by TOP members to the Reconciliation Committee, the Secretary, State Congress Committee, Mr. Sunday Akere, said the allegation of alienation of party leaders was false and way off from the truth, saying the present leadership structure was put in place by Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola and inherited by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola until few additions made just about few months ago.\n\nOn the allegation that the present Governor hinged most of its policies implementation and execution on the platform that ushered his emergence, Ilerioluwa, Akere noted that the emergence of Ilerioluwa was more or less like the emergence of Oranmiyan created by the immediate past Governor Rauf Aregbesola that ushered him to power, adding that since Oyetola was elected Governor, the party has taken the front burner in all decisions making and implementation.\n\nAkere who noted that TOP was formed purposeful by those that believed in an \u201cAudio\u201d promise given them without the knowledge and consent of the Governor to be made one thing or the other in government, saying the allegation of \u2018sit-tight syndrome\u2019 was not correct because the party leadership in adopting consensus as suggested, ensured that those that were not active or doing well in positions they were holding were replaced.\n\nAccording to him, in the preparation for the just- concluded congresses, the Governor and the party leaders carried everybody along and acted in conformity with the party guidelines and resolutions reached at all levels as the elections went smoothly in all the wards, local governments and state levels.\n\nHe called on the Committee to ask the petitioners \u2014 TOP members \u2014 to produce those that screened their purported aspirants, those that conducted their purported congresses, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission that supervised their congresses, the security agencies present at the venue they claimed they used among others, as demanded by electoral guidelines.\n\nAkere noted that the Governor has no hands in the decision of the Appeal Committee contrary to TOP speculations, saying their decisions were based on facts presented before them.\n\n\u201cFor TOP members to say they participated in the Ward, Local and State Congresses is laughable and it amounts to building something on nothing because they know there was no basis for such; and the allegation of nepotism leveled against the Governor is not only baseless but spurious. He who alleges must prove. All they wanted is juicy appointments.\n\n\u201cTheir prayer asking the Reconciliation Committee to recognise their Congresses is misplaced and distractive because the Committee is to appeal to frayed nerves to give peace a chance and not deciding on the long-concluded Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Committee should take note that, this so- called TOP members have constituted themselves into a team more vicious than the opposition. They don\u2019t have respect for the Governor or the leadership of the party headed by Prince Gboyega Famodun. The manner in which they deride the programmes and achievements of the Governor shows clearly that some of them have made up their minds on leaving the party if they cannot get what they want.\n\n\u201cThey are already holding meetings with the opposition and a faction of the said opposition in the State now takes the responsibility of protecting and defending them as a matter of life and death.\n\n\u201cThe TOP members have no right whatsoever to dwell on issues that do not concern them as their demand for resignation of Mr. Governor from the APC National Caretaker Committee connotes.\n\n\u201cThe Governor as the leader and father to all is always ready to embrace and welcome back those willing to retrace their steps. This Committee in the spirit of the minority having their say while majority have their way should appeal to TOP members to join hands with Mr. Governor in sustaining the progressive legacy in Osun State.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, this Committee should implore the immediate past Governor and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, to rein in TOP members because he publicly declared that he is their patron and and that he supports whatever they do\u201d, Akere submitted.\n\nSpeaking in turns, the Chairman, Osun APC Elders\u2019 Caucus, called \u201cIgbimo Agba\u201d Engr. Sola Akinwumi; Senate Spokesman and Senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Bashiru Ajibola; Former Osun Deputies Governor, Senator Christopher Iyiola Omisore; Mrs Titilayo Ponle; Prince Adeleke Adewoyin; Deputy Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Simeon Popoola; the Party Chairman-elect, Prince Gboyega Famodun; reaffirmed the commitment of the party\u2019s leadership to ensure unity and oneness.\n\nThey passed vote of confidence in the Governor and the leadership and members of the party just as they described the congresses held in the state as most credible and acceptable by all, noting that the leadership of the party would not be distracted by any form of internal or external force.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, noted that their presence at the Government House was part of efforts to ensure fair hearing, equity and justice as it would serve as a forum for the party leadership to respond to and defend some of the allegations raised and petitions filed before it.\n\n\u201cYou are aware that APC like any human endeavours has issues that are affecting the free flow of the affairs of the party, hence the inauguration of the Committee to restore peace. It is natural for human beings to have conflicts, but what is important is to resolve it.\n\n\u201cWe are here to work for the unity, harmony and love within and among the party loyalists.\n\n\u201cWhen we came yesterday, our port of call was to visit Mr Governor to declare that we are at his domain. We have started to take requests, and we felt it was necessary to hear from you too. That is why we are here. We have served the copies of the petitions to the Governor. We expect to have some responses. Nothing is expected to be covered,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Governor of Osun, Adegboyega Oyetola, commended the Committee for taking the bull by the horns, just as he expressed confidence in its ability to carry out the task with fairness and equity.\n\nHe expressed delight at the presence of who-is-who in the party, saying the large turn out of the party leaders was an indication that his Administration was open to all and that power resides in the party.",

          "text": "An infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in Kabul on Saturday. The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on Aug. 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban. Following an exclusive Reuters story published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own. read more After more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul.\n\nDuring the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi \u2013 the boy\u2019s father who had worked as a security guard at the U.S. embassy \u2013 and his wife Suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States. Ahmadi told Reuters in early November in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining 5 meters (15 feet) to the entrance to reclaim him. They said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the United States. Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside.\n\nBut by then the baby was nowhere to be found. Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later. The rest of the family was evacuated \u2013 eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was. The case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country after a 20-year war.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. ALONE AT THE AIRPORT With no U.S. embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one. On the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother\u2019s family who were also set to evacuate.\n\nIn that moment he decided: \u201cI am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview in late November. Safi told Reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook page. Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground. After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby\u2019s parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother\u2019s greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son. After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safi\u2019s neighbors \u2013 who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby \u2013 recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article.\n\nRazawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts \u2013 including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing \u2013 for Safi and his family. But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safi\u2019s brother, who was evacuated to California, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for U.S. entry. Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, 67, who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him to return Sohail to the family. The baby\u2019s family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on individual cases.\n\nThe complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told Reuters he helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the baby\u2019s family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around 100,000 Afghani ($950) for expenses incurred looking after him for five months. \u201cThe grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby,\u201d said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. \u201cWith both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather,\u201d he said on Saturday. Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi told Reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him. In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally returned to his relatives.\n\nThe baby\u2019s parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat. \u201cThere are celebrations, dance, singing,\u201d said Razawi. \u201cIt is just like a wedding indeed.\u201d Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. \u201cHamid and his wife were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport,\u201d Razawi said. Now Ahmadi and his wife and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan, hope Sohail will soon be brought to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility,\u201d his grandfather said. \u201cMy wish is that he should return to them.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) generated approximately N938.5 million from fees collected from importers of generators and other internal revenue sources from June 2020 to June 2021, an analysis of the data for the four quarters provided by the industry regulator, has shown.\n\nNERC had in 2013 introduced a N25,000 charge per unit of 100KVA generator imported into the country in its guidelines for obtaining clearance certificate for the importation of generating sets and related matters.\n\nIt also fixed a charge of N3,500 per unit of between 25kva and 100kva generators imported into the country, while generators between 5kva and 25kva attract a charge of N1,000 per unit.\n\nFurthermore, it resolved to begin the collection of N250 per unit of between 2.5kva and 5kva, while between 0.45 Kva and 2.5 Kva generators attract a charge of N150 per unit.\n\nThe amount collected by NERC is exclusive of duties and other taxes paid by the importers in the country.\n\nNigeria still relies largely on generating sets to power its over $400 billion economy.\n\nThe Lagos State government had in October 2021 revealed that as a result of the country\u2019s inefficient and over-centralised electricity supply system, residents of the state alone, generated over 4,500MW daily through the use of generators.\n\nDetails of the financial position of the NERC showed that in the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, the IGR from fees arising from the importation of generator sets , licence processing and licencing fee was N431 million.\n\nA breakdown of the amount showed that N20.23 million was generated in April, N160.79 million in May and N250.25 million in June of that year.\n\nFurthermore, in the first quarter of 2021, NERC raked in N126.53 million, broken down into N50.80 million, N28.13 million and N47.60 million in January, February and March, respectively.\n\nAn analysis of the last six months of 2020 showed that in the third quarter of 2020, covering July, August and September, the industry regulator made N276.31 million from the same sources, segmented into\n\nN71.10 million, N111.11 million and N94.10 million, in the three months.\n\nSimilarly, in the last three months of 2020, NERC raked in N104.88 million from import fee imposed on the sale of generating sets, among others.\n\nHowever, the total operating levy received from market charges were N4.868 billion for Q2,2021 and N5.061 billion for Q1,2021. Total revenue for the period was N5.299 billion and N5.18 billion respectively, with personnel cost gulping N1 billion and N1.88 billion respectively.\n\nBefore then, in the last six months of 2020, operating levy was N2.64 billion for Q3 and N2.19 billion for Q2, with personnel cost standing at N843 million and N1.17 billion for the two quarters.\n\nBut the commission\u2019s total expenditure profile for the period was N6.1 billion shared into N1.6, N1.0 billion, N2.0 billion and N1.44 billion for the period spanning June 2020 to June 2021.\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter under review (Q2,2021), the total revenue realized by the commission was N5.30 billion, about 2.12 per cent higher than the N5.19 billion revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\n\u201cThere was a 230 per cent rise in other internally generated revenue while the operating levy (i.e., market charges) recorded a decline of 3.75 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe higher revenue recorded in 2021/Q2 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\n\u201cDuring the same period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the commission stood at N1.44 billion which is lower than the N2.01 billion incurred during the first quarter of 2021,\u201d NERC stated.\n\nFor Q3, 2020, it pointed out that the total revenue that accrued to the commission was N2.93 billion, representing an increase of 31 per cent from the revenue recorded in the second quarter and a decrease of\n\n10 per cent from the revenues recorded in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the improvement in revenues, the commission\u2019s expenditure declined to N1.05 billion in the quarter from N1.36 billion in the second quarter and N1.94billion in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, liabilities also declined to N123 million from N218 million in the preceding quarter. The observed decline in expenditure was due largely to the reduction in operating activities of the\n\ncommission as a result of the Covid-19 movement restriction imposed by the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nAs for the summary of the commission\u2019s revenue and expenditure during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, it stated that the total revenue realised by the commission N1 .95 billion, about 33.35 per\n\ncent lower than the revenue realised in the preceding quarter.\n\nNERC noted that the higher revenue recorded in 2020/Q3 was partly due to the recovery of outstanding licencing fees, the grant received from Mac-Arthur foundation and the fund released from the statutory budget for capital project.\n\nNonetheless, it stressed that both the operating levy (i.e., market charges) and other IGR such as licencing fee charged by the commission declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe operating levy and IGR respectively declined by 30.36 per cent and 62.04 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2020. During the some period, the total (capital and recurrent) expenditure of the\n\ncommission stood at N1.60 billion which is higher than the N1.05 billion incurred during the third quarter of 2020.\n\nA comparison of the revenue and expenditure of the commission within the fourth quarter of 2020, it stated, indicated lesser expenditure incurred when compared to actual cash receipts.\n\nNERC explained however that there was a positive net cash flow of N347.47 million during the period. \u201cHowever, the total liabilities as at the end of the quarter stood at N419.68million,\u201d it added.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "To end the environmental menace occasioned by black soot in Rivers State, Governor Nyesom Wike, has tasked the state police command to collaborate with other security agencies, council chairmen and traditional rulers to arrest those involved in crude oil theft for prosecution.\n\nThe governor said the illegal bunkering and artisanal refining leading to black soot in the environment was endangering the health of residents of the state.\n\nWike gave the charge at a dinner and award night for officers of the Rivers State Police Command, held at the Police Officers Mess, Port Harcourt.\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, Emeka Woke, the governor declared that the state government had resolved to tackle those involved in crude oil theft and refining.\n\nWike stated that the state government was willing to provide the police and other security agencies all that would be required to dislodge and end the activities of artisanal refiners in the state.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cthe state is prepared to fight them more than ever before.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that since the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Friday Eboka assumed duties last year, Rivers State has witnessed peace and improved policing.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder the crime index in the state has reduced drastically. We thought we are the only people witnessing it, but with the award you got from the wife of the Inspector General of Police, it is an eloquent testimony that what we are seeing as a state, is also being observed from all the nation.\u201d\n\nThe governor said policing in Rivers State has improved remarkably because the management of the Nigeria Police Force at the Force Headquarters and the State Command, respectively distanced themselves from politics.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we will continue to support the security agencies in the state. Our support for security agencies is not only centered on Police Force. We are also extending similar gesture to the Navy, Air force and others.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe the primary function of any responsible government is to protect life and property. So, we have no option than to continue to support in providing logistics and everything that can make the security agencies in the State to function very well.\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that if our people are safe and the life here is peaceful, there will be increase in economics activities and the Internally Generated Revenue will also go up.\u201d\n\nWike commended the CP for discharging his duties professionally.\n\nHe, however, announced N1million reward for each of the recipients of the Rivers State Police Command award and N10 million to the command for organising the event.\n\nSpeaking, Commissioner of Police, Eboka explained that 2021 was a remarkable year for the command because Rivers State emerged as one of the most peaceful state in Nigeria.\n\nHe thanked Almighty God for his grace and Inspector General of Police for choosing Rivers State as the venue for the launching of South-South Operation Restore Peace.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis came with the deployment of special forces with sophisticated equipment as well as combat helicopter to the state\u201d.\n\nHe commended Governor Wike for being very phenomenal in the attainment of peace and security in the state.\n\n\u201cSince my assumption of office, the command has received more than 50 patrol vehicles fitted with modern gadgets from the State government. This gesture alone enhanced visibility policing in the state.\n\n\u201cRecall too, when we lost men to miscreants in sometimes April 2021, the governor did not allow us to suffer alone. He wiped the tears of the deceased families with a total sum N220 million, which means each family received the sum of N20 million.\n\n\u201cRecall the #ENDSARS saga. At the end of that saga, which led to the burning down of police stations and vehicles across the nation, the state governor did not abandon us to work under the trees. Rather, the governor constructed a storey building each for the Area Command, Oyigbo and the Divisional Police in Oyigbo.\u201d\n\nThe recipients of the Rivers State Police Command 2021 awards are: G.I.A Godstime Nwuju, best traffic officer; Inspector Winfrey Ini Akpan, best controller; CSP Bako Aghashim, best DPO; CSP Grace Wonwu, best female DPO; and the best visiting tactical team leader went to CSP Adamu.",

Debo Ologunagba, in a statement issued yesterday, completely debunked the claims.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u20182023: We Have Not Zoned Our Presidential Ticket \u2013PDP,\u2019 the party said: \u201cIts attention has been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that our party has zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is completely misleading as it does not in any way represent the position of our party.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is a political party founded on democratic principles and every action of the party, including zoning, is based on extensive consultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues as well as the various tendencies and interests across the nation, with the main objective of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-existence and development of our nation are reinforced and promoted.\n\n\u201cThe PDP, therefore, urges Nigerians, our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. Our party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thanks Nigerians across the board for the overwhelming interest they have in our party as their sure platform to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule and urges them to remain united and focused as we join forces for the task ahead,\u201d the statement by Olugunagba explained.\n\nMany northern governors and the 17 southern governors had thrown their weight behind the clamour for power shift to the southern part of the country in 2023 to ensure justice and fair play.\n\nSome of the northern governors include Professor Babagana Zulum (Borno); Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina); Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna); Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano); Samuel Ortom (Benu) and Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), among others.\n\nThe southern governors under the leadership of the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had also, irrespective of political affiliation, given a strong position that power \u201cmust move to the South in 2023.\u201d\n\nSince 1999 when democracy returned under this dispensation, former President Olusegun Obasanjo governed from (1999-2007); the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (2007 \u2013 2010); former President Goodluck Jonathan (2010-2015); and President Muhammadu Buhari (2015-2023).\n\nWith the north completing eight years in 2023, it is expected that power will shift to the south.\n\nHowever, some politicians from the north are working hard to retain power beyond 2023.",
