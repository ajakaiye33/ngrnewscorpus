          "text": "Human rights activist, Femi Falana, SAN, has said that the strike declared by the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, in solidarity with the ASUU is not illegal as claimed by the Federal Government.\n\nRecall that ASUU had been on strike for over five months to press down its demands before the federal government, which include implementation of the agreement reached between both parties in 2009 and and non-implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, IPPIS, as it applies to lecturers, among others.\n\nIn a statement, Falana, who is also the Interim Chairman, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond, ASCAB, said: \u201cAs a sequel to the failure of the Federal Government to resolve the industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) over five months ago, the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has announced plans to embark on nationwide protest marches and rallies in support of ASUU on July 26 and 27, 2022.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the Federal Government has declared the proposed protest illegal. The Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, stated this while briefing journalists on the decisions of the Federal Executive Council, FEC, at its meeting in Abuja last Wednesday.\n\n\u2018\u2019With respect, the proposed protest cannot be said to be illegal since it is an expression of the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly of Nigerian workers guaranteed by Sections 39 and 40 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 and Articles 39 and 40 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights Ratification and Enforcement Act Cap A9, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the fundamental right of the people of Nigeria to protest for and against the government was upheld by the Court of Appeal in the celebrated case of the Inspector-General of Police v All Nigeria Peoples Party (2008) 12 WRN 65,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further said, \u201cIn the leading judgment of the Court of Appeal, Adekeye JCA (as then was) held that \u2018Public Order Act should be promulgated to complement Sections 39 and 40 of the Constitution in context and not to stifle or cripple it. A rally or placard-carrying demonstration has become a form of expression of views on current issues affecting government and the governed in a sovereign state.\n\n\u201cIt is a trend recognised and deeply entrenched in the system of governance in civilised countries. It will not only be primitive but also retrogressive if Nigeria continues to require a pass to hold a rally. We must borrow a leaf from those who have trekked the rugged path of democracy and are now reaping the dividend of their experience.\n\n\u201cIn line with the injunction of the Court of Appeal, the National Assembly ensured that the right of Nigerian citizens to assemble and express themselves freely and peacefully has been complimented by the Police Establishment Act 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Act has imposed a duty on the Nigeria Police Force to provide adequate security during meetings, rallies and processions convened by Nigerian citizens. Specifically, section 83(4) of the Act stipulates as follows:\n\n\u201cWhere a person or organisation notifies the police of his or its intention to hold a public meeting, rally or procession on a public highway or such meetings in a place where the public has access to, the police officer responsible for the area where the meeting rally or procession will take place shall mobilize personnel to provide security cover for the meeting, rally or the procession.\n\n\u201cHaving confirmed that the Nigeria Labour Congress has notified the authorities of the Nigeria Police Force of the planned protest marches and rallies in strict compliance with the aforementioned provision of the Police Establishment Act, 2020, we call on the Federal Government to respect the democratic wishes of Nigerian workers to identify with the striking university lecturers.\n\n\u201cSince the protest by the NLC is just and legitimate, ASCAB has mobilised lawyers in the Federal Capital Territory and the 36 states of the federation to provide legal services for the protesters,\u201d he said.",

The next government in Nigeria, whoever leads it, will have to pull a rabbit out a hat to keep our fiscal boat afloat. Asset sales and debt restructuring will likely be inevitable.\n\n\u201cUnlike in the OBJ era, no one will give us debt relief. Our case is weak because we have been irresponsible. Simple.

          "text": "Call for more media engagement\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nFollowing frustration voiced out by the Buhari-led administration over poor participation of Nigerians in the Whistleblower Policy after six years it was introduced to upscale fight against corruption, Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, weekend, told the Federal Government to make policy attractive and transparent.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard on the failure, collapse and way forward about the Whistleblower policy, the CSOs including Africa Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, ANEEJ, Concerned Nigerians, and others said the fight against corruption in Nigeria is just a lip-service as more looting is ongoing at various levels and scale.\n\nLack of political will killed interest of Nigerians in Whistleblower policy -ANEEJ\n\nRead Also:\n\nNYSC trust fund will end up in private pockets \u2013 CSO\n\nNGO wants Whistle Blowers Protection Bill passed\n\nECOWAS Commission calls for whistle blower protection laws\n\nThe Executive Director, Africa Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, ANEEJ, Reverend David Ugolor, said lack of political will killed interest of Nigerians in Whistleblower policy.\n\nUgolor said: \u201cThe citizens welcome the whistle blowing policy but the government was unable to implement it because of conflict of interest and lack of political will at the leadership level.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this the citizens could not trust government and decided to ignore the policy.\n\n\u201cThose who made efforts to blow the whistle could not share good experience which could have encouraged others to participate in the policy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the ANEEJ boss in his view and solution said, \u201cFor whistleblowing policy to work you have to establish a trust environment but our government people could not deliver on the issues of trust.\n\n\u201cIf the government is serious then I will suggest they provide the enabling environment for the people to participate.\n\n\u201cThe key is building trust culture and providing support for law enforcement officials to work with the public to unpack serious crimes.\u201d\n\nEFCC failed to involve influential voices, faces in fight- CN\n\nAccording to the Convener, Concerned Nigerians, CN, Deji Adeyanju, the Federal Government and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, failed to involve influential voices and faces in Whistleblower policy, hence its less attraction and collapse.\n\nAdeyanju said: \u201cThe federal government, has refused to make the policy attractive.\n\n\u201cNigerians and citizens world over, we always forget policies or active policies once it is not not spoken about all the time.\n\n\u201cSo what the federal government failed to do about the policies that they refuse to apply the public principle of reputation, both in the media space, social media, and keep the policy ever afresh in the minds of people.\n\n\u201cThey also failed to get influential voices and faces involved in the policy because Nigerians were not able to see how successful the\n\npolicies were. So that is one of the reasons why Nigerians have jettisoned interests in the policy.\n\n\u201cIf there is a way the government had planned, constant reminder for the policy, highlighting the success of the policy, and citizens who have benefited from whistleblowing, civil servants who have benefited from whistleblowing.\n\n\u201cGovernment don\u2019t have to hide or reveal full identity or full disclosure, but to say, we paid this particular citizen, N1 billion because since we did the policy we paid N100 million or N200 million that would make people know that there is incentive for reporting or whistleblowing.\n\nSo the policy will we be a front burner issue in the country.\n\nHowever, there were so many people that complained that they reported, EFCC was owing them, EFCC has not paid them, and all that.\n\n\u201cThose are some of the reasons why the policy has completely failed.\u201d\n\nHowever he said, \u201cAll hope is not lost, Federal Government can reintroduce the policy and back it up with aggressive media campaigns, social media campaigns, get so many famous people involved in the policy, marketing, and advertising the policy and all that.\n\n\u201cThat is one way that the federal government can rejig and encourage Nigerians to actively participate in the whistleblowing policy.\n\n\u201cOn the way to go about citizens\u2019 participation, more incentives should be should be put in place for people to actively participate in the policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Legal Practitioner and Public Affairs Analyst, Atambi Ade, said, \u201cThe government should guarantee people their security when they blow the whistle.\n\n\u201cSecondly, it boils down to the sincerity of the people pursuing this fight against corruption, and if that is properly established then other strategies would follow including the whistleblower policy.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is also key on the policy because those involved need to show that and with that we all being citizens of this country will join the fight because we are partners in the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cAnother issue is people who were arrested, Government treated them with kid-gloves and this discouraged the people to get involved.\n\n\u201cFor instance, look at the case of the money discovered in a flat in Ikoyi, Lagos; at the airport in Kaduna, the issue involving an NNPC personnel, and others.\n\n\u201cAnother thing about all these cases is our friends in the media don\u2019t follow up these cases for Nigerians to know the development. The media need to follow up to the end.\n\n\u201cRight now we don\u2019t know what has happened to those blowing whistle; how many of them were actually rewarded, some have cried out that their lives have been threatened and all that. When people hear such stories they lose interest instantly.\n\n\u201cThe process of reward for whistleblowers is too cumbersome for people to get their money promised by the government.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC failed to brief Nigerians on the fight against corruption band the status of the whistleblower policy and its impacts, results, how much recovered, how many whistleblowers rewarded and also their challenges and assure Nigerians of their safety if they report corruption cases, but failed to do that.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying EFCC should give us details but just basic information about the fight against corruption.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Amalgamated Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners, Repairs and Riders Association of Nigeria (ACOMORAN) has advised the Federal Government to jettison the idea of banning the use of motorcycles nationwide as it would be counter-productive.\n\nThe Association said the outright ban may throw over 40 million Nigerians, who make a living through motorcycles, into the saturated labour market.\n\nIt equally warned of the economic and security implications, saying besides impoverishing millions of Nigerians, it would further compound the anti-social vices the government was trying to contain.\n\nNational President of ACOMORAN, Alhaji Samsudeen Adebayo Apelogun, gave the warning on Monday, at a press briefing in Abuja, where he noted that their membership base stands at 12 million nationwide, with 6000 adequately registered.\n\nRecall that the Federal Government, after its security council meeting on July 21st, 2022, gave an indication that it might be compelled to ban the use of motorcycles and mining activities as it had been discovered to be major means of movement by bandits and source of amassing ransom from kidnap victims.\n\nBut opposing the move, the leadership of ACOMORAN said the government lacked effective security architecture, hence should overhaul their intelligence gathering mechanism, rather than creating another monster that will ultimately add salt to the injury.\n\nApelogun said, \u201cCommuters see motorcycles as a relief to their transportation problems, while motorcycle riders see their adventure as a source of livelihood. Without a doubt, the use of motorcycles has enhanced mobility for the middle income earners, which by extension has contributed to an increase in production through an increase in man hours.\n\n\u201cLet me put it on record that from experience, 95 percent of those you see riding motorcycles are doing it because they don\u2019t have better options and they don\u2019t want to take to crime.\n\n\u201cIf ten million of these 40million people they plan to render jobless take to crime, can the government contain them? If you attribute the movement of terrorists to motorcycles, don\u2019t criminals operate with vehicles? When terrorists regrettably attacked Kuje prison, was it the motorcycle riders that caused the failure of intelligence gathering?\u201d",

Ezeh Tochukwu Vincent, who spoke with newsmen after the group\u2019s meeting in Enugu, said that the move will ensure the emergence of Senator Bola Tinubu as president with victory for all APC candidates in the elections.\n\nEzeh urged the electorate to de- emphasise issues of ethnicity and religion and embrace the APC presidential candidate, Senator Tinubu, saying he has the capacity to change the nation\u2019s narrative for good.\n\nThe group, which has been formally coopted as one of APC\u2019s support groups is a registered body with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), with Headquarters in the nation\u2019s capital, Abuja, and State Chapters across the country.\n\nEzeh said LMI remains a firm believer in good governance, and would continue to promote same in the country.\n\nAccording to him, LMI, is also committee in promoting the societal change through attitudinal reorientation at all levels, adding that the group equally advocates and participate in the promotion of credible elections in Nigeria.\n\nHe explained the resolve by the group to support Tinubu\u2019s candidacy and APC\u2019s governorship candidate in Enugu State, Chief Uche Nnaji, is borne out of the fact that the duo have the capacity to deliver the goods if given the mandate.\n\nHe noted: \u201cIt is on record that the 2023 APC presidential flag bearer, Ahmed Bola Tinubu proved him self worthy when he was the Lagos State governor. He transformed the the entire state, uplifted it\u2019s economy, to the effect that it became almost the largest in West African sub region.\n\n\u201cWe are talking of a man who governed Lagos State for some years without the monthly statutory federal allocation, yet, he delivered real democracy dividends to the good people of Lagos state.\n\n\u201cNigerian electorate can still recall vividly how the then PDP led federal government under Ex-president Olusengun Obasanjo\u2019s watch bluntly refused releasing the Lagos state federal monthly allocation yet, the then sitting Governor, Ahmed Tinubu through the internally Generated Revenue (IGR) was able to provide adequate infrastructural amenities to the people.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding sentimental, Tinubu, is a tested and trusted political leader, who has the capacity to transform the entire Nigeria, take the economy to the next level, and above all, he is a detrabilised Nigeria, with all the needed leadership experience.\n\nEzeh, a former APC Youth leader in Nkanu East Council area and Chieftain of the defunct All Nigeria\u2019s people\u2019s party (ANPP), said: \u201cOur focus as a group is to support the APC presidential Candidate, the Enugu State Governorship flag bearer, Chief Nnaji, and every other standard bearers of the party at the national and state, levels. And so far, we are deepening the messages in rural communities in Enugu State.\n\nHe added: \u201cin Enugu state, we are supporting the APC gubernatorial candidate, Chief Nnaji, a renowned industrialist, who has really impacted on the lives of our people, and has all it takes to wipe away their sufferings occasioned by the PDP bad leadership in the state.\n\nEzeh, who is also the South East Zonal Coordinator of LMI, said \u201cGod\u2019s willing, and with the support of the Electorate, if voted into office, Chief Nnaji will change the leadership narrative in Enugu state, by showing PDP what good governance is all about.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Almalgamated Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners, Repairs and Riders Association of Nigeria (ACOMORAN), has warned that the proposed ban of commercial motorcycles throughout the country as part of measures to tackle security challenges, will not only throw 40 million Nigerians into the job market, it will create a worst monster behind terrorism.\n\nRecall that the minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami, had announced that the National Security Council, chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari, had explained that government might be compelled to ban the use of motorcycles and mining activities as it has been discovered to be a major means of movement by bandits and source of amassing ransom from kidnap victims.\n\nMalami had added that those using motorcycles as means of transport were not up to 20 percent of the country\u2019s population, adding that if that percentage is made to sacrifice \u201cI think that sacrifice is not too much and is worthy of being considered\u201d.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Monday, the National President of ACOMORAN, Samsudeen Apelogun, noted that their membership base stands at 12 million nationwide, with 6 million adequately registered.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to jettison the idea of banning the use of motorcycles nationwide, as it would be counter productive on the long run.\n\nApelogun equally warned of the economic and security implications, saying besides impoverishing millions of Nigerians, it would further compound the anti-social vices government is trying to contain.\n\nThe leadership of ACOMORAN said the government lacks effective security architecture, hence should overhaul their intelligence gathering mechanism, rather than creating another monster that will ultimately add salt to the injury.\n\nApelogun said, \u201cCommuters see motorcycles as a relief to their transportation problems while motorcycle riders see their adventure as a source of livelihood. Without a doubt, the use of motorcycles has enhanced mobility for the middle and income earners which by extension has contributed to an increase in production through an increase in man hours.\n\n\u201cLet me put it on record that from experience, 95 percent of those you see riding motorcycles are doing it because they don\u2019t have better options but they don\u2019t want to take to crime.\n\n\u201cIf 10 million of these 40 million people they plan to render jobless take to crime, can the government contain them? If you attribute the movement of terrorists to motorcycles, don\u2019t criminals operate with vehicles? When terrorists regrettably attacked Kuje prison, was it the motorcycle riders that caused the failure of intelligence gathering?\n\n\u201cIf they rode motorcycles there, how were they able to beat all the security checkpoints to get to such a fortified facility? Was it motorcycles that made it possible for them to overpower the security agents attached to the facility? Are motorcycles also responsible for the late re-enforcement?\u201d\n\nApelogun, advised the government which he noted is at its twilight, \u201cto concentrate on how to alleviate the agonies of the citizenry against this move that will further compound their pains.\u201d\n\nThe ACOMORAN president, provided some practical ideas on how to fight criminality.\n\n\u201cFirst, the government should revive the economy for businesses to thrive. Today, the naira exchanges at N630 to a US Dollar, and this deal a terrible blow to businesses. The epileptic natures of our power supply have grounded many small-scale industries thereby making it difficult for artisans to operate. If a solution is found to power supply today, I am very confident that many of the youths who are involved in criminality will be gain-fully emplpyed or engaged.\n\n\u201cIn summary, if the government can provide a stable power supply, organize the Bank of Transportation to cater to the transportation sector, revive our economy, make naira exchange at a reasonable rate against the dollar and other foreign currencies, provide infrastructure and an enabling environment for businesses and investors to drive or ply their trades as well as provide security agencies, especially the police that is in change of the enforcement of law and order with the need d tools and motivation. To work, the rate of criminality will drastically drop to a minimal level.\u201d",

          "text": "Ijeoma Okonji\n\nAfter 19 days of protesting against the gross neglect by Nigeria Agip Oil Company Limited (NAOC), the people of Idheze Community in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State, yesterday vowed to continue with the agitation until the company accedes to their demands.\n\nThe community women had started the protest on Wednesday July 6, 2022 by barricading the road leading to the oil wells being operated by NAOC, saying until their demands are met, they would not allow the company to have access.\n\nAlmost three weeks of being in the bush under the rain and without any meaningful response from NAOC, the people have declared that they would sustain the protest and blockage of the company\u2019s access to the oil wells in Idheze Community.\n\nGiving update on the protest, the Public Relation Officer (PRO) of Idheze Community, Mr. Power Okpure, said in a statement that the attitude of NAOC has vindicated the community which has insisted that the Italian firm is only interested in getting oil and gas without thinking about the development and welfare of the community.\n\nOkpure said: \u201cIt is very unfortunate that after 20 days of protest, NAOC has refused to accede to our demands and we are prepared to sustain the agitation which is our right and legal obligation of NAOC. Before we embarked on the protest, we wrote several letters to the company, which they ignored. The Delta State Government invited them twice to discuss our complaints, they failed to honour the invitations. And when we began the protest on July 6, the Delta State Commissioner for Oil and Gas invited us to a meeting with NAOC officials on July 11. At that meeting, the oil company attested to the fact Idheze Community has been a very peaceful host without any history of vandalism or oil theft. But is this how to repay a peaceful community.\u201d.\n\nHe explained that the community sees the action of NAOC as an oppression and injustice, saying that, \u201cfor over 10 years, no infrastructural development in our community, no employment for our people and we have been neglected in the area of local content.\u201d\n\nHe noted that instead of putting pressure on NAOC to do the needful, the government is asking us to lift the blockage.\n\n\u201cWe consider this as abnormal and oppressive. This is a company that has failed to develop our and refused to employ our people for over 10 years. Instead of asking the company to listen to us, we are being asked to suspend our protest. This is unfair and we will not lift the blockage until our demands are met,\u201d Okpure stated.\n\nThe PRO had explained that the operations of NAOC is guided by the provision that every four years, there ought to be a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with their community.\n\n\u201cThe MoU that we signed in 2008 expired in 2011. NAOC refused to sign a new MoU since then. By our calculation, there ought to have been two separate MoUs between when that of 2008 expired and last year when the government introduced the Petroleum Industrial Act(PIA). We have appealed to NAOC through the Delta State Ministry of Oil and Gas and other agencies but the company has refused to listen to us. Hence, we have decided to carry out the protest and we are saying until they compensate us for the years they did not sign MoU, we will not allow them to operate,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "* Say Munguno has run out of ideas\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Arewa Youth Assembly (AYA) has called for the resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Munguno, over the embarrassing activities of terrorists in the country.\n\nThe group also called on the federal government to ensure that those in captivity are freed and people displaced from their communities by terrorists are returned to their homes before the 2023 elections.\n\nIn a statement on Monday in Kaduna, the AYA said the growing audacity of non-state actors, particularly the recent invasion of the Kuje prison in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, which led to the escape of many members of the Boko Haram insurgents, showed that even President Muhammadu Buhari is not safe in the Presidential Villa.\n\nThe statement signed by the spokesman of the group, Mohammed Danlami, said AYA believes that the NSA has run out of ideas on how to tackle the security situation and should resign or be sacked by the president.\n\nThe statement empathised with the abducted passengers of the March 28, Abuja-Kaduna train attack and their families over the unfortunate incident, decrying the humiliating and dehumanising treatment they are subjected to, as was seen in a video released by their captors on Sunday on the social media.\n\nDanlami said: \u201cThe Arewa Youth Assembly shares in the pain and agony of the immediate families and friends of those in captivity and pray God to intervene through His supernatural power and set them free.\n\n\u201cThe AYA notes that the growing audacity of non-state actors which led to the invasion of Kuje Maximum Prison, Abuja which led to the release of numerous arrested Boko Haram commanders shows that even Mr President in the Presidential Villa is not safe. It is just a matter of time, these ragtag elements will draw inspiration from the Afghanistan terrorists and take over leadership of our country.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that this insult to our country\u2019s sovereignty would not have been possible if the National Security Adviser, who is supposed to guide Mr President had not run out of ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to AYA, \u201cSince Munguno\u2019s appointment over seven years ago, we strongly believe that the man has run out of steam and does not have anything new to offer. Hence, the honourable thing for him to do is to pack his luggage and return to his retirement destination. Where he fails to, Mr. President should urgently sack him and get him replaced.\n\n\u201cThe youths will not participate in activities in the build up to 2023 general election and the election proper if our brothers and sisters in captivity are not released.\n\n\u201cAlso, most of our local government areas and communities that are now under the control of either Ansaru terrorists in North-central and North-west or ISWAP in North-east should be recovered.\n\n\u201cIn other words, politicians are only welcome to our region, when we have every reason to believe that our forests are free from bandits and terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe assembly strongly believes that if the amount of monies budgeted for security and defence were deployed for such purposes, the terrorists in our bushes would not have been able to withstand our armed forces for three days.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians believe that the Armed Forces remain the most corrupt institution in our country, that need to be properly checked by various anti-graft agencies.\u201d\n\nThe statement reminded Buhari of a bomb explosion that nearly killed him in Kaduna in 2014, urging him to \u201ccome down hard on the terrorist elements who are sharing legitimacy of government with him\u201d.",

Unfortunately, those predictions are Nigeria\u2019s current realities,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cRecall that BudgIT, in a consultation memo released in February 2022 titled: \u2018Leveraging budget reforms for economic development,\u2019 had articulated several reform issues bordering on Nigeria\u2019s public financial management regime that affect the very core of governance, separation of powers, expenditure efficiency, and the livelihoods of millions of Nigerians; 83 million of whom live in extreme poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour months later, some of those same challenges exist, with additional ones, if not properly managed, may spell fiscal crisis for an already impoverished nation. In particular, the debt service spending is only N93.6 billion less than the combined total personnel and capital expenditure for the period under review. Also alarming are the expenditure targets for the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), which have only been 15 percent (of the total N5.10 billion naira) for the period under review.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying that the fortunes of the most populous black nation on earth, Nigeria, have worsened in the last 8 months after the 2022 budget was passed.\u201d\n\nGabriel Okeowo, BudgIT\u2019s country director, said despite being confronted with a myriad of challenges ranging from the ASUU strike which has crippled tertiary education, Nigerians are waiting with bated breath for the national budget to begin to bring about relief and the positive change it was claimed to have harboured.\n\nThe civic-tech group advised the federal government to discontinue indiscriminate borrowing through ways and means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is in light of the above that we call on all well-meaning Nigerians, CSOs, media, the private sector, the international community, and reformers to join the call for the federal government to do the following: discontinue indiscriminate borrowing through ways and means, which is creating a ballooning set of interest payments, running parallel to the external debt, as well as increasing the money supply and creating more monetary volatility; check the oil theft that is now commonplace in the petroleum industry, and has encumbered the countries ability to meet its production quotas-the latter having fallen to 1.25 million barrels as at May 2022,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cRamp up the remittance of operating surpluses by MDAs and GOEs to boost FG\u2019s independent revenues, which is currently underperforming, and take considered action to reform subsidy, this achieves the twin objectives of having citizen buy-in and revenue savings that are channelled into priority areas.\u201d",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Nigeria to the UK with the Global Talent Visa",
          "text": "Japa (verb, /d\u0292a pa/, Nigeria): to leave one\u2019s home country in search of greener pastures.\n\nWhen writers Ope Adedeji and Chika Jones decided to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa, both thought the process would be like all other visa applications\u2014grueling and 3 months long, filled with insurmountable documentation, and lingering interviews.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In 2020, the UK instituted the Global Talent Visa which allows leaders or potential leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology, to work in the UK for up to 5 years, without a sponsor or a job offer.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Adedeji to TechCabal in an interview. \u201cFrom start to finish, the whole process probably took about 2 months. And from an application perspective, I was most surprised about how effective it was.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 surprise was that a 5-year residence visa existed for writers. \u201cVisas like these are usually reserved for STEM careers or even tech professionals. Writers and poets like me usually focus on fellowships or masters\u2019 degrees,\u201d he commented in a Twitter Space he and Adedeji held earlier this year.\n\nJones\u2019 own application process, from submission to approval, took a total of 2 weeks, but he\u2019d taken 5 months to plan, and the only major delays he experienced were with his medical tests.\n\nOpe Adedeji, managing editor at Paystack\n\nAdedeji and Jones are just 2 out of many Nigerians who have taken advantage of the Global Talent Visa to leave their home countries to work abroad. In fact, Nigeria ranked third for the total number of applications processed for the visa in 2021 while South Africa ranked 10th.\n\nMany more are looking to take advantage of this opportunity, and if you\u2019re one of them, here\u2019s how 2 exceptionally talented individuals japa-ed with the UK Global Talent Visa.\n\nExceptional Talent v Exceptional Promise\n\nThe first stage of applying for the UK Global Talent Visa is getting endorsed by any of 6 relevant endorsing bodies.\n\nUnlike other visa applications where you have to book interviews at consulates, the Global Talent Visa has 6 governing bodies that review applications from applicants who can bid for the visa under 2 circumstances: Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise.\n\nPeople who apply under Exceptional Talent are established leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology. They have won prestigious awards, appeared in notable publications, and have many years of experience under their belt.\n\nApplicants under Exceptional Promise have a record of outstanding work in their field over a 5-year period. They are intentional about developing outstanding international track records.\n\nEach of the 6 endorsing bodies has its own requirements for the Exceptional Talent and Exceptional Promise, and you can check them out here.\n\nAdedeji and Jones, both of whom have glowing track records of excellence in writing, applied for the visa under Exceptional Promise for arts and culture, which is open to creatives with careers in literature, dance, architecture, fashion design, film, and animation. The documents they needed were basic: passports, tuberculosis test results, and more importantly, 3 recommendation letters from organisations and people established in their fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been published in quite a number of notable magazines and publications over the years, and I also had a few literary awards to my name. I\u2019d also been a speaker at some literary festivals, so all I had to do was gather these in a document and submit it to the Arts Council,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nChika Jones, poet and digital marketing manager\n\nWhen she first heard of the visa, Adedeji, who is also managing editor at Paystack, had thought endorsement would be the most difficult part of the application process. \u201cI was sceptical at first because I thought I probably didn\u2019t qualify. After reading a bit more and speaking to people who\u2019d already gotten the visa, I realised I had a chance, and I took it.\u201d\n\nAdedeji mentioned that she collated links to her appearances and awards, her published stories, and news mentions in a Google Doc. \u201cThat\u2019s all it took,\u201d she said.\n\nJones concurred, adding that the process is less stressful than people think it is. \u201cVisas are notoriously difficult to get, and so people don\u2019t even try. But with this, it wasn\u2019t as mind-numbing as I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe UK Global Talent Visa website states that endorsement takes about 4 weeks, but both writers got their arts and culture endorsements within 2 weeks.\n\nFunfere Koroye, a design engineer whom TechCabal interviewed for an earlier episode of Digital Nomads, applied under Exceptional Talent. His route was a bit different from Adedeji\u2019s and Jones\u2019. While the creators had to apply to the Arts Council England, the endorsing body for arts and culture, Koroye had to apply to Tech Nation, the endorsing body for digital technology.\n\nUnder the digital technology option, people with technical and business skills can apply for endorsement.\n\nThe careers eligible for the digital technology Talent Visa\n\nKoroye already had over 8 years of experience building and designing products, and even building a startup, NuPay Technologies. All he had to do was dust up his resume, gather the links to sites like Figma and GitHub which highlighted his projects, and submit them to Tech Nation. Koroye\u2019s application was so successful he was also invited to become an ambassador for Tech Nation. \u201cMy job as an ambassador is to create more awareness about the visa,\u201d Koroye said. \u201cAcross Africa, not a lot of people know about the visa, so I\u2019m here to spread awareness and give people information about their applications.\u201d\n\nAfter getting endorsed, all the professionals had to do was get their tuberculosis test results, schedule a date for biometric capturing, and submit their applications. Adedeji, who had already been living in the UK for her masters\u2019 at the time, did not have to get a tuberculosis test or buy a ticket.\n\n\u201cMy process took 5 months because it was difficult to get my tuberculosis test, but that was the only stressful part. Everything else was pretty smooth,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAnd the best part\u2026\n\nThe whole process costs about \u00a32,000, said Jones who applied with and moved with his wife.\n\nTotal amount Chika Jones spent applying for the UK Global Talent Visa\n\n\u201cBut it can be more expensive, depending on how many years you apply for, and how you\u2019re moving.\u201d The visa itself costs \u00a3623\u2014\u00a3456 for endorsement and \u00a3167 for the visa application itself. You\u2019ll also have to pay \u00a3624 per year for every year you plan to spend in the UK for up to 5 years.\n\n\u201cFor me, the costs for endorsement, health insurance and biometrics all added up to about \u00a33,500,\u201d said Adedeji.\n\nThe best part about the Global Talent Visa, according to Koroye, is that awardees don\u2019t have to be in the UK all year round. The visa only requires awardees to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every year they have applied for; the rest of the time can be spent in any country of their choosing. \u201cIt just opens you up to a more expansive world,\u201d Koroye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re open to applications from Digital Nomads. If you\u2019re an African who\u2019s travelling the world while working or living abroad for work, please send me an email at timi@bigcabal.com and sultan@bigcabal.com or fill this form.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Starting out his career as a software developer in 2001, Oluwapelumi Oyetimein realized that there was more to building a successful app than writing code. After trying his hands at other aspects of business, he decided to focus on marketing. Today, Oyetimein has made a name for himself in the industry, leading marketing and growth for several top companies.\n\nToday on How I Work, he talks about his transition from software development to marketing and how he consistently stays on top of his game.\n\nCurrent role: Marketing Lead at Umba\n\nLocation(s): Ibadan, Nigeria and Nairobi, Kenya\n\nCurrent computer: HP Omen 15\n\nCurrent mobile device: Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra\n\nDescribe how you work in one word: Remotely\n\nTell us briefly how you started out and how you got where you are today\n\nI actually started out as a developer and a lot of people don\u2019t know that. I think because over the past 10 years I\u2019ve done more of marketing, it slightly eroded into the background.\n\nI built my first website in 2001 and eventually went into proper desktop software development around 2007. But in 2011, I decided to switch to marketing.\n\nSo, I built a mobile app which got downloaded a bit, I think about 300,000 downloads at that time. And I think the turning point for me was entering a bus and seeing someone beside me using the mobile app that I built. I realized that a lot of developers who have these ideas don\u2019t learn how to build a business around it. So, I decided that I needed to figure out how proper businesses work and eventually be able to build a business on my own.\n\nI moved from development and started out with operations, then accounting, and then marketing. When I got to marketing, I said, \u201cokay, fine this, works better.\u201d And then with marketing, I started looking at what would be better for me considering my background, so I decided to stay in digital and doubled down on performance marketing and growth. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve played in the past five years now.\n\nWhat does your work entail? Walk us through a typical workday\n\nMy day starts with me going through the numbers on my different dashboards to see their performance, and then backtracking from the numbers to see what can be done to either optimize or keep stuff running.\n\nThen of course, there\u2019s the strategy and the brainstorming part. This is when I sit back and then look at what I can do differently. I have a whiteboard that I use to plan things out. Then I have a proper brainstorming session with my team where we look at the problems we can solve for the week. We sit down and take a couple of minutes to brainstorm and then start implementing that solution for the rest of the week. So it\u2019s data, strategy and then execution.\n\nAnd then of course there\u2019s the team management part where I have to work with other team members, and especially as a lead, ensuring that everybody working on the team is progressing in their own way and also delivering on what we all set out to do. I also have to manage up, because I also have bosses to whom I give updates on what we\u2019re working on and get feedback with respect to the business.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you do without?\n\nFor gadgets, the one thing that I always have with me is my phone, and then other times, my laptop. I make a joke in my circles that wherever I am with my phone and laptop, that\u2019s my office.\n\nThe tools which I use on a day to day: Google Sheets for data analysis, the entire Google Workspace, so Sheets, Slides, and Docs. But outside of Google, I use tools like Hotjar, Customer.io, Notion, and Slack. I know a lot of people try to separate work from WhatsApp, but WhatsApp as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shortcut or hack for getting things done?\n\nOne of the things I do is to ensure that everybody knows their part. If everybody knows what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, it makes your own work easier. I also take note of all the things that I have to do and then check them off as they\u2019re happening so that I have a sense of accomplishment on the things that I\u2019m doing.\n\nWhat task(s) do you dislike but still do?\n\nI hate repetitive stuff. It kills me, really, but then I still have to do them.\n\nFor example, something I\u2019m doing right now is ensuring that the campaigns we have running on Customer.io are documented properly with descriptions and all of that. It\u2019s repetitive because I have to go look at the campaign, copy and paste the link. It kills me but I still have to do it because we can\u2019t keep track without knowing what we have.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI play games, watch movies and then I sleep. Sleep is very necessary because for people who look at screens a lot, the eyes get tired.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to, watching or reading?\n\nI\u2019m rewatching Suits. For what I\u2019m listening to, I just play any of the nineties or 2000s Hip Hop playlists on YouTube Music. By the way, I rank YouTube Music over all the other ones. Apple Music comes like a distant third after YouTube and Spotify.\n\nI\u2019ve not really had time to read proper books in a while, but there are blogs that I\u2019m looking at. CXL has a very in-depth blog and Ladder.io has really growth focused blogs.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nOne is to \u201cbe at the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing\u201d. I\u2019ve always tried to live by that.\n\nThe second one is pinned to the top of my Twitter profile: \u201cDon\u2019t just show up, show up with the intention to be excellent. Don\u2019t just do stuff, do it to be the best.\u201d\n\nThe third one is that \u201ceverything is negotiable\u201d.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt was a moment of joy for stakeholders in the oil and gas industry as President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the new Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd.) on July 19.\n\nFollowing the unveiling, the NNPC became fully commercialised and transited into a limited liability company.\n\nThere are some facts to know about the new NNPC limited.\n\nIt is important to note that as an offshoot of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 which was enacted to provide for the legal, governance, the regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian Petroleum Industry, NNPC limited is expected to operate within the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is no longer referred to as Group Managing Director (GMD), but now referred to as Group Chief Executive Officer or Group CEO.\n\nThe vision of the company is: to be the dynamic global energy company of choice and its mission is reliably delivering energy while continuously creating values for all stakeholders.\n\nIn line with Section 53(1) of the PIA 2021, with the transition, the government will no longer have control over the staffing of the NNPC limited.\n\nAlso Section 53 (5) of the Act stipulates that shares of the company held by the government are not transferable or mortgaged unless approved by the government and the National Economic Council.\n\nWith the NNPC Limited coming on board, the new company will no longer be concerned with issues of petrol price determination, and subsidy.\n\nThe new NNPC limited will no longer remit funds into the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nSector 54(9) provides that the initial capitalisation of the NNPC Limited will not be less than its financial requirements to effectively discharge its commercial duties and deal with its obligations and liabilities transferred to it.\n\nThe Federal Government will put an end to funding its projects as was obtainable since its inception.\n\nAccording to the law, the company will run on a commercial basis in a profitable and efficient manner without recourse to government funds and shall declare dividends to shareholders and retain 20 per cent of profits as retained earnings, to grow its business.\n\nApart from profit-seeking, NNPC Limited is expected to operate above board by mandatorily making disclosures for every financial year.\n\nMost importantly, the NNPC Limited will be ready for an Initial Public Offer (IPO) in the next 18 months.\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari said the New NNPC would guarantee energy security, free from institutional regulation.\n\nBuhari said this at the unveiling of the Company which held at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSharing his vision for the petroleum industry reforms and the new corporate entity, the president said that his administration was keen on creating the right atmosphere to attract investment and grow the country\u2019s economy.\n\nBuhari also said that the NNPC Ltd. would play an important role in the global energy market.\n\n\u201cNNPC is mandated by the law to ensure Nigeria\u2019s national energy security is guaranteed to support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\u201d\n\nDescribing NNPC as Africa\u2019s largest national oil company by capitalization, he said that the company now had the impetus to become a self-governing entity free of government\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of the PIA 2021 have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus.\n\n\u201cAn independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\u201d\n\nHe, however, declared that NNPC Ltd. would henceforth conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said that the Buhari administration had been very clear from the onset about its desire to create a more conducive environment for the growth of the oil and gas industry.\n\nDescribing the unveiling of the new NNPC as a \u201cremarkable milestone\u201d, Sylva expressed optimism that the company would live up to its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the magnanimous provisions of the PIA, which is being unveiled at this important occasion.\n\n\u201cThe unveiling of NNPC Limited today is a new dawn in the quest for growth and development of the Nigerian oil and gas industry, opening new vintages for partnerships,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nIn the meantime, NNPC Ltd. announced plans to aggressively grow its petroleum products retail outlets across the country by 174 per cent; that indicates an increase from the current 547 to 1,500 in the next six months.\n\nThis development was to keep to its new focus on commercial viability and profitability in the pursuit of its mandate to provide energy security for Nigeria.\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, made the announcement at the presidential unveiling of the new NNPC as provided by the PIA 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a strategic initiative to achieve our mandate of ensuring energy security for our country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow our oil retail outlets from 547 to over 1,500 within the next six months,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nOn the prospects of the new NNPC, he said that the Company was primed to succeed considering the array of talents, skills and professionals in its employ, adding:\n\n\u201cNNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world.\u201d\n\nWith the new commercial focus and corporate identity, NNPC would now be regulated in line with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nAlso in the week, the GCEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, called for concerted and urgent action as well as collaboration among the national oil companies of member countries of the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) to tackle the energy poverty in Africa.\n\nKyari gave the charge at the 2nd Meeting of Chief Executive Officers of the National Oil Companies of APPO Member Countries hosted by NNPC Ltd in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the grinding energy poverty across the African continent does not call for long talks and Power-Point presentations anymore but concrete actions and collaborative efforts on the part of the national oil companies to make energy available for economic development.\n\n\u201cWe must develop local capacity. They are all under enormous stress not to do business with us.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to talk, we must act. Time is running out, I must confess. We must realise that we don\u2019t have time for talking; we need to act, and act very quickly so that we can help our people out of poverty by creating prosperity.\n\nHe listed some areas that required urgent action and collaboration to include access to capital, demand for energy justice, and establishment of regional infrastructure.\n\nKyari stressed that a number of cross-country gas infrastructure were already springing up across the continent.\n\nHe explained that to put up regional infrastructure, as it was already happening in the Central Africa Pipeline Network, the NNPC Ltd. started the promotion of the Nigeria-Morocco Pipeline that would run through nine African countries.\n\nSpeaking earlier in his welcome address, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said the Meeting of Chief Executive Officers of the National Oil Companies of APPO Member Countries was revived by the Ministerial Council of APPO.\n\nSylva said the revival was in recognition of the critical role the national oil companies needed to play in ensuring the survival of the oil and gas industry in Africa, in the face of the changing global energy landscape.\n\nHe said that the challenges posed by the global energy transition required a practical approach on the part of operators and policy makers to fashion out a unified action plan for the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe require a completely new approach; an approach that is both inclusive and pragmatic.\n\n\u201cThe policy makers as well as the operators have crucial roles to play in achieving this.\n\n\u201cWe need you to tell us the practical challenges you face today and are likely to face in the years to come.\n\n\u201cThese practical realities should constitute major inputs into the policy-making process of the political leadership.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Secretary-General of APPO, Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim, also spoke on the steps being taken by the organisation to develop requisite local technology across member countries.\n\nStill in the week under review, the Management of the NNPC Gas Marketing Company Limited (NGMC) pledged to remain focused on the implementation of its core mandates while taking into consideration concerns of key stakeholders.\n\nThe Managing Director of NGMC, Mr Justin Ezeala made the commitment at the headquarters of the company in Abuja during an oversight visit to the company by the House of Representatives Committee on Gas Resources.\n\nEzeala assured that NGMC would work assiduously towards addressing some of the issues raised by the committee regarding host community development.\n\n\u201cWe have taken note of all your concerns and we will address them.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure you that you don\u2019t need to invite us to report to you, it is our duty to report to you as part of our commitment to accountability.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier on the objective of the oversight visit, Chairman of the Committee, Rep. Nicolas Mutu, said the visit was to ascertain the progress made in facilitating gas penetration across the country to boost economic development.\n\nMutu said the committee was prepared to use every legislative means to encourage gas penetration in Nigeria and would like to use the visit to learn about NGML\u2019s plan for LPG distribution.\n\nHe expressed delight and commended the management and staff of NGMC for the warm reception accorded members of the committee.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "7 Expert Tips To Help You Win In Apex Legends",
          "text": "Are you a big fan of Apex Legends? If so, then you must be aware that the competition level of Apex Legends is insane, and with the growing number of participants, winning in this game is becoming even more difficult. But still, players are constantly engaging in the game, and if you are a dedicated player, you can win the game.\n\nLooking at the high competition and the game\u2019s vastness, it becomes very important to know all the best tips and tricks to win the game. Let\u2019s see how.\n\nWhat is Apex Legends?\n\nReleased for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game. It was developed by Respawn Entertainment, published by Electronic Arts, and released on February 4, 2019. It is a team and hero-based royale that allows 60 players to drop down onto the same map. They get to loot and fight till all the teams give up and only one team is left standing.\n\nHow to win in Apex legends?\n\nSince we have understood the basics of this game, let us now have a quick look at how to win this game. It is important to keep improving your strategies and note what is working for you and others during the game.\n\n1. Good Landing and Advantageous Positioning\n\nLearning how to drop properly is an important aspect of the game. Especially if you are landing in a hot zone, you need to run faster than other teams. Keep in mind that you have to loot swiftly, without wasting any time. Please remember not to go back for a second loot at any cost.\n\nDo not undermine the importance of good positioning, as it can give you an advantage over your enemies. You can also look out for better covers to save your team from enemy fire and plan an escape route if things go wrong with the battle.\n\n2. Learning to Play Aggressively\n\nApex Legends rewards the players and the more aggressive teams. However, you will notice that with time, the ring becomes smaller in size forcing the players to confront each other. So instead of popping out of your cover, you need to practice closing on your enemies and engaging in a straight gun battle with them.\n\n3. Knowledge of Legends and Team Combination\n\nIt is crucial to survey the background by gaining knowledge of the legends. Additionally, one needs to have a clear idea of their weapons and abilities as it will allow you to be more prepared once you are on the battlefield.\n\nOne good mobility-focused ability can always make the game easier for you and your entire team. You can choose quick repositioning, as it increases your chance of survival. Some scouts like Seer and Crypto can assist you in winning the game, as they can highlight threats in advance.\n\nBefore the match begins, memorize your teammates\u2019 legends and skins. This is especially helpful when the name tags of the players disappear, which makes it insanely difficult to distinguish between friends and foes.\n\n4. Learn How to Use the Best Equipment for Different Scenarios\n\nTo begin with, you need one automatic weapon, and you need to cover all the distances with your two guns. But it would help if you also had certain attachments for these guns, without which they won\u2019t function properly.\n\nIt would be best if you choose your weapon according to the range of your fight. For short-range, shotguns work best. For mid-range and long-range, you will need R-301 Carbine or Charge Rifle, respectively. Besides, use Evo Shields to save yourself from the enemy\u2019s fire.\n\nThere are quite some gears in the game. While some give you more points for killing your enemies, others let you heal yourself. So, you need to choose the ones that best serve your purpose.\n\n5. Realize the Importance of Playing Defense Also\n\nAlthough it is advised to play aggressively at the beginning of the game, if the number of players in your team dwindles and you feel that you are not in a great position to continue with your fight, it is better to hold your position than advance.\n\nIt is better to remember that splitting the team doesn\u2019t help. Even if you are playing aggressively, you need cover-fire near you as a team. If you find no cover for you, it implies that you\u2019re in a disadvantageous position, and you need to play defensively then.\n\n6. Awareness of When not to Fight During the Game\n\nIt is important to scrutinize your position during the battle and decide on the future course of action. For instance, when a few teams are remaining, your team needs to make a staunch decision if you want to fight or not.\n\nBesides, since the ring of the game contracts and becomes more damaging over time, you also need to decide if you should be moving to the next circle or not. Moreover, as a player, you can third-party a fight, but you need to choose the team with the highest chance of winning, as choosing a weak team will bring you to your downfall.\n\n7. Continuous Communication With the Team Members\n\nTo finish the game successfully, you need to communicate with your remaining team members. There are advanced features regarding the pinging system, and be aware of them before you start playing. You can always use the voice chat feature and be in constant touch with your teammates. They should feel your presence over the chat but ensure that engaging them in the chatting process doesn\u2019t hinder concentration in the game itself.\n\nTo ensure a smooth running of the game, you need to ask your teammates about their settings. However, all the players should try to adhere to a single setting only, which increases coordination among the players, and enhances your chances of winning the game.\n\nAre There Any Hacks and Cheats in Apex Legend?\n\nThere are several Apex Legends cheats that can be used to win in Apex Legends. However, it is important to use them wisely as they can get you banned from the game. These hacks generally include using the game\u2019s map to one\u2019s advantage or using an aimbot to kill more enemies and even a wallhack to spot enemies by seeing through walls.\n\nEventually, it all depends on how the user manages to win the game without entirely relying on the hacks and tricks. However, with practice and a better understanding of the game, it can be won easily.\n\nSummary\n\nApex Legends is one of the popular games among gamers who like to indulge in shooting. It functions by keeping the gamers engaged and excited when they play. Winning in this game can be important to gamers who have devoted their time and energy to excel.\n\nIt is important to get the right combination of characters, picking the right gun, movement, and communication if you like to win.",

This was shared during the 2-day hybrid event held on July 13-14, 2022, at the prestigious Transcorp Hilton Hotel Abuja which had about 4,000 registered delegates from 55 countries.\n\nGiving a keynote address at the event on the theme, \u2018Rethink, Rebuild, Recover, Accelerating Growth for the SDGs\u2019, Mr. Schmale noted that the theme was apt, timely, relevant, and required given the economic regression across Africa occasioned by the pandemic, the volatilities caused by the Ukraine war and the fact there was just 8 years to go before 2030. He commended the leadership of the Sterling One Foundation stressing that there was need for intensive collaborations and partnerships among African leaders across the public and private sectors including the civil society groups to aid the achievement of not just the 2030 goals but also, the African Union\u2019s 2063 goals.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Mrs. Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO, Sterling One Foundation, noted that the summit had in-depth and insightful panel sessions on climate action, education access and funding, primary healthcare, youth and gender empowerment, impact investment and governance which all give a good appreciation of the 17 interlinked global goals.\n\nShe added that a recurring resolution that came through in all the panel sessions was the need for elimination of silo executions and embracing of collaborations by all sector players. Financing strategies, impact measurement and evaluation of such impact was also discussed as\n\nit was clear that the SDGs require financing to become a reality with an estimated amount of $1.3 trillion annually in Africa as shared by the UN and over $300 billion to block the gap in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cVarious deals from 4 African countries were brought to the summit\u2019s Deal Room with innovative solutions that cut across the education, health, construction, renewable energy, and food security sectors. Most of these businesses already have conditional commitments from our investors at the event and we expect to seal these deals in the coming weeks working with the investees. We will continue facilitating financing for purpose and profit driven business solutions that will help promote access to health and education for all while guaranteeing returns for impact investors locally and globally\u2019\u2019, she added.\n\nShe noted that the Foundation was already working with various partners and will continue in this light as the event was organized in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact Network Nigeria, Sterling Bank, the Coca Cola Company, VFD Group, the Impact Investors Foundation, Giving.ng, the Nigeria Climate Innovation Center (NCIC), the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Ventures Africa, Proshare and Tech Cabal.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it has been implementing measures aimed at encouraging more listings by creating new Rules and amending existing ones, improving general review processes, continuing engagements with issuers, advisers and other critical stakeholders.\n\nDirector General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda who stated this recently at the Nigeria Exchange Limited\u2019s CEO Roundtable held in Lagos, said the Commission and the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited have moved to make the processes involved in listing more efficient and cost effective by streamlining the approval process between the SEC and the NGX.\n\nYuguda stated that last year, the Commission collaborated with Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, NECA to inaugurate the Securities Issuers Forum (SIF) which was aimed at providing an opportunity for Issuers to engage directly with regulators on pertinent regulatory issues. The objectives of the forum, amongst others he said, are to maintain regular contact with the regulator; promote sound corporate governance and ethical conduct; advise the regulator on regulations affecting companies & issuers; promote healthy competition; and maintain an enabling business environment by monitoring issues of direct relevance to members.\n\nHe said, \u201clet me reiterate that the SEC is continually focused on increasing the visibility and attractiveness of our market, and will continue to focus on building and sustaining a fair, transparent and efficient capital market.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will also continue to embrace the ease-of-doing-business principle by simplifying its processes and enhancing time-to-market through the elimination of superfluous requirements that lead to inordinate delays in capital raising and other capital market operations. This is particularly important so that the market be deepened further and provide avenue for hitherto inadmissible entities to be eligible for listing\u201d.\n\nThe SEC Boss said the theme \u201cCreating the enabling ecosystem for accessing capital from the Nigerian capital markets, resonates with the mandate of the Securities and Exchange Commission of developing and regulating the market while protecting investors.\n\nHe stated that the demutualization of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which led to the emergence of the current NGX Group has brought with it a renewed focus on expanding the market, by consolidating on the successes achieved through the traditional methods of capital raising while working with important stakeholders to introduce new sources of financing.\n\n\u201cThe Commission welcomes the sound initiatives of NGX for continued engagement with experts to share their perspectives on changes that would lead to the much desired expansion of the market. This effort would not have come at a better time than now when economies are just beginning to face the devastating economic reality of the Ukraine and Russia crisis, which reared its head, just as nations were still grappling with the health and economic challenges posed by the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n\n\u201cYou may be aware that the Commission is in the implementation phase of a comprehensive market and institutional reform program \u2013 the Capital Market Masterplan that is intended to reposition the Nigerian Capital Market to be globally competitive. The Commission has successfully completed a comprehensive review of the Masterplan. The reviewed plan is expected to guide further development of the capital market so as to attract more funds for economic growth and development\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Commission the SEC DG said, is also making concerted efforts to ensure the repeal of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA) 2007 and the passage of a new Investments and Securities Bill into law. This is to align the law with current realities and global trends in capital market regulation, including growing changes in market practices, processes and products.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently focussed on the creation of an ecosystem in which governments, entrepreneurs and other issuers can efficiently access capital. Stakeholders must however look further to introduce more products, leveraging on the emerging trend of financial technology\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "He said, \u201clet me reiterate that the SEC is continually focused on increasing the visibility and attractiveness of our market, and will continue to focus on building and sustaining a fair, transparent and efficient capital market.\n\u201cYou may be aware that the Commission is in the implementation phase of a comprehensive market and institutional reform program \u2013 the Capital Market Masterplan that is intended to reposition the Nigerian Capital Market to be globally competitive.\nThe reviewed plan is expected to guide further development of the capital market so as to attract more funds for economic growth and development\u201d he stated.\nThis is to align the law with current realities and global trends in capital market regulation, including growing changes in market practices, processes and products.\n\u201cWe have consistently focussed on the creation of an ecosystem in which governments, entrepreneurs and other issuers can efficiently access capital.",

          "text": "A new video released by terrorists shows abducted passengers of an Abuja-Kaduna train service being tortured by their captors.\n\nThe heart-rending video circulating on Sunday showed the terrorists flogging their victims mercilessly. They threatened to kill the captives.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked the Kaduna-bound passenger train, killing eight people and abducting 63. Many others were wounded.\n\nAfter a series of releases for ransom, 43 Nigerians are still held by the terrorists somewhere within the Birnin Gwari forest in Kaduna.\n\nIn the viral video recorded in Hausa, the terrorists threatened to kidnap Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari and Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, as well as other government officials.\n\nThe terrorists claimed the government knows what their demands are, and if not met, they will enslave the captives and sell the rest \u201cjust like the Chibok girls.\u201d\n\nThey also vowed to \u201cturn this place to a slaughterhouse\u201d if they are not appeased.\n\nThe terrorists also said they know of a plan by the Nigerian government to storm their hideout \u201cwith guns and planes.\u201d\n\nWHAT THEY SAID\n\nThis is the result of what the bad Nigerian government has caused for her people.\n\nLook at it very well. It\u2019s not our intention to do this but this is what the Nigerian government has caused.\n\nWe have tried to dialogue with the Nigerian government some time ago in Kaduna to release the abducted victims but the FG seems relaxed \u2013 having their tea.\n\nThe FG should know that we are aware that there\u2019s no committee being set up to fast track the release of the victims. We know that you are planning to forcefully rescue the victims using guns and planes.\n\nYour guns and your planes are spider webs in the sight of Allah.\n\nWe are fighting for the cause of Allah. We don\u2019t fear anybody. We only fear Allah. We have pledge solidarity to Allah. We will carryout whatever Allah says we should.\n\nThis is small compared to what you will see. Just as we have told you in times past \u2013 if our demands are not met, we will turn this area into a slaughterhouse\u2026\n\nThis is our message to the government of Nigeria and just as you have seen these people here, by God\u2019s grace, you will see your leaders; your senators and governors will come before us.\n\nThese ones you see here, we will keep some as our slaves and sell them off just as our Imam told you in the past.\n\nJust like the Chibok girls that were sold off, we will equally sell these ones as slaves\u2026\n\nIf you don\u2019t adhere to our demands, we will kill the ones we need to kill and sell the remaining. By God\u2019s grace, El-Rufai, Buhari, we will bring you here.\n\nEXCLUSIVE DETAILS\n\nARISE News spoke to a family member of one of the abductees who would rather be anonymous.\n\nHe said the terrorists contacted him within the past week and told him that two of the captives are seriously ill from wound infections.\n\nThe terrorists told him to come get them both, as long as he comes with food and water.\n\nExcited at the prospect of securing his loved ones\u2019 freedom, he loaded his car with food and water for the captives and set out for Birnin Gwari from Kaduna.\n\nHowever, some family members of other captives got wind of the plan, and weren\u2019t too pleased he was negotiating for just his own relatives.\n\nAccording to the source, he was barely 30 minutes from the location given to him by the terrorists in Birnin Gwari, when he was stopped at a military checkpoint.\n\nThey had \u201cinformation from headquarters\u201d that someone was coming with ransom for the terrorists.\n\nHe told them to check the car, that all he had was food and water, not cash.\n\nNonetheless, he was detained for hours, then sent back.\n\nBACKSTORY\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked a Kaduna-bound passenger train, killing eight people and abducting 63 others. Many others were wounded.\n\nOne of the abducted victims, the managing director of the Nigerian Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Hassan, was released about a week later, after reportedly paying a ransom of N100 million.\n\nA pregnant woman was also released, before another 11 were set free early June.\n\nOn July 9, Seven of 50 remaining abductees were released.\n\nReports in local media claim the terrorists were paid N800 million; N100 million for each of the six Nigerians released, and N200 million for the Pakistani captive.\n\nHowever, Tukur Mamu who negotiated their release \u2013 as well as previous negotiations with the terrorists \u2013 insisted that no ransom was paid.\n\nMamu is publisher of the Desert Herald and a media consultant to popular Kaduna-based Islam cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\n\nDemola Ojo, Nissi Gabriel",

Natasha Fouts, a spokeswoman for CalFire, said officials don\u2019t expect to contain the fire until next week.\n\nLocals described evacuating their homes with the flames approaching and one shoeless elderly man attempting to flee the blaze on Friday was rescued by firefighters after crashing his car into a ditch.\n\nThe scale of the evacuation means it is proving challenging to find accommodation for all those seeking shelter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re full with evacuees,\u201d Alyssa Wildt, a local hotel owner, told the LA Times.\n\n\u201cToday we have a bunch of fire crews looking for rooms,\u201d Ms Wildt added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have them. I believe most of town is full.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the blaze marks an ominous start to California\u2019s wildfire season and officials have warned that a combination of drought, climate change, and overgrown vegetation are posing significant challenges and increasing the chances of the fire spreading rapidly.\n\nMuch of the United States is sweltering through a heatwave and heat advisory warnings are in effect in more than a dozen states. Temperatures in Mariposa County hit 96F (35.5C) on Saturday, and are expected to stay at that level for the next few days.\n\nYosemite National Park, which lies to the north-east of where Oak Fire is burning, is home to some of the largest and oldest sequoia trees in the world. The redwoods were threatened by another blaze earlier this month, but firefighters managed to save them.\n\nThe US Forest Service said on Friday it is taking emergency measures to protect the trees, including removing low-lying vegetation that can fuel fires and other measures.\n\nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n\nSeveral European governments have struggled to contain dozens of separate wildfires which have ripped across the continent in recent weeks.\n\nBBC",
