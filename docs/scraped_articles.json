          "text": "Yiaga Africa, on Tuesday, said the high cost of nomination forms being charged by political parties in preparation for the 2023 general elections was used to allegedly marginalise the youth, women, and persons with disability from political participation.\n\nThe Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, stated this in a statement titled, \u2018Yiaga Africa Expresses Concern At The Exorbitant Cost Of Nomination Forms By Political Parties For The 2023 General Elections\u2019.\n\nHe added that the passage of the Not Too Young To Run Bill into law before the 2019 general elections had raised hopes of the youth, but it was surprising major political parties were charging exorbitant prices for nomination forms.\n\n\u201cGoing by the high cost of nomination forms that have been announced so far by some political parties ahead of the 2023 general elections, it is safe to say that this is a deliberate attempt to marginalize women, youth, and persons living with disabilities (PWDs) from participating in the political process as candidates in the forthcoming general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe note that this is a huge disservice to teeming young Nigerians and women who nurse the ambition to run for elective office in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to state that this practice does not bode well for Nigeria\u2019s fledgling democracy as it further marginalizes women, youth, and persons living with disabilities and seeks to undermine the emergence of young men and women candidates in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThese groups make up the largest demographic in the country from participating in the political process, with young people constituting over 60% of Nigeria\u2019s population and 54% of registered voters.\n\n\u201cThe expensive nature of Nigeria\u2019s politics has been established to be a structural barrier to women and youth political participation; thus, it is saddening to see that political parties, which remain the primary medium for contesting elections in the country, continue to perpetuate this injustice.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the concessions made by some political parties to women, youth, and PWDs and call for a further downward review of the cost of nomination forms to allow for an inclusive process without discrimination against any group or demography of the society.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin, Sanni Onogu, and John Ofikhenua, Abuja\n\nBuhari\u2019s, Jonathan\u2019s aides disagree\n\nLawan, Sylva, Ayade pick forms\n\nCourt to rule on Emefiele\u2019s request\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan Monday night rejected the presidential nomination form obtained for him by a group, the Nomadic Herders and Almajiris Community in Nigeria.\n\nHe said he did not authorise any group to purchase the form for him.\n\nDr Jonathan, in a statement by his Media Adviser Ikechukwu Eze posted on his Facebook page at about midnight, said he was not aware of the move.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIt has come to the notice of His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the All Progressives Congress (the APC), in his name.\n\n\u201cWe wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorize it.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 Presidential election, we wish to state that he has not in any way, committed himself to this request.\n\n\u201cWe thank the general public for their concern, as we continue to encourage citizen participation in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nBefore the rebuttal by the former president, controversy trailed the nomination form purchase.\n\nThe group, led by one Ibrahim Abdullahi, claimed that it had picked the form for the former president.\n\nOne of the former president\u2019s aides, Reno Omokri, said it would be difficult to shave the head of a person in his absence.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cFirst of all, to whet your appetite, let me say that under the rain and under the sun, I will follow Jonathan.\n\n\u201cSecondly, I can\u2019t ever be one with APC. Thirdly, nobody can shave HE @GEJonathan\u2019s head in his absence. Read between the lines. More to come!\u201d\n\nBut, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s spokesman on New Media, Bashir Ahmad in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle at about 8:35 pm, said: \u201cSo, Goodluck Jonathan has dumped the opposition PDP and now a member of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d\n\nIn a telephone chat with The Nation, Ahmad explained that all circumstances pointed to the fact that the former President would be seeking to return to the office on the platform of the party that removed him from office in 2015.\n\nAccording to him, a political party would sell nomination and expression of interest forms to only its registered member.\n\nHe added: \u201cNo one will give out N100 million to buy a presidential form from a party he\u2019s not a member of. The primary reason for parties to sell their forms to you is that you must first be a registered member,\u201d Ahmad argued.\n\nThree chieftains also yesterday joined the presidential race, raising the number of contenders to 25.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan, Minister of State for Petroleum Timipre Sylva and Cross Rivers State Governor Ben Ayade obtained the forms.\n\nPastor Tunde Bakare, who picked the form last week, unfolded his plans in Abuja.\n\nAlso yesterday, frontline aspirant Asiwaju Bola Tinubu intensified his consultation and mobilisation, wooing party delegates in Katsina.\n\nRecently the former President while hosting some women and youths who came to persuade him to contest the 2023 election, told them the process of his joining the race was in progress.\n\nAddressing reporters after picking the form, Abdullahi said: \u201cI represent two of the most vulnerable communities in our country. The nomadic pastoralist and the almajirai communities have decided to purchase this form for our former president, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to come back and rule this country and continue with the good work he has started.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, he was the first President since the independence of Nigeria who has found it expedient, who was magnanimous enough to remember the almajiri community. He brought a comprehensive policy of reformation and integration of the almajirai into the mainstream educational system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt was the dream and the vision of President Goodluck Jonathan that if that programme had continued it would one day produce from the Almajiri system of education doctors and engineers. Unfortunately, that programme was kept aside as soon as he left.\n\n\u201cOther parts of the vulnerable community that Goodluck Jonathan wanted to give a sense of belonging was the Fulani community, the nomadic pastoralist.\u201d\n\nThe nomadic leader said the good work of the former President made them sell their cows to raise the money for the purchase of the forms.\n\nOn the party membership status of the former President, the Fulani leader said: \u201cYes President Goodluck Jonathan is a member of APC.\u201d\n\nThe nomination form for the Senate President was purchased by a group of friends in the ruling APC, led by Chief Sam Nkire, a member of the National Caucus and 15 senators. Sylva\u2019s form was picked by a group of friends, led by Alhaji Sulaiman Abdullahi.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after collecting the nomination forms for the Senate President, Nkire said the Lawan\u2019s antecedents qualified him for the prime job.\n\nNkire, who hails from Abia State dismissed the argument for zoning, saying: \u201cEvery politician is in politics to win. We don\u2019t want PDP to take the government from us.\n\n\u201cIf you give the position to a Southerner and PDP gives a Northerner, APC will go into the wilderness. I\u2019m not ready to go to the wilderness.\u201d\n\nSuleiman Abdullahi, spokesman of Northern Solidarity Group for Timipre Sylva, said nomination forms were picked for the minister based on his competence and antecedent.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe picked this presidential nomination forms to surprise the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, to contest for the presidency of this country, which we found him capable to do. We are his fans from the Northern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians can see from his antecedent from the state level to the federal level that he has garnered necessary experience and is well accepted across the country. So we know that his chances of winning the ticket of the APC are brighter.\u201d\n\nSylva promised to consult Ijaw National leader, Chief Edwin Clark, and other leaders before deciding to run.\n\nHe said he would commence the consultation in his constituency.\n\nSpeaking at the entrance of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited Towers, Abuja, where the form was presented to him, he said he was humbled and shocked to realise that the group appreciated his efforts.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am humbled and shocked that my efforts have been noticed by you Nigerians. And that you Nigerians by yourself you go and take the trouble of obtaining the nomination and the expression of interest form for me.\n\n\u201cIt is very humbling and I must also say that I am very happy and pleased by this gesture.\n\n\u201cI need to consult my constituency and consult the leaders of this country and then I will come back to you to let you know if I have taken the position to run for this contest.\n\n\u201cYou will give me a very short time. I will start right away the consultation and will go to my leaders, for example, the Ijaw leader, Sir EK Clark.\n\n\u201cI will talk to him. I will also consult other leaders of the country and I will get back to you.\u201d\n\nA member of the group leader, Alhaji Mohammed Abu Abaji, said since the minister has been in the saddle, the oil and gas industry has not been threatened by Niger Delta agitators.\n\nLawan joins APC\u2019s Presidential race\n\nLawan, after receiving the forms, said he had consulted widely and promised to play the game by the rules.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday is a special day and this moment is very memorable and historic. Over the last seven years, we have been participants in the administration of our country at the national level.\n\n\u201cI have listened to various calls from all parts of our dear country, our dear nation Nigeria, for me to show interest to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI took my time to pray to almighty God to guide me. I took my time to consult very widely, consult Nigerians from all parts of the country to ensure that I get the understanding of the citizens of this country on whose behalf we will, by the Grace of God, win the election and run the administration.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs to be taken to the next level. We know what we have been able to achieve as an administration and as a political party and we know where we are supposed to take this level to eventually.\n\n\u201cI want to commit myself to this call and this movement of Nigerians from all walks of life, rich, poor, north, south, east, west, male, female, old and young.\n\n\u201cThis is not my journey. This is our journey. This is our journey because every hand must be on deck for us to achieve exactly what we need to achieve.\n\n\u201cI am joining lately. The field is already full of other aspirants. I want, at this point, to assure Nigerians that the APC is a very beautiful bride and that is why we have many aspirants.\n\nChief Whip Orji Kalu, yesterday, withdrew from the race. He said he would be supporting Lawan to succeed the president.\n\nKalu in a statement in Abuja said: \u201cI congratulate my friend, former roommate and boss, Senator Ahmad Lawan, as he picks form to run for President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under our great party, All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cI am most glad because he is from the Northeast, the only zone alongside the Southeast that is yet to produce the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained an unambiguous stand that for justice, equity and fairness in our country, the next President of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari should come from the Southeast or the Northeast.\n\n\u201cI have also told Nigerians that I would only run for the office of President if the two major political parties (APC and PDP) zone their tickets to the Southeast.\n\n\u201cThat is why I was disappointed with our Southern brothers who are talking about fairness and equity but have zero tolerance for the same fairness and equity in the South.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a South Easterner being President of Nigeria in 2023, I have my full support for a North Easterner. This is because it would be the closest to the equity, fairness and justice everyone is talking about. It further means that justice is on its way to the Southeast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank those who said they have picked presidential form for me because they meant well for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHowever, since there is no zoning and the contest is open to all Nigerians, I officially withdraw from the presidential contest in 2023.\n\n\u201cI have also picked a ticket to run for Abia North Senatorial zone and to complete the good work I started in Abia North.\n\n\u201cI urge all my friends, allies and supporters in the APC to toe the line of justice by supporting Senator Ahmad Lawan, a North Easterner for the presidential ticket of the APC.\u201d\n\nAyade expressed confidence that he \u201cwill be the next president of this country\u201d.\n\nHe said he would engage Nigerians on the \u201cbasis of what I have done and not on promises and not on statistics\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would do so with videos and pictures so that those who don\u2019t know would know,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke shortly after he received his nomination and Expression of Interest (EOI) forms purchased for him by sons and daughters of Cross River State, Arewa Youths as well as other interest groups across the country\u2019s six geopolitical zones.\n\nAyade said he would replicate his successes as a state governor at the national level and help address the country\u2019s myriad of challenges.\n\n\u201cI thank all of you who have contributed to the purchase of these forms, your money will not go in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nAyade said: \u201cGreat Nigerians citizens, I come before you not as a politician but as a system purifier.\n\n\u201cI understand the challenges of this country and that as Ph.D student, as somebody who is a professor, I have an intellectual potency to my professorship.\u201d\n\nThe governor said as a senator, he sponsored 41 bills \u2013 the highest in the Seventh Republic and transformed the state despite meeting a gross debt profile of over N382 billion.",

          "text": "By Willy Eya\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has joined the presidential race on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as he, yesterday, purchased the N100 million expression of interest and nomination forms in Abuja.\n\nSaturday Sun had on April 30 exclusively reported that Lawan would join the race after the last Sallah holiday, having been picked by northern elders as preferred aspirant.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHis entry into the already crowded race has sent jitters into the camps of aspirants from the Southern part of the country. By picking the presidential form, the Senate President has further increased the number of northerners on the platform of the APC that have shown interests to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nA highly placed member of the ruling party told Daily Sun that in addition to his connection to the presidency, Lawan is now the new bride of some powerful northern elders and power brokers who want him to succeed Buhari next year. He said the support is because of his wealth of experience in public service and the advantage of age being on his side.\n\nOur source said his background and acceptability among the Northern elite is a major headache to the array of aspirants in the South.\n\nThe development has confirmed The Sun\u2019s report that Southern presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC were in a dilemma over the increasing number of opponents from the North.\n\nDaily Sun had also reported that many stakeholders from the South were particularly worried because of reports that Northern aspirants were being encouraged to join the race by President Buhari.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAspirants from the South were said to be in a dilemma as their chances are becoming slimmer by the day with the overt interest of aspirants from the North.\n\nBefore now, all the APC presidential aspirants, apart from the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello were from the South. But at the last count, Northerners aspiring to succeed Buhari on the APC platform include Governor Muhammadu Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State, former governor of Zamfara State, Senator Sani Yerima, Gbenga Olawapo-Hashim, Dr. Ibrahim Bello Dauda and now Ahmed Lawan.\n\nTo purchase the forms on behalf of Lawan, APC chieftain, Chief Sam Nkire, who stormed the International Conference Centre, Abuja, venue for the sale of forms in the company of some senators, said they were supporting the Senate president for national stability.\n\n\u201cWe want him to be president because of national stability. The president that we are bringing for the Nigerian people is a Nigerian president, not an Igbo president, not a Fulani president, not a Yoruba president, but a Nigerian president who we have watched and seen that there would be no other candidate that will be so level-headed and have feeling for the poor Nigerians.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAsked if Lawan has heeded the call to serve, he replied: \u201cWe are not here on our own, we have his backing. Even though friends and brothers contributed to purchase this form for him, he has given us the go-ahead.\u201d\n\nOn whether the party\u2019s zoning arrangement is no longer standing, he said: \u201cEvery politician is in politics to win. It is PDP that is driving us to do this. We have to say so but we don\u2019t want PDP to take the government from us. If you give the position to a Southerner and PDP gives to a Northerner, APC will go into the wilderness and we are not ready to go into the wilderness.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Lawan said he had consulted widely and listened to various calls from all parts of the country to show interest to run for the office.\n\n\u201cI took my time to pray to almighty God to guide me. I took my time to consult very widely, consult Nigerians from all parts of the country to ensure that I get the understanding of the citizens of this country on whose behalf we will, by the Grace of God, win the election and run the administration.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs to be taken to the next level. We know what we have been able to achieve as an administration and as a political party and we know where we are supposed to take this level to eventually.\n\n\u201cI want to commit myself to this call and to this movement of Nigerians from all walks of life, rich, poor, north, south, east, west, male, female, old and young.\n\n\u201cThis is not my journey. This is our journey. This is our journey because every hand must be on deck for us to achieve exactly what we need to achieve.\n\n\u201cI am joining lately. The field is already full of other aspirants. I want, at this point, to assure Nigerians that the APC is a very beautiful bride and that is why we have many aspirants.\n\n\u201cI will play the game by the rules. I am not going to circumvent any rule. I\u2019m going to respect my party and listen to the leaders of this party because that is our platform in the first place.\n\n\u201cBut I will spare no moment going from door to door to ensure that I get the votes when the national convention to elect the presidential candidate of the part will hold.\u201d",

The meeting, THISDAY gathered, took place few hours after a Fulani group, under the aegis of the Nomadic Pastoralists and the Almajiri Communities, purchased the ruling party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, sold for N100 million, for Jonathan. They urged him to contest for president under the party in 2023.\n\nThe sale of forms for elective positions in APC closes today, with 25 aspirants in the race for the presidential ticket in the party\u2019s primary election slated for May 30, 2023.\n\nLikewise, 72 hours after a coalition of 28 groups bought the N100 million APC forms for the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, he is yet to deny that he nurses presidential ambition. The AfDB president also met with President Muhammadu Buhari in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, during the ongoing conference organised by the United Nations.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu held at a secret location in Abuja and lasted about an hour, specifically between 9pm and 10 pm. At the end of it, the former president and the national chairman came out smiling, THISDAY learnt. Although the agenda of the meeting was not disclosed, it further strengthened speculation about the former president\u2019s likely defection to the APC which has been topic of discussion in political circles in the last two years.\n\nJonathan, in a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, said he was not aware of the purchase of forms and did not authorise it.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt has come to the notice of His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the APC in his name.\n\n\u201cWe wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 presidential election, we wish to state, that he has not in anyway, committed himself to this request.\n\n\u201cWe thank the general public for their concern, as we continue to encourage citizens\u2019 participation in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nA reliable source had told THISDAY that some leaders in West Africa, which included presidents of Niger, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, might have spoken on behalf of the AfDB president to Buhari.\n\nThere had been speculations that Jonathan wanted to take another shot at the presidency but on the platform of APC, the party that defeated him in 2015. The former president recently hinted that he was still consulting on whether to join the race or not in 2023.\n\nThe leader of the Fulani group that purchased the form for Jonathan, Ibrahim Abdullahi, said a lot of interest groups had been coming out to urge Jonathan to contest, adding that they needed to purchase the form to beat the deadline.\n\nHe said Jonathan had a comprehensive policy while in government to reform and integrate the Almajarai into the educational system of Nigeria.\n\nAbdullahi added, \u201cIt was the dream and the vision of President Jonathan to produce doctors, lawyers and engineers from Almajarai, but unfortunately, that laudable vision was abandoned once he left office.,\n\n\u201cAnother group that he tried to develop was the Fulani pastoralists. I believe if this government has continued with his vision, Nigeria would have become the Denmark, the Holland of the entire Africa, in terms of livestock production, in terms of milk, beef and so on.\u201d\n\nSale of Forms Closes Today, 25 Presidential Aspirants Jostle for APC Ticket\n\nThe sale of APC forms closes today, according to the timetable and schedule of activities of the ruling party, and submission of forms begins tomorrow.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that one of presidential hopefuls, Senator Bola Tinubu, would submit his nomination forms tomorrow.\n\nThe aspirants that have purchased forms so far are: former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Senator representing Ondo-North senatorial district, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice; Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon.

Ayade said he was confident of becoming the next president of Nigeria.\n\nHe said he \u201cwill be next president of this country.\u201d\n\nAyade said he would replicate his successes as a state governor at the national level and help address the country\u2019s myriad of challenges.\n\nOn his part, Bakare who formally declared in Abuja, yesterday, said his administration would attract a $2 trillion Foreign and Direct Investment (FDI) to the Nigerian economy. He said as president, his administration would deliver in four mandates namely: peace, progress; prosperity and possibilities.\n\nBakare explained that the Peace Mandate would achieve policy thrust on nationhood leadership, governance and national security, while the Progress Mandate would cater for sectors like education, healthcare, family and social development.\n\nHe added that the prosperity mandate would focus on economic management and infrastructural, while possibilities mandate would focus on science, technology and innovation; foreign policy, sustainability; arts, culture, entertainment and sports.\n\nThe spokesman of the Northern Solidarity Group for Timipre Sylva, Suleiman Abdullahi, said they purchased the firm for him because they believed in his capability.\n\nResponding, Sylva said he was honoured and humbled by the show of love, saying it shows commitment not to him, but to Nigeria.\n\nHowever, Lawan, who was formally presented with the expression of interest and nomination forms purchased for him by the group led by Nkire, said he had consulted widely and promised to play the game by the rules.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have listened to various calls from all parts of our dear country, our dear nation Nigeria, for me to show interest to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to commit myself to this call and to this movement of Nigerians from all walks of life, rich, poor, north, south, east, west, male, female, old and young.\n\n\u201cI am joining lately. The field is already full of other aspirants. I want, at this point, to assure Nigerians that the APC is a very beautiful bride and that is why we have many aspirants.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Adjourns to May 12\n\nAlex Enumah\n\n\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed of the Federal High Court Abuja, yesterday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) to appear before it on Thursday, over the participation of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr.Godwin Emefielein the 2023 presidential election.\n\nJustice Mohammed in addition ordered the CBN Governor to serve all court processes in relation to the suit he filed against INEC and the AGF who are 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.\n\nEmefiele had amongst others, approached the Federal High Court for an order restraining the defendants from preventing or hindering his participating in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\nAmongst the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise his desire to contest the presidential election.\n\nArguing the motion for maintenance of status quo, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, told the court that Emefiele \u201cis in a dilemma\u201d as to whether he can run in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nAccording to Ozekhome, time is of utmost importance, following the fact that timeline for collection of nomination and expression of interest forms ends on Wednesday May 11.\n\nOzekhome in addition told the court that the timeline for the primaries and congresses of political parties have been fixed for May 30 to June 1, and unless the court intervened there could be a carriage of great injustice against his client.\n\n\u201cHe needs the protection of the court, the court needs to ensure that nobody does anything that will hurt him,\u201d the senior lawyer submitted, adding that if the court refused to grant the order for maintenance of status quo restraining the defendants from hindering Emefiele from participating in the primary election under a political party of his choice within this period, the case would amount to a mere academic exercise by the time parties return to the court.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Mohammed made an order \u201cdirecting the defendants to appear before him on Thursday why the order of status quo ante bellum should not be made by the court\u201d.\n\nJustice Mohammed also directed the applicant to serve all court processes including the motion exparte and hearing notice for Thursday May 12 on the defendants.\n\nIn the main suit marked. FHC/ ABJ/ CS/610/2022, the plaintiff sought the interpretation of certain parts of the constitution that has to do with his aspiration of contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAmong the issues raised for determination are that whether any political party can validly rely on Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 to disqualify the plaintiff from participating in the congresses of any political party of his choice, \u201cwhere the plaintiff is protected by the provisions of Section 137(1)(G), 318 of the Constitution and Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWhether by Section 137 of the Constitution plaintiff can be compelled to resign earlier than 30 days his position of Governor of CBN to participate in the primary of any political party of his choice for the purpose of the 2023 February 25 presidential election.\u201d\n\nEmefiele is further asking the court to determine whether he is a political appointee, who is affected by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe said where the issues are determined in his favour, then the court should declare that; the defendants cannot validly rely on Section 84 (12) to disqualify the plaintiff from participating in the congresses of any political party of his choice where he is protected by Section 137 of the constitution.\n\nEmefiele also sought another declaration that by the provisions of Section 84 (3), a political party cannot by its constitution, guidelines or rules impose any nomination qualification or disqualification criteria or measures besides those prescribed under Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution.\n\nHe further urged the court to declare that by the combined effect of Section 84 (3) of the Electoral Act, 2022 and 137 of the constitution, the plaintiff cannot be compelled to resign earlier than 30 days to the presidential election in February 25, 2023.\n\nHe sought another declaration that he can validly participate in the congresses of any political party of his choice as well as vote and be voted for.\n\nIn the suit dated May 4, 2023, but filed on May 5, 2023, Emefiele prayed the court for an order that the defendants cannot hinder or stop him from participating in the congresses or presidential primary election of any political party of his choice.\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from hindering or stopping him from participating in the congresses or presidential primary election of any political party of his choice.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 which barred political appointees from participating in the convention and congresses of political parties unless they resigned 30 days to such conventions or congresses does not affect him being a public officer.\n\nHe explained that being a public officer whose status is defined by Section 318 of the constitution, he can only resign as CBN Governor 30 days to the presidential election in line with Section 137 of the Constitution.\n\nOzekhome, while urging the court to hold that the constitution is Supreme above any other laws including the Electoral Act and the constitution, guidelines and rules of political parties, added that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, had already been struck down for being inconsistent with the Constitution by Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court in Umuhia, Abia State.\n\nHe argued that although the judgment of Anyadike has been appealed against, it remains the law until it was set aside.\n\nIn the application of urgency in support of the suit, Emefiele submitted that it was within his right to contest the presidential election under any political party of his choice while still serving as Governor of the CBN, adding that all that was required of him was to give 30 days notice.\n\nHe, however, told the court that the defendants were \u201cmaking frantic efforts to disqualify him in the presidential primary election scheduled for May 30 to June 1 for not resigning before the primary.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor in addition said there was the urgent need for the court to hear the suit and, \u201cdetermine the rights of parties before the presidential election,\u201d adding that except this was done the plaintiff shall be wrongfully disqualified from participating in any of the primary of any political party of his choice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former Sokoto State Commissioner for Finance, Hon. Abdussamad Dasuki, has formally handed over the Ministry to the Permanent Secretary, Dahiru Balarabe Abbas.At the handover ceremony were the Accountant General, Umar B. Balarabe; Deputy Accountant General, Musa Mohammad Maccido; Director Debt Management, Murtala Umar Dogondaji; and Director Funds, Aliyu Abubakar Dange.\n\nDasuki who took over the affairs of the Ministry in 2019, had earlier tendered his resignation in March in compliance with the Electoral Act. He recently returned from a foreign trip to formally hand over to the permanent secretary.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, the former commissioner extolled Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal\u2019s sterling leadership, which has placed Sokoto in good stead for rapid growth and development.\n\nDasuki, who is the Santuraki of Sokoto, said with the prudent management of the resources of the state by the Tambuwal administration, the laudable reforms executed by the finance ministry and the various Legacy projects across the state, Sokoto was better positioned to compete favorably for investments and to meet the aspirations of its people.\n\nThe former commissioner said he feels fulfilled that he was handing over a reformed ministry that played a key role in the various reforms executed by the Tambuwal administration. He said with the reforms initiated and executed, the Finance Ministry was adequately prepared to continue to lead the way in the development agenda of the state government.\n\nHe recalled that at the inception of the Tambuwal administration, government finances were at the lowest ebb due to low FAAC Inflow, weak Internal Revenue Generation, abandoned and unpaid capital projects, and gratuity liabilities.\n\n\u201cIt was these and many others that the government had to grapple with at inception,\u201d he said, adding that the Ministry of Finance, whose sole responsibility is the management of public finance, disbursement, execution of financial policies and management of public debt and securities, was consequently saddled with the responsibility of reversing this ugly trend.\n\n\u201cFaced with these challenges, he said the Tambuwal administration came up with strategies to reform the public finance to ensure prudent management of resources, blocked loopholes in the state payroll and instituted a regime of transparency and accountability in public finance.\n\nDasuki said those reforms boosted the state\u2019s cash inflow and paved way for the provision of developmental projects across Sokoto.\n\nHe said the reforms of the state finances also received recognitions from major institutions, including a grant of $33m in three years and expecting another $22m before the end of 2022 from the World Bank for the commitment to the implementation of the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability (SFTAS) programme following its impressive score in the SFTAS ranking so far, placing it among the top three states in the country to achieve such ranking.\n\nSokoto also emerged first among the 36 states and FCT in the paying taxes column of the Subnational Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Baseline Survey as announced by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC).\n\nHe also listed the enactment of the harmonized Consolidated Revenue Law of 2019, which has helped the state to raise its IGR by 97 per cent.\n\nOther achievements of the ministry, according to Dasuki, include: continued automation of revenue processes; establishment of revenue codes for the state and all the 23 local governments; establishment of Single Treasury Account (TSA); Adoption of Cash Management Strategy; Adoption of Monthly Debt Arrears Clearance Framework on Contract and Gratuity payments; Establishment of SFTAS Secretariat; provision of utility vehicles, motor cycles, office furniture, ICT facilities and equipment; and construction of an ultramodern Revenue House and Complex.\n\nOthers include harmonizing state civil service database; sanitizing the state civil service salary and pension by linking BVN to personnel management data; provision of adequate manpower and ICT facilities for the salary department; training and retraining of staff for better output and performance; and implementations of N18,000 and subsequently N30,000 minimum wage and CONPCASS salary scale of tertiary institutions for civil servants, thus emerging as the only state in the Northwest that has been consistent with the payment of new minimum wage and with zero salary and pension arrears.\n\nDasuki also listed the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Agency Law 2020 and constitution of its board; migration from Cash Basis Accounts to IPSAS Cash and later Accrual Basis ISPAS; and monthly payment of subsistence allowance to both foreign and local students and also cleared arrears of tuition fees.\n\nThe former commissioner thanked Governor Tambuwal for the opportunity to serve at the helm of affairs of the finance ministry for three years, adding that he is confident that the achievements recorded by the ministry has placed Sokoto on the front row of states that has reformed their finance sector for optimal performance.\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am most glad because he is from the North-east, the only zone alongside South-east that is yet to produce president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained an unambiguous stand that for justice, equity and fairness in our country, the next president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari should come from the South-east or the North-east.\n\n\u201cI have also told Nigerians that I would only run for president if the two major political parties (APC and PDP) zone their tickets to the South-east.\n\n\u201cThat is why I was disappointed with our southern brothers who are talking about fairness and equity but has zero tolerance for the same fairness and equity in the South.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a South-easterner being president of Nigeria in 2023, I have my full support for a North-easterner. This is because it would be the closest to the equity, fairness and justice everyone is talking about.

          "text": "The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and airline operators have agreed to provide six million litres of aviation fuel at N480 a litre for three months.\n\nIt was part of the agreements reached at the end of the meeting summoned by the house of representatives on Monday to avert airline operators\u2019 planned shutdown.\n\nOn Friday, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) announced plans to shut down operations from Monday over the high cost of aviation fuel.\n\nThe group complained that aviation fuel, also known as Jet A1, has reached an all-time high of N700 per litre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFemi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house, announced the resolutions after about four hours of the meeting.\n\nGbajabiamila said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has agreed to provide the aviation fuel at N480 \u2014 in what seems like a forex subsidy \u2014 pending when the carriers would be granted license to import the commodity.\n\n\u201cIn the long term, you commence the process of applying for your own licence to be able to import your own jet fuel. So that it will remove, whether it is middlemen or frontmen or whatever. You will know the landing cost to assist you in your business,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is the benevolence of the CBN governor that six million litres available now at N480. You will get an allocation in the next three months through the companies (marketers) that you have nominated so that you would not come back and say jet fuel is now a certain amount and it is the fault of the NNPC. You have nominated those people that are selling to you.\u201d\n\nAs a long-term solution, the speaker said the airline operators must commence the process of securing a license for the importation of aviation fuel to avoid suspicion over the landing cost of the product and other associated logistic issues.\n\nWhile appreciating all the stakeholders for the efforts put in at resolving the issue at stake, he thanked the airline operators for being nationalistic in calling off the strike.\n\n\u201cI hope that the outcome of this meeting will usher in a lasting solution to these challenges of Jet A1 bearing in mind that there is a laissez-faire economy of demand and supply,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, Allen Onyema, vice-president of AON, said the scarcity can be addressed if airliners are allowed to purchase aviation fuel directly.\n\n\u201cWe were told here at that last meeting that fuel would be sold to us at N500 which we protested that it was still on the high side because even when fuel was selling at N200 or N250, the operating cost was about 40 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt rose to N400 and N450, and that was when we were alarmed, and you noticed that everybody tweaked his inventory when we now raised our base fare to about N50,000, which did not address the matter.\n\n\u201cWe were invited to the house, and when we came here, it was reached that they would give us fuel at N500 within three days. That never happened. We continued writing, and nothing happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMuch later, we were invited by the midstream and downstream authority and we were told that the president approved 25,000 metric tonnes for us as a palliative to help us. We were very grateful to the president. We were happy. We were told to nominate marketers that would market this product for us.\n\n\u201cWe were told to have a meeting with these marketers. We called all the marketers and held a meeting with them. We decided the logistics, so they would take their logistical costs and everything, and at the end of the day that fuel was getting to them, they told us at N335, so we put everything together, and it would be getting to less than N400 for the cost, and we said even if they sell to us at N450 it would be okay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were told that a week later that is when the consignment would be arriving in Nigeria and when this happened, the next we got to hear from the marketers was that they had already been given the consignment that we were all jostling for. So we waited thinking that they would sell as agreed. They never.\u201d\n\nOnyema said the matter was reported to Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, but no action was taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI called the MD of NNPC in the presence of our members. He replied, saying there was no way there would leave us to get direct products that was dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith due respect, Mr Speaker, we were not striking. We did not intend to go on a strike. It was not a strike. What AON was saying on Friday when we released our communique was that we do not have the money anymore to pay.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, Kyari said aviation fuel cannot have a fixed price because it is a deregulated product.\n\n\u201cSo you cannot hold unto any price and indeed what you have seen in the media is N700 reference point. It cannot be a reference point. It depends on the market condition. It can be higher than N700 depending on the market. This market shifts. As we speak, it is closely related to the price of crude oil,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is our role to ensure we intervene. We did. We brought in products so that we can dampen the price. In March and April, we brought in cargo and made it available to the entire industry at N460. There is a build-up to that price. When the customer takes marine at N435, he has to transport, he has to the charter vessel, bring it to his depot, to his fuel station and transport it. So there cannot be two same price in Lagos and Maiduguri.\n\nWe cannot fix the price. We cannot ask for N500. We cannot say it must be below N600 or N700.\n\nOn his part, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said the apex bank has no control over the flow of the dollar.\n\n\u201cWe do not have FX to sell. It would be difficult for us to grant any concession. It means we would be taking a hit or we would be providing some sort of subsidy for the industry,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya.

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Saze Ibraheem found satisfaction in marketing",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to really enjoy what I do for work, and want to have more of an impact on the people I work with.\u201d \u2014 Saze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective.\n\nIn November 2019, Jack Dorsey, Twitter ex-CEO and Square CEO, visited Lagos, Nigeria, on the first leg of his African tour. His activities peaked at a town hall at Techpoint Africa\u2019s headquarters. Saze Ibraheem, who moderated the panel session with three other Twitter executives, was consulting for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Parag Agrawal, (former Twitter CTO), Mike Montano (Engineering Team Lead), Jack Dorsey, (ex-CEO ), Kayvon Beykpour (Product Lead), and Saze Ibraheem (Moderator) all listening to Quoted Replies being pitched\n\nSaze (short for Osazemen) has spent more than a decade in marketing, focusing on technology, emerging media, and retail. When she isn\u2019t consulting for a business intentional about growth, Saze is creating and converting leads to happy customers or leading marketing strategies.\n\nInterestingly, Saze tried her hands on an extremely challenging project early in her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI like really big, bold, audacious ideas!\u201d\n\nIn what she considers her most significant achievement, ten years ago, she and her partner, Lade Ibraheem, organised TEDx Ikoyi, one of the first TEDx events in Nigeria. The event brought a diverse selection of thought leaders in the country together to speak on the theme, The Other Side of The Story, which was inspired by Chimamanda Adichie\u2019s TEDx talk with a similar title. This was instrumental in Saze receiving the Gates Foundation TEDxChange Scholarship and becoming a TEDx Ambassador for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe started TEDx Ikoyi because we felt like there\u2019s a lot more to Nigeria than existing negative stereotypical narratives. At that time, you\u2019d Google \u2018Nigeria\u2019, and the results you\u2019d see were like\u2026\u201d she scoffs, recollecting the results, and continues, \u201c\u2026 I mean, we have great thinkers, visionaries, and artists; we can take good pictures, what is going on here?\u201d she asks with a quizzical look as we sit for a chat at her home in Lagos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatting with Saze Ibraheem at her home in Lagos\n\nI can say that the event has played a part in shaping the Nigerian narrative. While writing this article, I stumbled on some beautiful pictures from the event on Behance, which a Nigerian photographer captured.\n\n\u201cThe event was really affirming. We worked with a number of partners and were able to deliver a tasteful and impactful event that we thought really showed multiple sides of our country. Nigeria is many things, and we felt it was important to show its plurality.\u201d\n\nTEDx Ikoyi was a massive undertaking for Saze; however, she has been part of arguably bigger things. She was part of Hilary Clinton\u2019s US State Department initiative, TechWomen, a professional exchange programme for women-in-tech in emerging regions. This enabled her to spend some time in Silicon Valley, where she built relationships with startups and a strong network of African women in tech.\n\nWhere it all started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so bullish on Lagos; it really has my heart. I love the mix of people here, the energy, the vibrancy.\u201d\n\nBorn in Lagos to parents from Edo State, Nigeria, Saze was fortunate to be exposed to books and computers from a very young age, thanks to encouraging parents and an excellent academic environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am eternally curious. I ask a lot of questions because I am genuinely interested, and I\u2019m excited to learn and understand even more. I think that my love for reading, knowing more, and researching has helped when I go into new sectors. I am exceptional at understanding user behaviour and how they want your product to solve their problem. That\u2019s my special sauce.\u201d\n\nSaze has an economics degree from the University of Manchester and an integrated marketing communications certificate from New York University. She had her eyes set on becoming an engineer but changed her mind in secondary school when her economics teacher, Mr Adewonyi, exposed her to the psychology of decision making within the constraints of demand and supply.\n\nShe recalls her creativity and penchant for business and how she could not figure out just what to do with them at the time.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, someone should have told me [that] marketing is how you use creativity to solve business problems, but no one did.\u201d\n\nShe adds how marketing as a course was unpopular at the time and that she found it hard to imagine it as a profession. Her creative spirit was as alive as her love for economics, and as an undergraduate, she gave \u2018artistic Saze\u2019 room for some expression.\n\n\u201cWhile at the university, I started a T-shirt line that I sold in Manchester and Lagos stores. I did my first fashion show and art exhibition right after graduating and always did things that brought commerce and creativity together to create community.\u201d\n\nSleeves up, fingers in the dirt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\nHer first industry experience was in the UK, with a short internship at the Ford Motor Company and a stint at a financial services firm where she learnt the basics of relationship management and customer service.\n\nBack in Nigeria, her year-long National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) experience after graduation took her to Abuja Technology Village. She calls this an exceptional experience that exposed her to the tangible potential of tech on a large scale in Nigeria.\n\nShe entered the world of marketing via operations at MultiChoice, where she was actively involved in market research in different cities and coordinating mobile payments; she also introduced moving customer service to social media. Saze appreciates the creative freedom her boss, Kapa Kaumba, gave her to execute her ideas.\n\nOne of her wins was doing the first online campaign to sell decoders which attracted massive sales.\n\n\u201cI found out that a lot of the ideas I was coming up with were marketing-related. Again, at that time, I just thought marketing was maybe, events; it wasn\u2019t very clear.\u201d\n\nBefore long, she got the clarity she needed from Donald Etim, the then Head of Marketing, and was convinced she was in the right space. Saze left for New York University to study integrated marketing communications and get more knowledge in the field.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible! It gave me [the] vocabulary for a lot of the ideas that I had. I had these hunches, but I didn\u2019t have ways to craft my hypotheses or articulate what I had to say. It gave me that confidence.\u201d\n\nAs a product manager and later marketing partnerships manager at online marketplace, Jumia, Saze was involved in sealing partnerships with businesses that have large audiences. If anything stood out for her, it was executing the rebrand from Kasuwa & Sabunta to Jumia in 2012.\n\nIn 2016, she joined Facebook as growth manager for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I was really proud of doing there was making a case to prolong support for feature phones as they were and continue to be ubiquitous in emerging markets. At the time, we also launched Facebook in Hausa, which really increased accessibility in the region.\u201d\n\nIn between, she also founded 4Twenty3 with an initial plan to carve a niche in digital marketing.\n\nMentioning some of the brands the agency has served, Saze says, \u201cWe worked with Jade Osiberu and her team to build out Ndani TV, the digital content marketing platform at GTBank, to create programming, asking questions like \u2018What should GTB look and sound like if it was a tv show?\u2019\u201d\n\nClassifieds marketplace, OLX (acquired by Jiji); Techpoint Africa; and Alara Lagos, a luxury retailer, are also on the list.\n\nUp the ladder and still going\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\nSaze usually prefers to help businesses turbo-charge their ideas, but she hasn\u2019t always been a fan of entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I was an accidental entrepreneur. I became one because nobody was doing what I wanted to do. People didn\u2019t really understand digital marketing at the time, so like Nike, I just did it! I\u2019m an extrovert; I like people, I like being in a team, I like brainstorming, and I like community. That\u2019s where I thrive, and I\u2019m very happy to be able to do that now.\u201d\n\nAmidst the global pandemic in July 2020, Saze joined ART X Collective, producers of the annual ART X Lagos fair, to spearhead its marketing efforts. Here, Saze got her \u201c360 moment\u201d because she put her cumulative experience in business, culture, and digital marketing to play.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we delivered was our first online-only fair. So, being able to bring all of those different skills and expertise to something I\u2019m very passionate about, which is amplifying and supporting creatives on the continent, was really fulfilling.\u201d\n\nAs head of marketing, she manages online and offline campaigns, business development for sponsorships and consulting, and local and international PR, among others. Her workdays involve stakeholder engagement, developing strategy, and team building.\n\nOne of her strengths is her ability to manage a team in a way that\u2019s authentic to her. As a leader who doesn\u2019t enjoy micromanagement, she loves to identify exceptional people and provide conducive environments for them to thrive and shine.\n\nTo keep up with the constantly moving parts, Saze uses good old-fashioned sticky notes. She listens to audiobooks and podcasts for productivity and has a vast library of physical books. For work, she uses Google\u2019s suite of tools and Asana.\n\nFamily and friends are important to her, and for work-life balance, WhatsApp and Calm apps come in handy. And to relax, she watches sci-fi movies, takes luxurious holiday breaks, gets massages, eats, and travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaverse and EMURGO held an exclusive hangout with founders and stakeholders in the blockchain space on Thursday, May 5, 2022, in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nEMURGO is the official commercial arm governing investment operations of the Cardano blockchain, which is regarded as one of the top platforms for building tech solutions in the blockchain space.\n\nThe event created an atmosphere for networking and sharing ideas between the organisers and the attendees.\n\nShogo Ishida and Yosuke Yoshida (co-CEOs of EMURGO Africa and the Middle East) were the representatives of EMURGO present at the hangout.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Chimezie Chuta, Founder and coordinator of Blockchain Nigeria Users group and Partner at Adaverse, discussed some of the advantages of building on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBlockchain technology is one of the most lucrative opportunities available for entrepreneurs and people in tech to build solutions and be rewarded for doing so both from the market and the industry itself.\u201d\n\nHe also highlighted how lack of regulation could be both good and bad in the blockchain space. Discussing the good, he said that the absence of regulation in the blockchain space gives people the opportunities to experiment. Also, you don\u2019t need to be in a specific place to build and launch your product.\n\nChimezie added that there are tons of African-specific problems requiring blockchain-specific solutions. Also, the lack of legacy systems is an advantage for blockchain startups, giving them opportunities to build new solutions.\n\nChimezie then reiterated the importance of branding to new founders in the blockchain space. He advised founders to look at brand strategy and messaging as a relationship. He added that businesses should look at their brand strategy as a relationship between them and their customers.\n\nChimezie discussed how Adaverse plans to help blockchain-focused startups. He said Adaverse could help in terms of tokenisation design, articulate how the token economy of the project should look like, technical consultation, skills and talents acquisition, marketing, financial support, and mentorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past three months, Adaverse has made some investments, and they are looking forward to kickstarting their accelerator program soon.\n\nStartups can get up to $500,000 if Adaverse finds what they are building to be interesting enough. Also, if the project valuation ranges from 2 to 30 million dollars, it increases the chances of being accepted into the program. Adaverse has already invested in about seven startups, which include Canza, Cassava, and Afriguild, among others. ,\n\nAdaverse investment interests cut across solutions building on the emerging Web3. Some of the portfolio companies already funded are focused on cross border payments, Web3, DeFi, talent protocol, NFTs, gaming and p2p systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next speaker, Yosuke Yoshida, Ex-CEO of EMURGO Japan and co-CEO for the Middle East, highlighted that Cardano is a third-generation blockchain built to improve previous generations, which are Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardano is unique because they look to solve the scalability problem present in the blockchain space. The settlement layer and the combination layer are the layers present in the Cardano blockchain.\n\nSecondly, interoperability is another important solution that Cardano aims to provide in the blockchain space. They look at connecting with legacy companies such as banks.\n\nFinally, sustainability. The Cardano blockchain is in the third stage of development out of five, and they plan to open the development and contribution to the community after the fifth stage is complete.\n\nYosuke said that more improvement is being made on the blockchain, and they constantly go through peer review, which means that they spend a lot of time in research. They collaborate with people in academia and implement after considerable research has been done.\n\nHe then mentioned that they have been collaborating with different projects in the blockchain, and Adaverse, who organised and hosted the hangout, was one of them.\n\nThe goal of the collaborations is to increase the Cardano blockchain usage and encourage founders to build solutions that will be hosted on the blockchain.\n\nEMURGO has many arms, which are not limited to EMURGO ventures, EMURGO Africa, including standard technology tools available on the platform, such as the Yoroi wallet, which is the main wallet of the Cardano blockchain. EMURGO, in partnership with Adaverse, has a venture capital wheel where they plan to invest in blockchain centred startups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMURGO has invested in a host of startups that offer web3-based solutions, one of which is API3, and they plan to do more.\n\nShogo Ishida, Executive Director, EMURGO for the Middle East and Africa, talked about investments, requirements and what they expect founders to have when applying for funding.\n\nHe highlighted some points, which include having a team. Founders should try not to build alone.\n\n\u2018A team is very important. However, If you have a team, are they good enough?\u201d\n\nShogo further said that they are responsible for all the EMURGO syndicates, and they have built a 100 million dollar investment wheel.\n\nTherefore, they want to know what the founders have been building, and they want to know how they can help.\n\nSpeaking on why there is a focus on Africa, Shogo said there is an identification (ID) issue, especially in developing countries. The lack of ID cuts people off many benefits, which is why they partnered with the Ethiopian government and built schools. They look at creating and providing digital IDs and increasing access to financial services.\n\nIn their bid to enter the African space, they have invested and partnered with Adaverse and Adanian labs.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Shogo said founders have to be passionate about their projects. Giving a hint on what they expect from founders, Shogo said that giving a general overview of the project or demography is not enough. Founders should do in-depth research and make them understand what and who the target market is.\n\nIn summary, they at EMURGO will look at the team, research, product and the traction or engagement it gets. Founders and developers are encouraged to build their solutions on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nFounders in need of funding are encouraged to send their pitch deck to apply at https://www.adaverse.co/ and may send a follow-up mail to chuta@adaverse.co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nSometimes \u2014 unintentionally \u2014 I can\u2019t cover all that happens in the tech ecosystem during the week. And that\u2019s one reason we have the Techpoint Africa Podcast.\n\nToday, one of the podcast highlights was Elon Musk\u2019s plan for Twitter. While Bolu discussed the plan, one glaring question the editorial team and I had was: Are Africans a part of this new Twitter? I mean, are you even part of Musk\u2019s equation?\n\nTo get a clear picture of what I\u2019m talking about, please listen to it here. Remember to share with your family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nInstagram\u2019s plan to start testing NFTs\n\nPaymob\u2019s $50 million Series B\n\nFacebook phasing out some of its features\n\nManara\u2019s $3 million pre-seed\n\nInstagram to start testing NFTs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Monday, May 9, 2022, Instagram CEO, Adam Mosseri, announced that the platform would begin testing NFTs with select creators this week in the United States.\n\nHe also said that there would be no fees for posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram.\n\nPresently, the supported blockchains for showcasing NFTs on Instagram are Ethereum and Polygon, with support for Flow and Solana coming soon. Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and MetaMask are among the third-party wallets that will be supported.\n\nCreators and participants in the test can now share NFTs that they have created or purchased. These NFTs can be shared in your main Feed, Stories, or messages.\n\nMosseri explained that only a small number of people have access to the test, but the company intends to roll out more NFT-related functionality in the future based on feedback from its initial testing.\n\nWeb3 \u2019bout to take over: Recall that in April 2022, Telegram\u2019s Telegram Open Network (TON) Foundation announced the availability of crypto payment capabilities.\n\nThis means that users can download Telegram\u2019s official wallet bot, which allows them to buy, trade, and send cryptocurrencies to other wallets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keep in mind that on January 2022, Twitter Blue added another feature for its users: the ability to connect a crypto wallet and upload an NFT as a profile picture for mobile iOS users, which it added to accommodate high user demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, stated that similar functionality would be added to Facebook soon and possibly to other Meta apps in the future. He also claimed that Meta will be working on augmented reality NFTs, or 3D NFTs, that can be added to Instagram Stories using Spark AR, the company\u2019s software AR platform.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nPaymob\u2019s $50 million Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaymob, an Egyptian fintech that allows merchants to accept digital payments online and in-store, has raised $50 million in Series B.\n\nPayPal Ventures, Kora Capital, and Clay Point led the round. Also, British International Investment (formerly the CDC Group), Nclude, and three unnamed Egyptian banks participated.\n\nThe fintech company was founded by Islam Shawky, Alain El Hajj, and Mostafa Menessy. It collaborates with a diverse range of businesses and merchants. Its omnichannel payment infrastructure \u2014 which Islam claims is the largest in Egypt \u2014 allows them to accept payments in various ways.\n\nThese options include mobile wallets, QR payments, bank card installments, BNPL, and consumer finance payment options. Paymob also offers a PoS solution for offline merchants, allowing them to accept in-store card payments.\n\nPaymob claims to serve merchants in other markets, including Kenya and Palestine but has yet to open a branch in these countries. Instead, the company\u2019s sights are set on a few Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \u2014 political and economic alliances of six Middle Eastern countries \u2014 and North African markets.\n\nBesides, the funds will also increase its market share in Egypt and add new offerings to its product suite, like expense management software and working capital provision.\n\nFacebook is phasing out some features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nSocial media consultant, Matt Navarra, announced that Facebook, the social media giant, will phase out Nearby Friends \u2014 a feature that finds out if any of your friends are nearby so you can hang out \u2014 on May 31, 2022.\n\nAlso, weather alerts, location history, and background location will be phased out the same day.\n\nSupposedly, these features will no longer collect information after that date, and the previously shared location history and background location information will be deleted by August 1, 2022.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Facebook says it will continue to collect users\u2019 location data for other experiences to personalise and improve its products and recommend ads to you.\n\nIs this similar? Aside from social networking apps, Apple and Google both provide tools for finding friends and family, as do dedicated family tracking services like Life360.\n\nManara\u2019s $3 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManara, an edtech startup, has raised $3 million in pre-seed for its cohort-based training platform to grow the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region\u2019s tech talent pool.\n\nStripe led the startup\u2019s pre-seed round, while LinkedIn Founder, Reid Hoffman; Y Combinator founder, Paul Graham; Lean Startup founder, Eric Ries; and Careem founder, Mudassir Sheikha participated.\n\nWhat does it do? Launched by Iliana Montauk (CEO) and Laila Abudahi (CTO) in 2020, the startup bills itself as a social impact edtech startup that provides computer science training to anyone who qualifies.\n\nWhile there is no tuition fee, students must contribute 10% of their salary to Manara during their first two years of employment. Also, the company claims that its alumni have been placed at large tech companies like Meta and Google in Europe and the United States.\n\nAccording to Manara, 86% of its trained engineers receive job offers within five months of graduating, and others receive up to a 300% pay increase after the training.\n\nThe startup intends to use the funds to increase its annual training capacity from 60 to 6,000 engineers. They also plan to launch a self-service product for interview practice, networking, and mentoring, aimed at software engineers worldwide.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nAFS Global STEM Accelerators is looking for females between the ages of 15 and 17 years to apply for its 12 week all-virtual programs focusing on emerging and critical STEM skills and fields, global competence education, and social impact (co-developed with the University of Pennsylvania).

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade, commerce, and the entire system of value exchange are no longer confined to the geographical boundaries of one country. These days, businesses strive to reach a global audience, leveraging the power of technology to achieve results. However, despite the efforts of businesses (both small and large scale) to tap into the potential of borderless transactions, they have continually faced a series of challenges, prominent among them are the exorbitant charges of traditional banks and fintechs, and the unfavourable fluctuation in value of national currencies. This is especially true for businesses in emerging markets across Africa, Asia, South America, and the rest of the world. This is without considering the periodic shifts and changes to governmental regulations in these countries.\n\nAs a way out, IvoryPay aims to help businesses, merchants, and creators maximise gains by providing them with an alternative route to making and receiving payments. Built on the Solana blockchain, IvoryPay\u2019s aim is to help online businesses facilitate bankless transactions through cryptocurrency. With IvoryPay, businesses in emerging markets will be able to reduce the cost of transacting, increase transaction processing and payment confirmation speed, and accept payments in stable currencies.\n\nThe IvoryPay ecosystem comprises three components which include the Ivorypay payment gateway solution, the NFT Storefront, and the IVRY token. The payment gateway infrastructure helps online businesses easily accept payment in stablecoins and the IVRY token, offering customers the option to make payments using the most convenient means. Businesses on IvoryPay can accept payments using QR codes, checkout integrations, payment links, and buttons. The NFT Storefront will provide digital creators and businesses the opportunity to better monetize and diversify their revenue stream. Creators can choose from pre-existing templates to easily set up their storefront and be operational in no time, with an integrated payment system that allows them to sell the NFTs seamlessly. The IVRY token, which is the native cryptocurrency of the project will be used as a means of exchange between customers and merchants and it will also be used for staking purposes.\n\nThe idea to create an alternative means of payment facilitation that birthed IvoryPay was conceived by Oluwatobi Ajayi and Ope Akinremi, who are also Co founders of Uptrend Africa, one the biggest crypto marketing agencies in Africa championing grassroot cryptocurrency adoption. Oluwatobi who has worked in the crypto/alternative payment space over the past couple of years is of the belief that \u201cglobal businesses have reached a point where the barriers to trade should be non-existent and payment solutions should present businesses with multiple options with the end goal of simplifying payment processes and enhancing user experience without the need to break a sweat or empty your pocket in the process\u201d.\n\nOpe further added that \u201cconsumers are the backbone of the global economy and it is the foremost responsibility of all forward-thinking businesses to be in tune with the demands of their consumers. Thinking forward, in this case, would imply offering users the means to make payment in the manner they find most convenient, and trendy\u201d.\n\nWith the project in its development phase, it is only a matter of time before Ivorypay launches its robust payment architecture. The project could be a game-changer for online businesses in emerging markets and global commerce as a whole.\n\nFor more information, you can visit www.ivorypay.io.

          "text": "Five things to know to start your Tuesday\n\nMarket gains over N520bn amid bullish start to new week\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) All-Share Index (ASI) and market capitalisation increased remarkably by 1.90 percent or N521billion on Monday May 9, from week-open lows of 50,935.03 points and N27.460 trillion respectively to 51,903.44 points and N27.981trillion.\n\nThe bullish start to stocks trading in this new week pushed this year\u2019s record positive return to new high of 21.51percent. In 7,684 deals, investors exchanged 337,564,205 units valued at N5.554billion.\n\nNigerian Breweries Plc led the gainers after its share price moved from N70 to N77, adding N7 or 10percent, followed by Cadbury Plc which rose from N13.55 to N14.90, up N1.35 or 9.96percent and International Breweries Plc which rose from N6.75 to N7.40, adding 65kobo or 9.63percent.\n\n\u201cOur view is that the odds are more for a possibility of gains. Hence, we expect the market to close positive this week,\u201d according to Lagos-based analysts at Meristem.\n\nThe analysts had in their May 9 note to investors said that they view the hike in rates in the United States and United Kingdom as global macroeconomic dynamics that might filter into the local market.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, opportunities for capital repatriation on large-cap stocks that have dual listing (Airtel Africa and Seplat) could drive buying activities. Some stocks still present decent upsides to spur buying interest.\n\n\u201cWe however note that foreign participation in the Nigerian equities market is not as strong (circa 20percent). There is also some room for profit taking on some tickers on some tickers that have gained appreciably in recent weeks,\u201d Meristem analysts added.\n\nNigeria, other emerging-market debt at \u2018mercy\u2019 of Fed rate hike says JPMorgan\n\nNigeria and other emerging market sovereign debt are at the \u201cmercy\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike of over 50 basis points, says JPMorgan on Monday. This is according to Reuters.\n\nThe investment banking giant downgraded Nigeria\u2019s status as it believes that the country failed to take advantage of the high oil prices. However, the bank recommended that investors consider putting Serbia and Uzbekistan\u2019s sovereign debt in the \u201coverweight\u201d category.\n\nAfter more than a decade of stability, the Fed, reacting to rising global inflation, especially that of the US hitting a 30-year high, decided to raise the interest rate by 50 basis points. with an attendant effect on driving benefits for higher-yielding emerging markets.\n\nReuters reported that \u201cJPMorgan\u2019s Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified (EMBIGD) index has fallen 16 percent this year,\u201d \u201cwith most of the losses having come from rates\u201d and $4 billion in net outflows from emerging markets since mid-April.\u201d\n\nThe lender believes that so many external shocks have made it difficult for many emerging economies\u2019 sovereign debt bonds to remain attractive, especially when taking a look at the impact the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown in China is having on emerging markets.\n\nThey observed that with coupon yields at nearly 10.6 percent, the highest they have ever been since the outbreak of COVID-19, the risk of default in payment is very high.\n\nJPMorgan associated Nigeria\u2019s likely default situation to some domestic fundamental issues following reports that the NNPC failed to transfer any revenue to the government from January to March this year, due primarily to fuel subsidies and low production. The low production is a result of the leakages caused by crude oil theft, which is commonplace in the Niger Delta region of the country. A situation that forced the company to remove the country\u2019s debt status from the \u201coverweight\u201d category.\n\nEskom top executive quits amid epileptic power supply in South Africa\n\nAmid growing concern over the epileptic electricity situation in South Africa, a senior executive at Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., has resigned his appointment at the struggling electricity company.\n\nEskom said in a statement made available on its website that Phillip Dukashe, the group executive in charge of generation who always provides regular updates about the electricity situation via an online briefing, will be leaving the company on May 31, after 26 years of active service.\n\nThe company said without providing many details that his resignation is to enable him to achieve a balance for \u201cthe benefit of his health, family, and work responsibilities.\u201d Rhulani Mathebula will take over on an interim basis during the recruitment process.\n\nEskom, which generates nearly 95 percent of the electricity in the country, has been struggling for some time to complete turnaround maintenance. The company has been under pressure to fix the engine of Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation for years.\n\nThe company announced nationwide power cuts on Monday.\n\nRead also: Fashion takes centre stage as AMVCA kicks off\n\nChina\u2019s sinosteel signs $690 million deal for Cameroon iron mine\n\nAs a part of China\u2019s strategic economic plan, China\u2019s Sinosteel Corp. has entered into a $690 million deal to exploit iron ore in southern Cameroon. A move the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sees as reducing its dependence on Australian and Brazilian ore.\n\nZheng Zhengao, the company\u2019s Head of Operation in Cameroon, stated that the Lobe mine will produce 10 million tonnes of ore containing 33 percent iron per year. \u201cIt will then enrich the output to produce 4 million tonnes of high-grade ore with more than 60 percent iron content,\u201d he added.\n\nA report from Bloomberg states that the Chinese company entered into a 50-year contract with the government of Cameroon to exploit the Lobe deposit, which contains an estimated 632.8 million tons of iron ore.\n\nUK retail sales hit by rising cost of living says BRC\n\nThe rising cost of living has so badly affected consumers\u2019 confidence that it has slowed consumer spending in the United Kingdom, says the British Retail Consortium (BRC). The agency, which is a trade association for retail businesses in the UK, said that consumer spending fell 1.7 percent on a like-for-like basis in April 2022 from a year earlier, slowing further from 0.4 percent in the previous month.\n\nBRC CEO Helen Dickinson said in a forum that \u201cbig-ticket items have been hit hardest, as consumers reigned in spending on furniture, electricals and other homeware, compounded by delays on goods coming from China.\u201d\n\nHelen believes that with inflation expected to exceed 10%, retailers are concerned that rising commodity prices, transportation costs, labour shortages, and the conflict in Ukraine, among other factors, will make it difficult for customers to maintain their current spending habits.",

          "text": "The recently released revised regulation on retirement and terminal benefits by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) for contributors and retirees has strengthened the responsibility of Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) towards their clients, as well as enhanced protection for Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders.\n\nSome experts had stressed the need for improved services after the PFAs\u2019 recapitalisation that ended penultimate week.\n\nPaddy Ezeala, managing director/CEO, Development Agenda, said while recapitalisation in the pension industry is a welcome development to the extent that it is expected to lead to stronger PFAs, with improved capacity for more efficient service delivery, it should benefit the RSA holders.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there should be a bridge between growth in Assets under Management and the economic well-being of the generality of RSA holders and retirees under the CPS. It does not augur well when regulators are doing a fantastic job and shareholders in PFAs are smiling to the bank while retirees are gnashing their teeth,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, all the externalities that impinge on the all-round success of the CPS must also be addressed: low minimum wage, high inflation rate, low return on investment (RoI) of pension assets and general economic downturn.\n\n\u201cAbove all, a much higher percentage of the RoI in pension assets must be for RSA holders,\u201d Ezeala said.\n\nThe following are the issues that have been addressed in the revised regulation:\n\nDocumentation process\n\nWhile the old regulation outlined the documents required for retirees to access benefits, the revised regulation has simplified the documentation process. It has now mandated PFAs to make efforts to ensure that all documentation preparatory to the retirement of the RSA holder should be provided and concluded within a period of four months prior to the date of retirement.\n\nIn order to ensure that prospective retirees are duly educated on the modes of accessing their benefits, PFAs have also been mandated to advise prospective retirees to check their websites and be acquainted with the CPS Retirement Pack containing features of Programmed Withdrawal and Retiree Life Annuity at least three months to date of retirement. The pack also contains other salient issues that would guide the retirees towards a smooth retirement process.\n\nNon-confirmation of employment status by employers\n\nIn addition, the revised regulation has simplified the provisions on the notification and documentation required for access to RSA due to temporary loss of job. Temporary loss of job has been defined as a situation \u201cwhere an employee voluntarily retires, disengages or is disengaged before attaining the age of 50 years and is unable to secure another employment after four months of the disengagement.\u201d\n\nThe provision addresses situations where employers refuse to confirm the retirement or disengagement of their former employees. Prior to this revision, a letter of acceptance of resignation or disengagement issued by the employer is mandatory for a pension contributor seeking payment of 25 percent for temporary loss of job. However, the revised regulation provides that where the employer fails/refuses to accept the resignation letter from the employee.\n\nThe PFA shall write the employer confirming the employee\u2019s resignation and ensure that an acknowledgement copy is kept as proof of receipt. Where the employer fails to respond to the PFA\u2019s inquiry within 30 days, the employer\u2019s refusal is taken as acceptance of the employee\u2019s resignation for the purpose of benefits payment.\n\nAdditional lump sum payment\n\nSignificantly, in terms of lump sum payment, the revised regulation has clarified that the retirees shall be allowed to access additional lump sum after the payment of initial lump sum provided that there are additional inflows of funds into the RSA from the employers. However, the additional remittances shall first be applied to augment pension up to 50 percent of the retiree\u2019s final salary while the balance may be paid out as lump sum. Where the retiree\u2019s pension is already up to 50 percent of final salary, the retiree may choose to collect the entire additional remittances as a lump sum. Where the additional inflow into the RSA of a retiree-on-Retiree Life Annuity is not up to N100, 000 the amount shall be paid directly into the retiree\u2019s bank account, subject to the Commission\u2019s approval.\n\nRead also: Pension sector set for transformation on new capital\n\nRSA consolidation before payment of benefits\n\nThe revised regulation has also clarified that the RSA must be consolidated before retirement benefits can be accessed. A retiree shall only be entitled to access his or her retirement benefits upon consolidation of his or her RSA. The components of an RSA at retirement shall consist of accrued pension rights or pre-act benefits (if any) for employees that were in employment before the commencement of the CPS, employer/employee pension contributions, returns on investment and fixed portion of voluntary contributions (if any). The new regulation mandates the PFA to take necessary steps to liaise with the employer and other relevant parties, to ensure that all the entitlements of a retiree or deceased person is credited to his/her RSA for the purpose of determining the final RSA balance, before processing of benefits.\n\nAccrued pension benefits for private sector contributors\n\nFurthermore, the revised regulation has made provision for the administration of Pre-Act Benefits, which are the accrued pension benefits of contributors mainly in the private sector in line with the employer\u2019s trust deed prior to the commencement of the CPS in June 2004. Any employee who retires and has Pre-Act contributions shall notify the PFA of his/her intention to withdraw the Pre-Act balance. A PFA shall request the retiree to provide necessary documents and an application to access the Pre-Act part of the RSA balance. Consequently, the Pre-Act balance can be paid to the retiree separately, prior to selecting either Programmed Withdrawal or Annuity modes of accessing retirement benefits.",

          "title": "WHO prequalification: A leading strategy for strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing in Africa",
          "text": "Access to affordable, safe, and quality medicines is a key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. However, substandard and falsified (SF) medicines have remained a global scourge and concern for the health community worldwide.\n\nTo address these challenges of substandard and falsified drugs and to ensure that pharmaceutical products used for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of priority diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are safe, appropriate and meet stringent quality standards, the WHO established the Prequalification of Medicines programme in 2001. The WHO prequalification (PQ) aims to provide qualified, safe and efficacious medicines for United Nations\u2019 (UN) procurement agencies and to countries for bulk purchasing and distribution of medicines in resource-limited countries.\n\nTo address the issues of high upfront cost, it is essential that African governments see the critical need for investment in the WHO PQ of pharmaceutical companies as a non-negotiable pathway to strengthening the pharmaceutical sector\n\nTill date, over 680 medicines have been qualified across the globe. Unfortunately, Africa lags behind as only South Africa, Morocco and Uganda have prequalified pharmaceutical manufacturing companies with the right to take part in international tenders for medicines and sell their pharmaceutical products to other countries across the globe. As we enter the post-covid-19 era, it is even more crucial to rethink pharmaceutical supply chain and re-emphasize the need to have quality manufacturing in areas where the disease burden is high. Africa needs to have many companies with WHO prequalified products.\n\nBenefits of WHO prequalification for pharmaceutical manufacturing companies\n\nThe attainment of WHO PQ by pharmaceutical manufacturers in Africa holds several benefits for the companies, individual countries, and Africa as a whole. WHO PQ is based on assessment of a product dossier submitted by the pharmaceutical manufacturing company seeking prequalification of their medical products, using internationally accepted regulatory standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and inspection of the corresponding manufacturing sites to ensure conformity with WHO Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers that attain WHO PQ of their product establish their capability to produce medicines that consistently meet stringent standards of quality in line with WHO specifications and global standards. This provides opportunities for increased sales and market access by conferring eligibility for international, donor-sponsored tenders for medicines; improved capacity to manufacture products for entry into stringently regulated markets; increased potential to compete successfully for contract manufacture for local markets; and faster registration.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that UN agencies and other donors and agencies require WHO PQ for bulk purchasing of medicines. This shows that the WHO prequalified status offers a significant advantage.\n\nAt the national and continental level, WHO PQ means an increased availability of quality-assured medicines and the building of national capacity for sustainable local manufacturing and monitoring of quality medicines, as well as the positioning of Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical sector as a global competitor.\n\nBarriers to achieving WHO prequalification in Africa\n\nA major barrier to achieving WHO PQ in Africa is the high upfront cost. Pharmaceutical companies would need to invest several millions of dollars to upgrade their factories and to hire or train qualified professional and technical personnel in order to meet WHO PQ requirements. Without the support from government or donor agencies, most pharmaceutical companies lack the capacity for such enormous capital investment.\n\nAnother significant barrier is the poor technical support and limited expertise about achieving WHO PQ. Most pharmaceutical companies have limited information on the specific requirements for WHO PQ and the application process. Attaining WHO PQ is a highly technical process, requiring comprehensive technical and professional support from experts in the field. Another barrier is weak regulatory systems.\n\nPotential strategies to overcome barriers\n\nTo address the issues of high upfront cost, it is essential that African governments see the critical need for investment in the WHO PQ of pharmaceutical companies as a non-negotiable pathway to strengthening the pharmaceutical sector. Investment from government and foreign donors is needed to reduce the financial burden of WHO PQ on pharmaceutical companies. Government support through incentives related to taxes and other waivers will be beneficial. Above all, a guaranteed procurement plan will be an excellent incentive for such investment. This model was a great motivation for achieving WHO PQ in Uganda and should be replicated.\n\nExploring Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) is a strategy to address issues of lack of technical know-how. A good example is the strategic partnership between Nigeria\u2019s National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) and its technical partner, Bloom Public Health. In a World Bank-funded program, NIPRD and Bloom Public Health will commence support of selected Nigerian pharmaceutical manufacturers through the process of WHO PQ. This will be the biggest pharmaceutical intervention in the country and will be a great model for other African countries.\n\nBloom Public Health will provide full technical support for the selected companies, including accessing gaps in the companies\u2019 technical capacities and quality management systems when compared with global standards; conducting technical workshops on the process of WHO PQ; etc. This project will achieve the first ever WHO PQ of pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria.\n\nConclusion\n\nWHO PQ is critical to strengthening Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical sector. Government support, as well as incentives, and developing mechanisms for strategic partnerships are essential to achieving WHO PQ of pharmaceutical companies and sustainable availability of quality, efficient, and safe medicines in Africa.",
          "summary": "Unfortunately, Africa lags behind as only South Africa, Morocco and Uganda have prequalified pharmaceutical manufacturing companies with the right to take part in international tenders for medicines and sell their pharmaceutical products to other countries across the globe.\nBenefits of WHO prequalification for pharmaceutical manufacturing companiesThe attainment of WHO PQ by pharmaceutical manufacturers in Africa holds several benefits for the companies, individual countries, and Africa as a whole.\nBarriers to achieving WHO prequalification in AfricaA major barrier to achieving WHO PQ in Africa is the high upfront cost.\nInvestment from government and foreign donors is needed to reduce the financial burden of WHO PQ on pharmaceutical companies.\nThis project will achieve the first ever WHO PQ of pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria.",

As of now no party has selected its presidential candidate. What is utmost in the mind of every political party is to win election. No party will throw the opportunity away. The South-East needs the presidency but we can\u2019t do it alone. We need the support of other zones,\u201d he said when asked his take on the clamour for zoning of the presidency to the Southeast in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the two political parties, the PDP, and All Peoples Party/Alliance for Democracy APP/AD through internal mechanism chose their candidates from the South-West so that head or tail the winner of the presidential election would come from the South-West. It was done to assuage the zone.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 situation is repeating itself and many Nigerians are in support of the presidency going to the South-East.

I hope in two weeks time, those responsible will be revealed to Nigerians. The security agencies asked for more time to do their investigation,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged disunity among five governors of the Southeast, Uzodimma said: \u201cThe situation in the South-East is not different from other zones. We are working. We are united and working together to ensure security. Security issues are not discussed in the open. It is not true that we are not talking to ourselves.\u201d\n\nOn last week\u2019s Supreme Court judgement, which gave 17 disputed oil wells to Rivers State, Governor Uzodimma said he was yet to get the details of the judgement.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen details of the judgement. It is too early to celebrate. I want to wait till I see the details. Some of the oil wells are in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State. Does it mean Oguta is now in Rivers State?

NJF would also take copious and profuse interests in the role of political or corporate leaders particularly from Nsukka in the propagation of this injustice against Isi Uzo people.

          "text": "Twenty-four hours to the May 10 deadline on the sale of All Progressives Congress\u2019 (APC) nomination forms, the number of presidential hopefuls from the party has increased by two with former President Goodluck Jonathan, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and former Bayelsa state Governor Timipre Sylva joining the race.\n\nThe trio picked the Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms Monday in Abuja through different individuals and groups and later presented to their principals.\n\nWith Lawan\u2019s entrance into the race, a larger picture of the north in the contest has emerged, as the lawmaker becomes the third aspirant from the zone.\n\nJigawa state Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and former Zamfara state Governor Ahmed Sani Yermia had last week, also picked the forms, thus boosting the chance for a northern candidacy and setting the stage for the north versus south scenario at the primaries.\n\nJonathan joins, group justifies action\n\nPicking the N100 million forms for Jonathan, the Fulani Nomadic Pastoralists and Almajiri Communities of Nigeria (FNPACN) said they gave their support to the former president because he developed the Fulani pastoralists and Almajirai.\n\nSporting fez caps with the inscription \u2018run Jonathan run\u2019, members of the groups said Jonathan remains the most qualified to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe incumbent President Buhari defeated Jonathan in the 2015 presidential elections in a landslide victory.\n\nJonathan was first elected in 2011 after completing the tenure of his former boss, late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nThere had been speculations that the former president was set to switch from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling party to contest for the nation\u2019s top office in 2023.\n\nBut, Jonathan had told a crowd of supporters to \u201cwatch out\u201d.\n\n\u201cYes, you are calling me to come and declare for the 2023 presidency, yes I can\u2019t tell I am declaring; the political process is ongoing, just watch out,\u201d he had said.\n\nAddressing journalists after picking the nomination forms Monday, the group, led by Mallam Ibrahim Abdullahi, boasted they had 14 million voters to support former president.\n\nWhen asked whether Jonathan has joined the APC, Abdullahi said: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe said they were offering him the support because of the \u201ccomprehensive policy of the Goodluck Jonathan administration of reformation and integration of the Almajarai into the educational system of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt was the dream and the vision of President Jonathan to produce doctors, lawyers and Engineers from Almajarai, but unfortunately that laudable vision was abandoned once he left office.\n\n\u201cAnother group that he tried to develop was the Fulani Pastoralists. I believe if this government had continued with his vision, Nigeria would have become the Denmark, the Holland of the entire Africa, in terms of livestock production, in terms of milk, beef and so on.\n\n\u201cLooking at this situation, the problems Nigeria today is facing, we need a leader with that kind of patriotism, a leader with that kind of fairness, a leader who can give all Nigerians a sense of belonging is who we need. That person is Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n\u201cWe are ready not only to purchase this form for President Jonathan but I want to assure you that our Community, the Nomadic Pastoralists, have a voting population of about 9million youths, who can also produce about 5 million! So, we have about 14 million voters. We have other Nigerians who can give us 2million votes and we are home and dry.\n\n\u201cGoodluck Jonathan is the best president for Nigeria and I hope with this purchase of forms today, I call on all the aspirants if they are really patriotic, if they want Nigeria\u2019s unity, if they want sense of belonging, if they want a president for all, if they want a president that has come out to say his ambition does not worth the blood of any Nigerian no matter how lowly or highly placed such Nigerian is and he lived to that word when the chips were down, I think it is time for Nigerians to tell that man to come back and lead us.\u201d\n\nLawan\n\nFor Senate President Lawan, a group led by a chieftain of the party from the South-east region, Sam Nkire, obtained the forms for the Yobe born politician while the minister\u2019s forms were presented by a large crowd comprising women, youth and the Northern Solidarity Groups.\n\nHe told journalists \u201cSenator Lawan is in the contest to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here; you can see beside and behind me Senators and senior members, businessmen and politicians who are members of the All Progressives Congress and some other Nigerians who want a new president,\u201d Nkire said.\n\nAdvancing reasons for Lawan candidacy, he said: \u201cNational stability is one. A president that we are bringing for the Nigerian people is a Nigerian president, not an Ibo president, not a Fulani president, not a Yoruba president, but a Nigerian president who we have watched and see that there would be no other candidate that will be so level-headed and someone who has the feeling of the poor Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are not here on our own, we have his backing. Even though friends and brothers contributed to purchase this form for him, but he has given us the go ahead.\u201d\n\nOn zoning, he said: \u201cLet me tell you, you\u2019re a journalist not a politician. Every politician is in politics to win. It is PDP that is driving us to do this, we have said so. But we don\u2019t want PDP to take the government from us. If you give the position to a southerner and PDP gives to a northerner, APC will go into the wilderness and we are not ready to go into the wilderness.\u201d\n\nSylva\n\nSimilarly, a large crowd of supporters, led by the Northern Solidarity Group Monday besieged the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Towers to ask the Mr Sylva, to also take a shot at the nation\u2019s plum seat.\n\nThe large crowd comprising women, youth and the NSG presented the forms to the minister.\n\nSpeaking after picking the forms, spokesman of the group, Suleiman Abdullahi, said the minister stood better chances of winning both the ticket and the general elections, hence the need for the support.\n\nAbdullahi said: \u201cWe picked this presidential nomination forms to surprise the Minister state for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, to contest for the presidency of this country, which we found him capable to do. We are his fans from the Northern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians can see from his antecedent from the state level to the federal level that he has garnered necessary experience and well acceptable across the country. So we know that his chances of winning the ticket of the APC is brighter.\u201d\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd, Mr Sylva expressed joy for the love shown to him by Nigerians from all walks of life.\n\n\u201cI feel very honoured and humbled for the show of love and this show of commitment not to me, but to Nigeria. I have tried my best since I was appointed by Mr. President to this office to do my service to Nigeria. But to realise that my efforts have been noticed by you Nigerians and that you Nigerians by yourself will go and take the trouble of obtaining the nomination and the expression of interest forms for me is very humbling. And I must also say very shocking at the same time.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m very happy and pleased by this gesture. So what I will do now, I will not give you a straight answer right now. But I\u2019m really thankful for what you have done because I need to consult, I need to consult my constituency and consult leaders of this country and then I\u2019ll come back to you to let you know if I have taken the position also to run for this office.\n\n\u201cI thank you very much. So you\u2019ll give me a very short time. I will start right away with the consultation. I will go to my leader, for example the Ijaw Leader Sir SK Clark, I will talk to him. I will also consult other leaders of the country and I will get back to you.\u201d\n\nEmefiele\n\nHowever, in a twist, a Federal High Court in Abuja Monday refused to grant a restraining order requested by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele, against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami, SAN, on his presidential ambition.\n\nEmefiele had through his counsel, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, applied for an order of status quo ante bellum to be made against INEC and AGF so that he would not be made to resign from office until 30 days to the general elections.\n\nIn an ex-parte application argued Monday, Emefiele denied being a political appointee but a public servant not caught by section 84 (12) of the new Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe CBN governor asked the court to invoke section 318 of the 1999 Constitution to bar the defendants from asking him to vacate office until 30 days to the February 2023 presidential elections.\n\nEmefiele expressed apprehension that sale and submission of presidential nomination form would expire Wednesday and that unless the INEC and AGF were ordered to maintain status ante bellum as at May 5 when he filed the suit, he would be made to vacate office before his forms would be accepted by the appropriate authority.\n\nHowever, in a brief ruling, Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed turned down Emefiele\u2019s request for the order.\n\nAPC party to beat \u2013 Fayemi\n\nIn a related development, Ekiti state Governor John Kayode Fayemi has provided an insight into why there is so much interest by aspirants vying for the exalted seat of the presidency on the APC platform..\n\nFayemi who is among 25 aspirants that have so far picked the presidential forms said there was huge interest because APC was well placed to sweep the poll in 2023.\n\nHe spoke while receiving members of the National Prosperity Movement from North-east and North-west at his campaign office Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe are once again in the throes of another national electoral cycle at which Nigerians across the length and breadth of the nation will be called upon to designate their preferred choice for the leadership of our beloved country.\n\n\u201cAs can be expected, our great party, the APC will be a key factor and actor in the elections. And that is as it should be given that we are the ruling party at the federal centre, and are responsible for governing 22 states in the federation. Easily, we are the most national of parties. We also remain the most sought-after political association in the land.\n\n\u201cIt will not be an exaggeration, and I know most of you will agree as well, that given our present preponderance in the national political system, the forthcoming elections will be very much about us as a party as about anything else. Nigerians reposed considerable trust in us when they voted us into office in 2015 and renewed our national mandate in 2019.\n\n\u201cThat trust also came with and continues to carry enormous responsibility that we have tried, even in the face of various odds, to discharge as faithfully as possible. As it is, all things considered, we are the party to beat in 2023.\u201d\n\nFayemi expressed the need for APC not to be complacent ahead of the 2023 poll, adding that he is on the verge of developing a blueprint aimed at addressing the security challenges in the country.\n\nHe promised to spare no effort to win the fight against insecurity, banditry, unemployment, poverty, inequality, threats of national disintegration, and lawlessness.\n\nThe presidential hopeful assured that \u201ca detailed blueprint with corresponding timelines of implementation will be employed to guide the speedy and accelerated retooling of key institutions of state, including the armed forces, the police service, and the civil service.\n\n\u201cThe renewal of the capacity, agility, and credibility of the key institutions of state must necessarily be accompanied with comprehensive policy initiatives designed to tackle the roots of the problems that have continued to wrack our country and test the hopes of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo hosts state assembly speakers\n\nAnd in continuation of his consultation with stakeholders ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had met with speakers of the state House of Assembly.\n\nHe said consultations with the people were critical in governance and important for national development, especially in a country as diverse and complex as Nigeria.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesperson, Laolu Akande, in a statement Monday, said the vice president had a dinner with speakers and deputy speakers of a number of State Houses of Assembly on Sunday at his official residence in the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAccording to the vice-president, government by partnership is very important.\n\n\u201cThat is the kind of relationship that I think makes governance easier. The only way to make a complex country like this work is by consultations; there is no other way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe VP said he would apply the partnership model in governance if nominated by the APC as its presidential flag bearer and ultimately elected as president.\n\n\u201cIn terms of training on the job, I think I am quite well trained. So, I believe very strongly that, although there are other contestants who are also very capable and competent, I believe that just in terms of readiness, I think that if there is anyone who is prepared for that, I am certainly that person.\n\n\u201cSo, if by the grace of God, I am nominated by the party and the electorate, I think that God helping us, we will be able to do much in office. And one of the very important things for me is what I would describe as a partnership,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo recalled his tour of the Niger Delta in 2017 on behalf of the president, which birthed the administration\u2019s Niger Delta New Vision and restored peace and stability, among other significant development gains in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat engagement taught me something very crucial, the most important thing of all in this country, is for us to be able to sit down and talk on any issue.\n\n\u201cPeople want to be able to express their views, and they want to be heard/helped, and we must create the time to hear them to understand their views.\n\n\u201cWhatever policy that is, engagement is always the best approach, I think that has succeeded in so many instances. I am confident that the partnership model is one that will always work.\u201d\n\nIn their remarks, the speakers and deputy speakers commended the vice president for his efforts in the general development of the country, while many of them endorsed his aspiration to become president in 2023.\n\nPledging his support for the vice president, Speaker of the Niger State House of Assembly, Abdullahi Wuse, said the vice president had the best of the capacity to lead as from 2023.\n\n\u201cFew people have the intellectual capacity, the capabilities that you are exhibiting as the vice president of this country. We look forward to a situation where you will be the President; I believe that you will do more if given the opportunity to be president of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Speaker Ogun State House of Assembly Olakunle Oluomo said Nigerians everywhere appreciated the vice president who had shown total capacity in leadership.\n\nAccording to him, the country will experience transformation if Osinbajo is elected president in 2023.\n\n\u201cHis coming will accelerate a lot of development in this country; also he will hit the ground running,\u201d he said.\n\nMore so, Katsina State House of Assembly Speaker, Tasiu Musa-Maigari, commended the vice president\u2019s good qualities of leadership\u2013 honesty, hard work and loyalty.\n\nHe said Osinbajo would make a very good president.\n\nIn his own remarks, Speaker Nasarawa State House of Assembly Ibrahim Abdullahi said VP Osinbajo had the requisite experience to lead the country.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your capacity and intelligence. And we are thankful that we have somebody like Osinbajo in this country. We don\u2019t need to be reminded that even the president trusts you so much, and trusts your capacity.\n\n\u201cYou love this country, and we are sure by the time the vice president takes over from President Buhari, you will start where he ends. By the special grace of God, the vice president will take over the ticket of the APC,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nAdamawa, Taraba APC delegates endorse Tinubu\n\nAlso, the APC National Leader and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, hasl expressed delight that his presidential bid received another boost in Adamawa and Taraba states where critical party stakeholders acknowledged his contributions to the establishment and stability of APC and the Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting with APC party delegates in the states weekend, Asiwaju Tinubu acknowledged the efforts of the Buhari administration at tackling the daunting security challenges bedevilling the country for over a decade.\n\nWhile advising the APC delegates to the forthcoming presidential convention not to compromise competence and experience in electing the party\u2019s presidential flag bearer, he also said there were more gains so far recorded by this government in the fight against Boko Haram insurgency, banditry and kidnapping.\n\nThe APC stakeholders had noted that Tinubu had all it takes to reposition Nigerian economy if given the mandate by the party based on his good track record as former senator and governor of Lagos state as well as APC national leader.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Remember that it is about food and nutritional security, the well-being of our farmers, improved income and less use of chemical sprays for environmental sustainability,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the safety of the improved PBR Cowpea, the director-general, National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, assured Nigerians the crop is safe for both human consumption and the environment.\n\nHe stressed that the PBR, genetically-modified with a non-harmful substance sourced from the soil (Bacillus Thuringiensis) that resists insect attacks and infestation of the staple food, was subjected to several rigorous risks analysis and safety tests by the Federal Government before approval for public consumption.\n\nAlso, the country coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology OFAB, Nigeria chapter, Dr. Rose Gidado, said Nigeria has etched her place in the comity of nations with the commercialisation of the PBR Cowpea. Nigeria\u2019s action, she said, has caused other African nations to come learn from her success. She stressed there is no difference between the conventional cowpea and the modified one. \u201cApart from being resistant to insects, they share the same characteristics in taste, colour, texture etc.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigerian Airlines Reach Truce with Government, Get Jet Fuel at N480 per Litre, Cancel Shutdown Plan",
          "text": "The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) on Monday reached a truce with the leadership of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives and other government agencies to cancel the plan of shutting down flight operations in the country. The operators had last Friday announced their plan to stop flight operations due to the high of\n\ncost of aviation fuel that had risen to N700 per litre. This, was however shelved.\n\nMeanwhile, at a meeting attended by the airline operators, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, (NNPC) Mele Kyari, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele and other stakeholders, the operators agreed to cancel the planned suspension of their services.\n\nAt the meeting chaired by the Speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, it was agreed that six million litres of jet fuel would be made available through the intervention of the CBN governor, at the rate of N480 to the operators.\n\nAs a long term measure they also resolved that the operators would begin the process of application for their licence to import jet fuel directly for their operations.\n\nReading the resolutions Gbajabiamila said: \u201cThat we move the language of suspension to canceled. That the issues of shut down has been canceled based on this meeting.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC and the airline operators both agreed that in the interim of three months, the marketers of choice that you are comfortable with and you know their markup will not drive you out of business would be supplied with jet fuel.\n\n\u201cThe third resolution is that in the mid-to-long term, in fact right now, you will begin the process of application for your own license for you to be able to import your own jet fuel, to assist you in your business. Also to the benevolence of the CBN governor that six million litres are available now at N480.\n\n\u201cYou will get allocation for the next three months through the companies you have nominated. In the process of application for license, midstream should as much as possible grant waivers that would not touch on the security and safety of the process. Committee chairmen on aviation and downstream should follow up.\u201d\n\nSpeaking for the airline operators, the Vice President of AON, Mr. Allen Onyema, alleged that their woes in the industry was compounded when the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited refused to make available 25,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel approved by President Muhammadu Buhari to be sold to them at landing rates to ameliorate the losses they suffered over the months.\n\nOnyema who is the Chairman of Air Peace, told the gathering how his association was invited by the Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority (NMDRA) to notify them of the President\u2019s gesture, and the need for them to nominate trusted and established marketers to take delivery of the 25,000 MT and sell to them at the landing rate.\n\nHe said having nominated 10 established marketers to take the product, he, in the presence of his members, called the NNPC GMD informing him of the President\u2019s gesture and that their selected marketers would be in touch regarding the product, adding that Kyari refused.\n\n\u201cWe were told that a week later that is when the consignment would be arriving Nigeria and when this happened, the next we got to hear from the marketers was that they had already been given the consignment that we were all jostling for.\n\n\u201cSo we waited thinking that they would sell as agreed. They never. I actually called the MD of NNPC, in the presence of our members. We wanted to hear from him. He answered that there was no way they would leave us to get direct products that it was dangerous.\n\n\u201cBut I said no, that the marketers you are going to give are the same marketers that would handle it for us. He said he did not want any crash or anybody adulterating it. I said how could they adulterate it because they are the same marketers.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking it on our own. Long and short of the story is that this product was not given to us and we noticed that it continued rising and rising,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President of the Association, Abdulmanaf Yunusa who\u2019s also the Chairman of Azman Air, corroborated the allegation levelled against the NNPC GMD.\n\nIn his response, Kyari said they considered safety issues involved in releasing aviation fuel directly to operators, or even marketers, saying that not everyone can handle ADK which necessitated his refusal.\n\n\u201cIt is more complex than they say. Somebody must handle aviation fuel. We cannot surrender the safety of Nigerians to just anyone. It is not every marketing company that can handle ATK including the chairman\u2019s company.\n\n\u201cWe cannot give him. He has a marketing company. We cannot give ATK to handle. That is why they have to bring the people that we can deal with,\u201d the GMD said.\n\nWhen asked by Gbajabiamila if they can nominate those that can handle it, he said \u201cwhy not, we have no problem with that.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on the possibility of granting forex at a special rate for the airlines, Emefiele told the gathering that there was nothing the apex bank could do since it depends on forex generated by the NNPC through crude oil sales which has been quite low due to oil thefts in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cThe availability of forex is very important and the issue of constraint from forex arising from issues bordering on theft in the Niger Delta is a big issue. It is when NNPC is able to export that dollars can come in.\n\n\u201cWe do not have forex to sell. It would be difficult for us to grant any concession. It means we would be taking a hit or we would be providing some sort of subsidy for the industry\u201d, Emefiele said.",

          "title": "Aviation Fuel Cheaper in Nigeria Than Other West African Countries, Marketers Say",
          "text": "In a fresh revelation, marketers of petroleum products under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) have alleged that the federal government through the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has been subsidising the price of Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) commonly known as aviation fuel, in the past weeks, against the international price.\n\nMOMAN specifically said in comparative terms, the aviation industry was already benefitting from government\u2019s intervention when local prices are compared to West African regional prices, despite the deregulated status of aviation fuel.\n\nThe marketers warned that the situation was not sustainable given the already humongous N4 trillion annual subsidy cost being borne by the country.\n\nThe association stated this yesterday in a statement signed by its Chairman, Mr. Olumide Adeosun, which was sent to THISDAY.\n\n\u201cIn comparative terms, the aviation industry is already benefitting from government\u2019s intervention when local prices are compared to West African regional prices, despite the deregulated status of aviation fuel. This situation is hardly sustainable given the already humongous N4 trillion cost of the PMS subsidy,\u201d MOMAN stated.\n\nIt explained that with respect to aviation fuel, verifiable prices in West Africa ranged from $1.25 per litre in Ghana to as high as $1.51 per litre in Liberia, saying even then, the product has remained scarce across the sub-region.\n\nMOMAN maintained that due to the intervention of NNPC over the last several weeks, aviation fuel was landed into marine terminal tanks in Nigeria at between N480 and N500 per litre, depending on the logistics efficiency of the operator.\n\nIt further explained that, \u201cdue to high costs of specific handling of Jet A1 (special transport and continuous filtration), the product is sold on the tarmac at Ikeja (our benchmark), between N540 and N550 per litre and across other airports at between N570 and N580 per litre.\n\n\u201cDuring this period of NNPC intervention, as NNPC uses the nominal Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate, no independent importer would import aviation fuel as it is unable to access foreign exchange at the same rate, leaving NNPC as the major importer of aviation fuel for now, even though the product is deregulated.\u201d\n\nHowever, the marketers admitted that those interventions were sometimes necessary to mitigate shocks and help the economy, the operating environment and the public to adjust to the new realities while efforts were being made and innovations introduced to optimise costs and increase efficiencies.\n\nWhile noting that those interventions cannot be permanent in nature, MOMAN expressed hope that the war in Ukraine came to a speedy conclusion.\n\nIt also expressed hoped that the integration of products from the local refineries including the four NNPC\u2019s refineries under rehabilitation, the Dangote Refinery under construction as well modular refineries into the supply chain, would mitigate the high costs being borne by the government and Nigerians.\n\nMOMAN opined that a return to cost recovery, free market and competitive economics including access to foreign exchange at competitive rates was inevitable for the sustainability of the production and distribution framework in the petroleum downstream industry in the country.\n\nIt added that there was an immediate need to prepare the operating environment and indeed the larger economy for this eventual return.\n\nMOMAN restated its committed to the institutionalisation and sustainability of a viable petroleum downstream sector in Nigeria, pledging that it would continue to lend its support towards easing the burden of Nigerians at this difficult time.\n\nThe marketers also empathised with all users of petroleum products including airline operators, private vehicle owners, logistics and transport companies, manufacturers, cooking gas users in homes and all members of the public who were affected by the worldwide petroleum products price increases, which impact logistics, transportation, distribution, and operation costs.\n\nIt observed that the petroleum products downstream industry, which was engaged in logistics and distribution, was also suffering the impact of these higher costs brought about by the post-Covid world economy and the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the body, \u201cthe escalating fuel price cycle we find ourselves in, is unfortunate, MOMAN wishes to clarify to Nigerians that the situation in Nigeria is not country-specific, but a global issue.\n\n\u201cAviation fuel (Jet A1), like other petroleum products used in Nigeria is not produced in-country and is subject to international price movements which are currently suffering the twin shock of increased post pandemic demand and the ongoing sanctions against Russia, a large producer of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThese shocks have seen international trading premiums, costs of vessel freight, and other transport costs skyrocket to worrying levels. Separately, international traders are exploiting the situation by selling only to the highest bidders.\u201d",

          "title": "Former Senate President Saraki Meets Obasanjo, Warns Nigerians Against Electing President without Energy",
          "text": "One of the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) presidential aspirants, Dr. Bukola Saraki has met with ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo as he continues to campaign to delegates of the party ahead of its presidential primary elections, just as he warned Nigerian voters against choosing a candidate that has no stamina to endure the rigours of being the president of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nAlso, a former Vice President, Namadi Sambo, has stated that Saraki has the capacity and experience needed to lead Nigeria.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nHowever, speaking to delegates in Ogun State, Saraki said what Nigeria needed was a president that would stand bold and courageous.\n\n\u201cWe all know my four years as the Senate president, I stood for this country. I stood for what I believed was in the interest of this country. Let us find that person who has the energy because the work of a president is not part-time, especially now the country is very bad.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a president that is up and running, not a president that will be giving instructions because when you give instructions and you don\u2019t check, nothing will happen,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s ill health had stuck out like a sore thumb during the past seven years, with his critics advocating for a healthy and younger president in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nFrontline presidential aspirants Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar are also considered too old to rule Nigeria by their critics.\n\nSaraki insisted that, \u201cyou need somebody that has the energy to do it. I believe that I have the energy and capacity to do it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMany aspirants have been coming and will still come to you and promise many things. Listen to them and rate them according to what they have done in the past. They promised restructuring. You cannot restructure without the experience and political sagacity in the legislature. My experience cuts across the legislative and executive arms. We need a Nigerian for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nSaraki who was accompanied by PDP former National Chairman Abubakar Kawu Baraje, held a closed-door meeting with Obasanjo at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library.\n\nSaraki, while addressing journalists earlier after his meeting with Obasanjo, said Nigeria was in a delicate situation, and a wrong choice of president would spell doom for the country.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very, very delicate state as a nation, and we need somebody who has the experience, somebody who can unite us because, without unity, we cannot go anywhere,\u201d the ex-Kwara governor stressed.\n\nOn why he visited Obasanjo, the former Senate president said, \u201cI\u2019m in Ogun state to see PDP delegates, but I can\u2019t come to Ogun state and not pay a visit to the former president, our father and leader of modern Nigeria, somebody I\u2019m very closed to since I started my political career, so I came to see him to let him know that I\u2019m in Ogun state and to see how good and how well he is doing. \u201cAnd we thank God for his health, his energy and his passion for this great country. It inspires us to see that definitely, we need to turn this country around into a country that he wishes for and that all of us wish.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Sambo, has stated that Saraki has the capacity and experience needed to lead Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe is a young man, strong and healthy. Being President is not an easy job. That office needs people like Bukola Saraki. We will pray that Almighty God, who gives power to whoever he wishes, will guide you and support your aspiration,\u201d Sambo told Saraki at the weekend, during the PDP aspirant\u2019s visit to meet with Kaduna leaders and delegates in Kaduna State.\n\nThe former VP emphasised that he and Saraki served as governors at the same time, saying since then, he had always known that Saraki cared about Kaduna and the North-western part of Nigeria.\n\nA statement by the ex-Kwara governor\u2019s media aide Olu Onemola further quoted the former vice president to have said: \u201cI remember, when I was governor, he gave special attention to Kaduna state. As the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, sometimes, I felt like his \u2018self-appointed deputy\u2019 \u2014 even though the forum has no deputy.\n\n\u201cThis is because we had a close working relationship and a great personal relationship. I want you all to know that Saraki is a team player. He is a man who plays with and for the team. I have always known him to be a very honest person who has capacity.\n\n\u201cAs the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, he formed the Peer Review Mechanism that allowed consultants to go state-by-state to report the development plans and progress of each state to the Governors Forum. This helped all the governors to meet the plans and objectives of the PDP government at the time.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Saraki being a bona fide presidential aspirant, Sambo described him as an organiser and economically vibrant politician.\n\n\u201cAs the governor of Kwara State, he set up the foundation for commercial agriculture. Today, in Agriculture, the arrangement that he set up in Shonga Farms has become a model that each state in Nigeria is emulating,\u201d explained the former vice president.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate President, we all know the success that he brought to this nation. This is why I trust that if our party and our delegates give Saraki the opportunity, he will further prove what I am saying.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, on Monday met with National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, in Abuja, a reliable source informed THISDAY. The meeting, THISDAY gathered, took place few hours after a Fulani group, under the aegis of the Nomadic Pastoralists and the Almajiri Communities, purchased the ruling party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, sold for N100 million, for Jonathan. They urged him to contest for president under the party in 2023.\n\nThe sale of forms for elective positions in APC closes Tuesday, with 25 aspirants in the race for the presidential ticket in the party\u2019s primary election slated for May 30, 2023.\n\nLikewise, 72 hours after a coalition of 28 groups bought the N100 million APC forms for the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, he is yet to deny that he nurses presidential ambition. The AfDB president also met with President Muhammadu Buhari in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, during the ongoing conference organised by the United Nations.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu held at a secret location in Abuja and lasted about an hour, specifically between 9pm and 10 pm. At the end of it, the former president and the national chairman came out smiling, THISDAY learnt. Although the agenda of the meeting was not disclosed, it further strengthened speculation about the former president\u2019s likely defection to the APC which has been topic of discussion in political circles in the last two years.\n\nJonathan, in a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, said he was not aware of the purchase of forms and did not authorise it.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt has come to the notice of His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the APC in his name.\n\n\u201cWe wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 presidential election, we wish to state, that he has not in anyway, committed himself to this request.\n\n\u201cWe thank the general public for their concern, as we continue to encourage citizens\u2019 participation in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nA reliable source had told THISDAY that some leaders in West Africa, which included presidents of Niger, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, might have spoken on behalf of the AfDB president to Buhari.\n\nThere had been speculations that Jonathan wanted to take another shot at the presidency but on the platform of APC, the party that defeated him in 2015. The former president recently hinted that he was still consulting on whether to join the race or not in 2023.\n\nThe leader of the Fulani group that purchased the form for Jonathan, Ibrahim Abdullahi, said a lot of interest groups had been coming out to urge Jonathan to contest, adding that they needed to purchase the form to beat the deadline.\n\nHe said Jonathan had a comprehensive policy while in government to reform and integrate the Almajarai into the educational system of Nigeria.\n\nAbdullahi added, \u201cIt was the dream and the vision of President Jonathan to produce doctors, lawyers and engineers from Almajarai, but unfortunately, that laudable vision was abandoned once he left office.,\n\n\u201cAnother group that he tried to develop was the Fulani pastoralists.

          "title": "Buhari Urges World Bank and AfDB to Activate $19bn Fund for Climate Investment",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the World Bank and African Development Bank (AfDB) to activate the $19 billion pledge, meant for land restoration, tree planting, development of climate resilience infrastructure and investments in small- and medium-sized farms.\n\nThe president, while calling on development partners to support the One Planet Summit initiative, also underscored the importance of recharging Lake Chad, now down to 10 per cent of its water volume, as 11 Sahel nations discussed ways and means of accessing the $19 billion pledged by donors for the activities of the Pan African Great Green Wall Agency (PAGGW).\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, at a side event he convened at the ongoing UN Conference of Parties, COP15, in his capacity as the president of the Conference of Heads of State and Governments of the member states of the PAGGW, Buhari said the fund would also support smallholder farmers, create an institutional framework to enhance security, stability and governance, and capacity building.\n\n\u201cAll of you may wish to know that, in December 2021, I was elected to lead and drive the Agenda of the PAGGW bloc for the next two years. This bloc, which includes Nigeria, Senegal, Niger, Sudan, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Djibouti, Burkina Faso and Chad, is facing dire and present danger due to the devastating effect of desertification and drought, which is impacting negatively on the security of our communities and the livelihood of our people,\u201d said Buhari.\n\n\u201cThere is, therefore, an urgent need to confront these challenges associated with desert encroachment and drought,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president explained that the inter-basin transfer of water from Central Africa to the Lake Chad should be taken seriously, asking the secretariat of the agency, funders and the soon-to-be appointed consultant to carry out the measure as a way of restoring the socio-economy of the more than 30 million people of the Lake Chad basin area.\n\nThe president canvassed more support for The One Planet Summit initiative and the political will to actualise the mandate.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that, on behalf of member states, I welcome The One Planet Summit Initiative that pledges $19 billion to support the activities of the PAGGW, which necessitated this very important engagement with you this morning,\u201d stressed Buhari.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, call on you, especially the World Bank, African Development Bank and the One Planet Summit Initiative, to support this drive.\u201d\n\nThe president also called on the multilateral institutions to set up a task team to work with PAGGW.\n\nAlso speaking, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed described the meeting as, \u201ca new era in the Great Green Wall programme\u201d and demanded from the agency, the 11 African nations, and the group of donors under the One Planet Summit to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI believe that the capacity and commitment of the secretariat of the PGGWA, working together with UNCCD, and your team will be in the best place to engage with partners to develop the pipeline that will ensure that across the countries we are speaking to today these efforts are made to come to realisation sooner than later,\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, Ibrahim Thiaw, described the coming together of Nigeria, Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti as \u201ca great inspiration,\u201d hoping the $19 billion pledged in Paris in 2021 would \u201cturn the dollars into hectares.\u201d\n\nFood Crisis: Buhari, Adesina Task Africa on Food Production, Reduced Dependency on Foreign Countries\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari and the President of AfDB, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina have called on African leaders to decouple the continent from food import dependency and avert looming food crisis by encouraging local production of food.\n\nThe duo made the call, while delivering their separate addresses in Abuja, at the opening ceremony of the first Conference of Speakers and Heads of African Parliaments (COSAP), with the theme: \u2018Strengthening Legislative Leadership for Africa\u2019s Development,\u2019 organised to deliberate on socio-political and economic progress in Africa and build a fairer world for all mankind.\n\nDelivering his opening address, Buhari who was represented by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo lamented that the COVID-19 induced serious challenge of food security and food inflation.\n\nThis he said calls for the need for the continent to free itself from all external mechanism, dependency and guarantee its own system by reducing food import dependency and ensuring increased productivity in agricultural sector of every African country.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cOver 30 million jobs lost since the pandemic with about 26 to 40 million people going into extreme poverty. Various African countries put in place extreme measures to curtail to effect of the virus and limit the socio-economic impact such as lockdowns and stimulus package.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, our stimulus program was to the tune of about N2.3 trillion. The post economic stimulus package for Africa must go beyond individual efforts that we have made in our countries. There is the need for increased collaboration and integration of efforts to drive sustainable economic growth and recovery across the African continent, our parliaments have a particular role to play aside from the fact that they have been charged to make laws to oversee government budgeting and international borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic induced serious challenge of food security and food inflation is now expected to rise above 12 percent this year. The pandemic also exposes the need for collaboration and networking. So, Africa must sustain cross border supply network that will connect global and domestic markets.\n\n\u201cThe agricultural sector is key towards ensuring productivity to improve our GDP. So, we must improve our agricultural production. we must produce our own food and reduce import dependency. The conflict in Ukraine has shown us clearly that we don\u2019t have to be dependent on other countries.\n\n\u201cAfrica parliamentary leadership must partner with the Executive, the rivals sector and all other stakeholders to design and implement framework that will support the agricultural sector in tackling food insecurity on the continent. The journey to a sustainable post COVID economic recovery is riddled with so much responsibilities for our government.\u201d\n\nOn debt cancellation, which was one of the key issues why the conference was being held, Buhari affirmed that the campaign for debt cancellation for African countries was already gaining traction.\n\nHe said, \u201cOne key issue during early discussions before this meeting is the issue of debt cancellation for African countries and this initiative is already gaining traction. One of those things that was discussed was the special drawing rights (SDR) of about $650 billion. Of course, there is the argument of how much African continent got. I think it is important to recognise that.\n\n\u201cThe Economic Commission for Africa recently proposed that our countries can help their financing needs by leveraging SDR through unbending vehicles such as liquidity sustainability facilities and multilateral and regional programs as well as the poverty reduction and growth plans.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the AfDB President, Adesina in his goodwill message said Africa should be decoupled from food import dependency as must feed itself and do so with pride.\n\nAdesina said, \u201cThis conference of speakers must be direct towards tackling the challenges facing our continent. Talking about the challenges it\u2019s not enough, there must be solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the growth and develop Africa as well the rest of the world. The trajectory of economic recovery from the pandemic is shaped by access to vaccines, and on this the divergence between a developed economies and developing economies is stuck.\n\n\u201cWe must not be complacent, next pandemic is just around the corner, God help us. Africa must build what I call Healthcare Defense System. This must include development of local vaccines and building quality healthcare infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe Russian war in Ukraine has added another challenge to what we are facing in Africa. the dependency of African countries on Russia and Ukraine, the war disruption has added to looming food crisis in Africa. The African Development Bank has designed a $1.5 billion emergency food production plan to support African countries to avert the looming food crisis.\u201d\n\nOn their part, Speakers and heads of African parliaments called on the global community to blacklist countries on the continent where undemocratic governments are in control.\n\nThey said the new trend of military coups could set the continent on a reverse gear of many years and erode the developmental gains achieved through constitutional democracy.\n\nSouth African Speaker, Hon. Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, raised the issue, expressing surprise that undemocratic governments were gradually returning to Africa.\n\nShe noted that this was against the African Union\u2019s position, which strongly opposed the undemocratic takeover of power.\n\nCorroborating her position, the Speaker of Zimbabwe, Hon. Jacob Matunda, stated that lack of growth in Africa was not due to a lack of ideas but the deliberate plot by the West to keep the continent in stagnation.\n\nAccording to him, an African leader elected into office by popular will or who comes up with innovative ideas is soon \u201cpunished\u201d, through any available method.\n\nThe Speakers therefore appealed to the global community not to recognise any African country where a coup brought in the government.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila said Africa\u2019s democracy was under threat, adding that the present insecurity and rampaging uncertainty across the continent represented the single biggest threat to the well-being of our children.\n\nHe lamented that despite Africa coming of age, the continent was far from achieving the highest potential.\n\nHe said leaders must invest in Africa\u2019s young people, protecting them, ensuring their health and well-being and providing them with a solid education upon which to build their future.\n\nTo deliver on this obligation, the Speaker said they must first ensure that the nations are at peace.\n\nGbajabiamila therefore, advised his African colleagues to wage the battle for peace with a warrior\u2019s resolve, adding that everything depends on victory over the forces that threaten African children\u2019s future.",
