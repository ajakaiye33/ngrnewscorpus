          "text": "Human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, has described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d, the civil war analogy by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), that he will treat young people misbehaving in the country in the language they understand.\n\nShe made this known in a video statement on Wednesday while reacting to a statement made by the President on Tuesday after meeting with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Mahmood Yakubu; and other electoral commissioners in Aso Villa, Abuja, over the series of attacks on INEC facilities, police stations and other public infrastructure in the South-Eastern part of the country.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Buhari said, \u201cIn the area of security, we have changed the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General, and we are demanding that they rise fully to the challenges confronting us. There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement which was also tweeted sparked outrage on social media with some Nigerians criticising the President while some said the President sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-East.\n\nReacting on Wednesday, Yesufu said, \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the President where the President is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 what a genocide, a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the activist said, \u201cFor a President to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Nigeria in dire straits, no efforts must be spared to stop the free fall\u2014 Gov Akeredolu\n\n\u2026Adds: Drop bicameral structure of NASS\n\n\u2026Says Nigerians\u2019 limit of endurance stretchedl1999 constitution below standard \u2014 Gbajabiamila\n\n\u2026Sanwo-Olu restates Special Status for Lagos\n\nBy Dayo Johnson, Regional Editor, South-West, Olasunkanmi Akoni & Tordue Salem\n\nChairman of the South-West Governors\u2019 Forum and governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, yesterday, said Nigeria is in dire straits and called for the adoption of a unicameral legislature, against the current bicameral structure.\n\nThis came on a day Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, said the 1999 Constitution has fallen short of the expectations of Nigerians, and thus needed a drastic overhaul.\n\nOn his part, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State reiterated the call for Special Economic Status for Lagos as the economic nerve centre of the country.\n\nUnicameral legislature better for Nigeria \u2014 Akeredolu\n\nAkeredolu, who spoke at the South-West zonal public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Constitution Review in Akure, Ondo State, said membership of the National Assembly should be on part-time basis.\n\nRepresented by his deputy, Mr. Lucky Aiyedatiwa, the governor said: \u201cThe country may consider dropping the current bicameral structure of the National Assembly and adopt a unicameral legislature.\n\n\u201cThe membership of the Assembly should be part-time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation, Fiscal and Allocation Committee and, more importantly, the people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity.\n\n\u201cThe Senate should be scrapped, while the House of Representatives too should not be unwieldy. A maximum of four representatives should come from each zone.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming increasingly embarrassing to those who reason deeply enough to observe that while the people wallow in despair, those who claim to represent them revel in ravenous opulence.\n\n\u201cThe number of public servants is very small compared with the humongous percentage of the commonwealth expended to maintain them.\n\n\u201cThere are too many ministries, departments and agencies of government that are moribund at all levels. It does not make economic sense to retain them.\n\n\u201cThere are several areas of overlap in the activities of government at both state and federal levels.\n\n\u2018Nigeria in dire straits\u2019\n\nOn the state of the country, Akeredolu said: \u201cThe country is in dire straits now. No efforts must be spared to stop the free fall.\n\n\u201cThe current experiences stretch the limits of endurance. Everyone tries to remain calm amid the raging storm.\n\n\u201cMore than ever, this period calls for cooperation from all stakeholders in the survival of the country.\n\n\u201cThe position of the Ondo State Government has been made public. We advocate a Federal Government largely reduced in size and scope of engagement.\n\n\u201cWe want to see a Constitution that will enhance the performance of public office-holders at all levels. It is possible to have a government that will serve the people in deed and truth.\n\n\u201cThe law of the land must aid this realistic expectation. We must reduce the cost of governance and shift attention to service delivery in this trying period.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the leader of the House of Representatives and chairman of South-West committee on constitution review, Mr. Ohio Akpatason, assured that after the public hearing, the National Assembly will produce a constitution that will meet the desires of all Nigerians.\n\n1999 constitution below standards \u2014 Gbajabiamila\n\nSpeaking at another forum, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila, noted that a nation\u2019s constitution is not only the foundation of its existence but is also supposed to set the terms of nationhood and define the manner that reflects its common truths and highest aspirations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Constitution Review: Akeredolu advocates scrapping of Senate\n\n\u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard,\u201d he said.\n\nThe speaker said the reason is the fact that the 1999 constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise entered into two decades ago to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and the country returned to a democratic government.\n\nGbajabiamila, who spoke in Lagos while declaring open the public hearing on the review of the constitution, said the National Assembly can only achieve the task after getting the inputs and support of the citizens.\n\nParticipants at the two-day public hearing included the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, who represented Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; members of the House of Representatives Special Committee on the Review of the Constitution; members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC; representatives of political parties, Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, youth organisations and market women.\n\nIn response to the doubts expressed in some quarters about the exercise, the speaker said: \u201cThe foundational constitution of the United States of America deemed people of colour to be \u2018less than\u2019 and denied women the right to vote. It did not include any limits on the President\u2019s term of office and allowed for citizens to be denied the right to vote for failure to pay the \u2018poll tax\u2019.\n\n\u2018No perfect constitution\u2019\n\n\u201c27 reviews and amendments, over one hundred years cured these and other defects. No nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one. We will not be able to deliver on this historic assignment if we restrict ourselves to tinkering around the edges of the constitution or by imposing upon ourselves artificial red lines that restrict honest conversation.\n\n\u201cAll of us in the House of Representatives will work conscientiously and in good faith so that it may be said of us in this process that we made an audacious attempt at creating for our nation a constitution that recognises our diversity and draws strength from it, and addresses once and for all, the fault lines that distract from nation-building.\u201d\n\nTyranny of low expectations\n\n\u201cIt is all too clear that many of our citizens have come to expect too little of our politics and government. We are suffering from the tyranny of low expectations and the cynicism that causes us to believe that the political process cannot produce anything worthy or worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI understand the causes of this cynicism, but I refuse to share in it. I still believe that politics and government in Nigeria can be a force for good and that by our common endeavour, we can achieve the vision of a just, peaceful, and prosperous society.\n\n\u201cHowever, beyond these public hearings, you still have an opportunity to make submissions that will be considered and that will help this process achieve the best outcomes. Please, by all means, participate. Let your voice be heard, and let your vision also inform the direction of this process.\n\n\u201cI urge all who have come to participate here today to do so with decorum and respect for one another. Let our deliberations be well-intentioned, well-informed and reflect our patriotism. In this way, we will have a most productive engagement over the next two days.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu restates special status for Lagos\n\nIn his remarks at the opening of the South-West Zonal public hearing of the House of Representatives Special Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, held in Ikeja, Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu insisted that a special status for Lagos State, with a huge population, must be a concern not only for residents alone but also for all Nigerians.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who was represented by his Deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, said: \u201cThe continuous request for a special status for the state is by no means a selfish one, but actually in the interest of every Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe need for this special status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me at this point to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cThe progress and prosperity of Nigeria are inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "African railway infrastructure space recognised him as the hand that raised Ghana\u2019s railway from death. Hon Joe Ghartey, academic, scholar and politician was a star boy in President Nana Akuffo Ado\u2019s first term cabinet.\n\nWhile his rising profile was too intimidating for some forces within ruling NPP, his sterling records of service and his rich political records are unforgettable in the search for 2024 succession. Out of cabinet, the former deputy speaker of Ghana\u2019s Parliament is garnering unsolicited awards and honours nationwide.\n\nIn Ghana\u2019s politics today, the most honest, electable, competent and politically unbeatable of likely 2024 contenders is Hon Ghartey, member of Parliament for Essikado Ketan Constituency. A sterling performer in Akuffo\u2019s first term, he urgently declared his interest in the Presidency to avoid playing the ostrich. While the President was pressured to remove his favourite Minister, recent happenings must have tutored the President that Ghartey is a true friend rather than enemy.\n\nThe lines some local voice did not want to hear is the truth. Hon Ghartey had mid-December spoke from political sincerity and courage: \u201cThere\u2019s only one truth. I contested for the last election and I came third. Akufo-Addo came first and Kyeremanteng came second and I was third. 2024 if God permits I will stand for the President of Ghana\u201d. The statement was in response to internal reading within the ruling party of likely contenders for 2024.\n\nThe reality for the ruling party now is that the President is widely distracted. President Nana Akuffo Ado must by now have confirmed identities of his real detractors. Supporters of Minister of Trade and Industry Alan Kwadwo Kyerematen and Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia are combatively daring a newly elected President who is barely four months into his tenure in office. They are sabotaging government while they pretend to be loyal to the President.\n\nCertain notions about 2024 succession is also ridiculous. A recent writer while reviewing the scheming noted as follows: \u201cThe notion that a person who became running-mate before he got a party membership card should feel aggrieved if he is not made the flag bearer, regardless of competence, religion or ethnicity is an insult to other party members of equal ability and greater dedication who have served the party since its founding without ever holding any office. Parties exist to win power so they can govern. In choosing candidates, there are only two legitimate considerations\u2013 Electability and then, Competence so that when elected, their performance would make their party more electable in future elections\u201d. I can\u2019t agree more.\n\nAnd back to the recent award, the organisers had this to say about the awardee: \u201cThe next awardee is also a lawyer and a politician. He took up a job as an associate at a chamber of lawyers in secondary year.\n\nHe later joined a firm of a kufre and co, a leading law firm in Ghana, which was co -founded by his future colleague parliamentarian, and cabinet minister in the John Kufur administration, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo, the current president of Republic of Ghana. As a speaker and a teacher, he has also lectured in various fields of law and investment. He was an adjunct lecturer of investment law at the University of Ghana Business School. He has also served as Lecturer in corporate governance and Executive MBA at the Ghana Ec of management and public administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s currently the Member of Parliament for a constituency in the western region. He was first elected to the seat in December 2004 elections, and was re-elected in December 2008, December 2012, December 2016 and December 2020. He was appointed Deputy Attorney General and Deputy Minister of Justice in 2005. He was promoted and appointed substantive Attorney General and Minister of Justice in 2006, a position he held on the January 2009. The Ghana ministers of state excellence honours recognises his remarkable achievements as a former Minister of State for his stellar performance in the course of his duties\u201d, the organisers narrated.\n\nResponding to the award, Hon Ghartey stated as follows: \u201cIn the second term of President kuffur before I was a deputy Attorney general for one year, and from 2006 to 2009 I was Attorney General Minister for Justice. When we came into the minority , I was made the second deputy speaker of parliament. When we came back into government, I was the First Minister of railway development of the Akufor Addo government, from 2017 to 2020. We started off the Parliament with Ministry of Railway Development within our office for about five, six months with our staff. We started off with parliament, and we did our best and we are happy that the people have recognised the effort.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for opportunities. And we thank the President for that appointment. I thank the organisers for this award. I asked about how they came to their conclusion and they said it involved screening and submissions from the general public as well. So I thanked the general public for recognising what we tried to do. It is gratifying to know that when you\u2019re in your small corner working, some people are noticing what you\u2019re doing. I thank the good Lord, for his mercies still endure, ever faithful and our faithful, ever sure.\n\nI thank the President for his appointment I thank the people of Ghana for their patience. And then, my family, for their endurance and not to forget all the people that I worked with, sometimes close at midnight so I know I\u2019m difficult to work with because we never rest and we are going to continue to put in our better, best. That\u2019s how we go.\n\nThat\u2019s how we are continue to be. So, the people who I worked with all the team directors, Baba, the security man who had to stay awake when I was never going home we thank all of them. God bless you.

          "text": "Full Year 2021 Financial Highlights\n\n\u25cf Revenue grew by 36% to N109.5 billion\n\n\u25cf Operating Profit increased by 39% to N7.6 billion\n\n\u25cf Recorded Gross Profit Margin of 14.3%\n\n\u25cf Profit after Tax (PAT) increased by 73%\n\n\u25cf Recorded Earnings per share of 14.2 kobo\n\n\u25cf Proposed dividend of 7 kobo per share up 75%\n\nOn Friday, May 28, 2021, leading foods manufacturer, Honeywell Flour Mills Plc. (HFMP) announced its audited results for the year ended March 31, 2021. The company recorded an all-time high revenue of N109.5 billion, an increase of 36% over N80.4 billion posted in the previous year. This was due to increased production output and more efficient operational capabilities at its factories in Apapa, Sagamu and Ikeja.\n\nGiven the increase in production activities, challenges with forex and COVID-induced disruptions in global trade which affected the sourcing of raw and packaging materials, cost of sales grew by 41% to N93.9 billion from N66.5 billion in the previous financial year. However, the company\u2019s Operating Profit grew faster than revenue at 39%, from N5.4 billion in FY 2020 to N7.6 billion in FY 2021. This was attributable to improved efficiencies and cost optimisation strategies which saw selling and distribution expenses decrease by 8% to N5.5 billion, while general and administrative expenses only slightly increased by 4% from N2.4 billion in FY 2020 to N2.5 billion in FY 2021, despite double digit inflation during the period.\n\nConsequently, Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 73%, growing from N650 million in FY 2020 to N1.1 billion in the period under review.\n\nSpeaking on the Full Year 2021 financial results, Lanre Jaiyeola, Managing Director, Honeywell Flour Mills, Plc., said: \u201cIn an extremely challenging year caused by unprecedented global disruptions and uncertainties, we achieved 36% revenue growth and record-breaking success through sheer grit and doggedness of our workforce. We worked collaboratively towards the execution of our goals; improved production and cost optimisation, guided by a clear strategy and common purpose. We remain committed to ensuring the supply of affordable nutritious food products to Nigerians, and we continue to assure our shareholders of long-term profitable returns from Honeywell Flour Mills Plc.\u201d\n\nAccording to the company, the future of its business would be shaped by a continued investment in innovative product development, advanced technology infrastructure and operational efficiency.\n\nThis is evidenced by the efficient utilisation of its world-class factory in Sagamu, Ogun State which boasts an annual Pasta production capacity of 138,600 Metric Tonnes and contributed over N19 billion to the company\u2019s overall revenue in the 2021 financial year, its second year of operations. The company will continue to improve its product offerings in order to exceed consumers\u2019 expectations, increase market share, and deliver value to shareholders.\n\nHoneywell Flour Mills Plc is a leading foods company producing, marketing and selling of high-quality food products in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) space. The Company\u2019s range of products which have become staples in Nigerian homes includes: Honeywell Superfine Flour, Honeywell Bakers Delight Flour, Honeywell Pastry Flour, Honeywell Semolina, Honeywell Whole Wheat Meal, Honeywell Macaroni, Honeywell Spaghetti and the popular variety of Honeywell Noodles.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Ekaete Bassey\n\nAward-winning 2face Idibia or 2Baba has opened up on why he married his wife, Annie Idibia Innocent despite having kids from several other women.\n\nThe ever-green \u201cAfrican Queen\u201d singer is a father of seven; five from his previous relationships with other women and two with his wife, Annie Idibia.\n\nIn an interview with Hypertek\u2019s Digital boss, he disclosed why he opted for Annie above others.\n\nHe explained all his baby mamas are well-to-do and very much learned but Annie possessed the latter and not the former.\n\n2Baba said: \u201cYou see Annie is from an average background like myself. We both started from nothing. She stuck by me through it all. When there was no car she hopped on bikes, took the bus, and trekked with me. When there was no money or house or hit song or millions of albums sold or big awards and accolades.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I used to repeat just 3 sets of clothes, she would always hold my head, look me in the eyes and tell me things will be fine one day. When I wasn\u2019t handsome, she would call me her prince charming. When I wasn\u2019t celebrated, she called me her king and said she is my number one fan and to this day, she still is.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEven when I made it big as a musician and started misbehaving and controversies almost destroyed my career, she would go down on her knees and pray to God to show me the way and give me victory over my enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow if am still that small boy struggling to make it like every other young chap on the streets of Lagos, do you think a doctor, a lawyer, and a multi-millionaire businesswoman would want to look at me or even have my kids? No, so to answer your question, I did not choose who had more to offer me, I chose Annie because she offered me her all when we had very little\u201d.",

He made very solid contributions to our educational road map. He was clearly one of the finest Mathematicians this country has ever produced. I feel a deep and personal sense of loss at his death. It is almost impossible to produce alternatives to men like Professor Obioma.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Niger state police command has dismissed reports that the NECO Registrar, who died on Monday, was assassinated.\n\nPublic Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Wasiu Abiodun, yesterday, in a statement, in Minna, described the story as \u2018totally false, untrue and a pure element of fake news.\u201d\n\nThe police, in the statement, further stated: \u201cIt is important to state, categorically, that on May 31, 2021, Prof Obioma was rushed to National Hospital Abuja by his family members, where he was later confirmed dead, after a brief illness.\n\n\u201cHe was said to have returned from Abuja for an official assignment at about 9:00am, in the morning, and was expected before his sudden death.\u201d\n\nWhile the wife said he died of heart attack, the son in a conflicting report said his father died after a brief illness.\n\nA short message sent by his son to NECO management read: \u201dDear Sir, this is to formally inform you that my father, Prof. Godswill Obioma, the Registrar/Chief Executive of NECO passed to eternal glory yesterday, 31/5/2021, after a brief illness.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Whip of the Senate and former governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, has expressed sadness over the demise of Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of National Examinations Council (NECO), Professor Godswill Obioma.\n\nDescribing the death of Obioma as a huge loss to the academia, the former governor acknowledged the contributions of the late Professor to nation building in various capacities.\n\nKalu, while commiserating with the Obioma family, prayed to God to repose the soul of the deceased.\n\nIn a condolence message, the Senate Chief Whip said: \u201cThe demise of the Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of National Examinations Council (NECO), Professor Godswill Obioma, is painful.\n\n\u201cThe late Professor contributed immensely to the academia in no small measure. He will be remembered for academic excellence.\n\n\u201cOur prayers and thoughts are with the Obioma family at this period of grief.\n\n\u201cMay his gentle soul rest in peace\u201d.\n\nThe former governor condoled with the government and people of Abia state, while calling on the Obioma family to take solace in the fact that the deceased lived a remarkable life.",

It is supposed to set the terms of our nationhood and define who we are in a manner that reflects both our common truths and highest aspirations.\n\n\u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard because the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in other to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\n\n\u201cIt was always the intention that we will one day as one people and one nation, return to amend this document so that it gives voice to the yearnings of the Nigerian people and sets out in clear details how we intend to achieve the shared ambitions of our nationhood. Providence has cast upon the 9th National Assembly the responsibility to write such a constitution for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said Nigeria needs a \u201cnear-perfect\u201d constitution to correct the problems confronting the country.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu advocated the scrapping of the Senate with each zones having equal number of four representatives at the National Assembly.\n\nThis is as Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi state advocated constitutional roles to traditional rulers.\n\nThey spoke separately at the Akure Centre of the Southwest and Bauchi centre of the North East centre.\n\nAkeredolu, represented by his deputy, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, said the country should consider dropping the current bicameral structure of the National Assembly, and adopt unicameral legislature.\n\n\u201cThe membership of the Assembly should be part time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee, and the people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives too should not be unwieldy. A maximum of four representatives should come from each Zone,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu also stated that revenue generation and allocation must reflect the extent to which a state participated in the economy.\n\nHe equally called for state police, resource control, judicial reforms, especially with zones having their court of appeals.\n\nAkeredolu concluded by a return to the 1963 Republican Constitution, saying, \u201cWe will have resolved many fundamental issues of nationhood with the adoption.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the Bauchi center hearing, Governor Mohammed recalled that in the old Northern Nigeria, the British made use of them under indirect rule, said in spite of their non-recognition by the constitution, they were directly involved in the maintenance of law and order in their respective domains.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for traditional rulers to be given roles in the constitution, especially in the maintenance of law and order and other relevant areas.\n\n\u201cTaking into cognisance that even now that they are not recognised by the constitution, all the states of the federation depend on them.\n\n\u201cIn Northern Nigeria, when the British came, they used them under indirect rule and I do not know from where we got the wisdom to throw what we have so much in custody by allowing them to be redundant, ineffective, and at the same time putting so much responsibility on them.\n\n\u201cThis is because whenever we have problems, we rush to them, but we have never held them accountable and responsible for the duties we are expecting them to perform.\n\n\u201cWe believe we can give them constitutional responsibility, salary structure and scheme of work , so that they will be able to discharge their responsibilities without forcing them into redundancy or corruption,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi canvasses Nigeria anchored on justice, fairness, equity, inclusiveness\n\nWhile declaring the exercise open in Enugu, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi reiterated his administration\u2019s support for unequivocal and unwavering commitment to an egalitarian Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and inclusiveness shall be functional directive principles of state policy.\n\nThe Enugu centre has Anambra and Ebonyi states. Declaring it open the governor further enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organizations, stakeholders and the entire Enugu State citizenry \u201cto stand up and be counted in this important national discussion.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, Deputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Okechukwu, on behalf of the Speaker, Gbajabiamila and the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of the House Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, Idris Wase, welcomed Ugwuanyi and other participants to the event.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the ongoing exercise, if well harnessed, presents the Nigerian government and people with ample opportunity to find answers to the myriads of pressing challenges facing our nation today.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we assure you that your views will count. Whatever views and memos you submit here today and tomorrow will form part of the working documents and views of the Constitution Review exercise by the 9th Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Lalong advocates stiffer punishment against constitutional violators\n\nPlateau Governor, Simon Lalong called for stiff penalties against anyone found guilty of abusing the constitution so as to protect its sanctity as the highest instrumental of power and make it the main driver of Nigeria\u2019s democratic journey.\n\nHe observed that beyond amending the constitution, Nigerians must also take greater interest in how the constitution is implemented to avoid abuses that end up creating distortions and leading to agitations for more amendments.\n\n\u201cMy advice to the members of the National Assembly and indeed all Nigerians is to put in place strong safeguards in the new constitution to avoid the abuse of power. The situation where people flagrantly disobey, discard and ignore the provisions of the constitution should no longer be tolerated.\n\n\u201cWe should ensure that those who temper with the provisions of the constitution are seriously punished. No matter how frequently we amend the constitution, there may not be any difference if we fail to subject ourselves to its provisions. As citizens, we are the guardians and defenders of the constitution who can either make it work or fail by our actions or inactions. Nigerians should wake up from their slumber and lethargy by ensuring that they employ all legitimate means to protect the constitution. The days of docility are far gone\u201d.\n\n\u2022Akwa Ibom calls for free education, state police\n\nAkwa Ibom State government advocated making free education and compulsory education from primary to secondary level a constitutional issue in order to ensure that all children benefit from education in their early lives.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel also said states should be allowed to control their resources so that they could develop at their own pace.\n\nEmmanuel who was represented by the secretary to Akwa Ibom State government, Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, reasoned that the present high rate of insecurity could be better handled if the constitution makes room for the establishment of state police.\n\nHe, however, said the state believed in one indivisible entity called Nigeria in which everyone\u2019s rights and privileges would be protected and guaranteed.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, who was represented by the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zaccheaus Adangor, advised members of the committee not waste time in ensuring that the amendment is promptly implemented after collating all submissions and memoranda by the people\n\nWhile lamenting that cost of elections is tremendously expensive, making it difficult for public office holders to do what their communities want, Wike called for an outright drafting of a new constitution where input from every segment of the society would be considered since the present 1999 constitution has outlived its usefulness.\n\n\u2022NLC urges NASS to retain minimum wage in Exclusive List\n\nOn its part, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) appealed to National Assembly not to remove national minimum wage from the Exclusive list.\n\nMr Uchenna Ekwe, head of International Relations Department, Liaison to NASS, NLC, made the appeal in Enugu.\n\nHe said allowing the issues of the minimum wage in the Federal Government\u2019s exclusive list was part of democratic processes. Ekwe noted that those canvassing for its removal were ignorant of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) laws and making a vital mistake.\n\n\u201cThe laws allow issues of national minimum wages be maintained by the Federal Government.\u201d",

He declared June 11 and 12 as national days of prayers for Nigeria to win the war against banditry, killings and kidnappings across the nation. He also demanded immediate and temporary closure of schools in the North West and North East until adequate security is put in place to guarantee the safety of students.\n\nAsefon, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, in an interview with journalists, said insecurity had reached a frightening peak, as students no longer go to school with the guarantee that they would return home safely.\n\nHe decried that barely 24 hours after students of Greenfield University in Kaduna were released by their abductors, about 200 students of Islamiyya School were kidnapped in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, in a shocking and bizarre fashion.\n\nHe said incessant and incurable kidnapping of students in the North West and North Central calls for immediate and radical action.\n\n\u201cNANS under my leadership, having considered the continuous threats to the lives of our students and the lukewarm pace of security apparatuses to these nefarious crimes, we regrettably call on government to order immediate and temporary closure of all schools in the North West and North Central until adequate security is put in place.\n\n\u201cGovernment and security apparatuses have failed us, we can no longer trust them. We are daunted by the endless news of kidnapping of students in their hundreds within the last two years. This development is not only unacceptable, it challenges the very fabric of our national development, unity, cohesion and portends grave danger to our educational institutions.\u201d\n\nAsefon, who stated that while NANS regretted that the situation could degenerate to this abysmal point to warrant the demand, said he was left with no practical alternative than to ask for the closure of schools.\n\nDescribing prayers as the pillar of success for any nation, NANS declares 11th and 12th June, as the national students\u2019 day of prayers for the repose of the students, who died in the hands of kidnappers and for the safe return of those still being held hostage by these evil doers.\n\n\u201cPrayers shall also be offered to God to give our leaders and security personnel the wherewithal and wisdom to win the fight against banditry.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Vows attacks on INEC\u2019s assets won\u2019t stop future elections\n\n\u2022Reassures Nigerians no third term ambition\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday vowed to deal with those bent on destroying the nation through assaults on public buildings and institutions.\n\nHe also assured Nigerians that despite security challenges facing the country, all future elections will be conducted as scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari, while receiving a delegation of INEC, led by its National Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at the State House, Abuja, committed his administration to providing adequate financial backing for the commission\u2019s operations.\n\nThe INEC delegation came to brief the president on the series of attacks on facilities of the electoral body nationwide.\n\nThe deteriorating security situation in the country also engaged the attention of the National Assembly yesterday with the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, stressing the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the Senate was tired of observing one-minute silence for victims of insecurity.\n\nMedia adviser to the president, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement issued at the end of the closed-door session with the INEC officials, quoted Buhari as reiterating that he has no intention of staying in office beyond 2023.\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, the president assured the commission that his administration will do all within its powers to mitigate the effects on the conduct of future polls.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do that so that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nHe, however, warned those bent on destroying the country through promoting insurrection, and burning down critical national assets to back off as a rude shock awaits them soon.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in Nigeria is now mentioned all over the world. All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time,\u201d he stated.\n\nBuhari recalled that he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 elections, \u201cand majority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, those misbehaving in certain parts of the country are too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian civil war.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the service chiefs and the Inspector General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nShedding more light on his meeting with the INEC officials via his official Twitter handle, Buhari tweeted: \u201cI received a briefing today from the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Yakubu had said so far, 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide had been recorded, since the 2019 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections. \u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections. The intention is to incapacitate the commission, undermine the nation\u2019s democracy and precipitate a national crisis.\u201d\n\nLawan Seeks More Legislative Interventions to Secure Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has stressed the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe stated yesterday that that the lawmakers were tired of observing one-minute silence for the victims of insecurity.\n\nThe Senate also expressed concern about the frequency of the one-minute silence usually observed at its plenary as a result of deaths associated with security challenges facing the nation.\n\nSo far, it has observed one-minute silence six times in recent times for those who lost their lives through killings and murders in the wake of security issues across the country.\n\nLawan, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, said: \u201cLet me observe that we have observed about six one-minute silence and most of it was to pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians who were murdered or killed by criminals.\u201d\n\nHe called for the intensification of legislative interventions by the National Assembly to protect Nigerians from the heightening insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to him, it is imperative for the National Assembly to step up legislative interventions to reduce the number of deaths caused by criminal activities.\n\nHe added that such interventions would be backed by collaborative efforts among the legislature, executive and Nigerians to address the security challenges.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is very important that we step up our legislative intervention in ensuring that we protect the lives and properties of Nigerians to reduce the incidence of one-minute silence.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Senate and, indeed, the National Assembly, working together with the executive and getting the support of Nigerians, we can bring the much needed succour to our people, and that is why we are here.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee and, more importantly, people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped. The House of Representatives too should not be unwieldly. A maximum of four representatives should come from each zone.\u201d\n\nThe governor also advocated the decentralisation of the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court should be decentralised to ease the current burden of the appellate court.\n\n\u201cIn a true federal state, there should be a Supreme Court whose decisions are final in residual matters. The Supreme Court at the centre should concern itself mainly with issues bordering on constitutional interpretations and matters arising between and among the states and the federal government, as well as revenue generation by the federal government. It should also administer the National Judicial Council.\u201d\n\nIn Bauchi, the state Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, stated that Nigeria needed a workable and acceptable constitution to serve the interests of the people.\n\nSuch a document, he added, should allow for true federalism where Nigeria states are autonomous entities with power to run their affairs.\n\nThe governor also appealed to the House Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution to look into the various agitations of the state and reflect them in its report.\n\nAccording to him, the participatory approach by the National Assembly in the amendment of the constitution is expected to produce a people\u2019s constitution that will address the social-economic problems in the country.\n\nHe added that Nigeria must break from the command structure imposed on the country by the defunct military government, which concentrated enormous power at the centre as manifested in the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe constituent units of the Nigerian federation represented by the current 36 states, the FCT and the 774 local government areas are near to the people that must be given enough powers with resources in order to positively impact the lives of the people at the grassroots,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn Lagos State, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, restated his calls for a special economic status for the state owing to its status and the economic epicentre of the nation and the burdens it bears.\n\nHe said at the South-west zonal public hearing that the continuous request for a special status for the state was by no means a selfish one, but stemmed from the interest of every Nigerian in the state.\n\nHe stated that progress and prosperity of Nigeria as a nation is linked to that of Lagos State.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, while urging Nigerians to take the ongoing constitutional amendment seriously, had said the process of review and amendment would give the nation a near perfect constitution.\n\nHe expressed optimism that such a new constitution will resolve the issue of \u201cidentity, political structure, human rights, administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else that has made our nation fragile and that has hindered our progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe 1999 Constitution is as a result of a hurried national compromise that Nigeria entered into two decades ago, just to allow the military vacate the political scene and return to the barracks. It has always been our intention that one day, as one people, we will return to amend this document to give voice to the yearning of the Nigerian people\u201d.\n\nIn Enugu, the Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, reiterated his administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to an egalitarian Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and inclusiveness shall be functional directive principles of state policy.\n\nThe governor had declared the state government\u2019s support for amending the constitution to enhance the nation\u2019s quest for unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail.\u201d\n\nDeclaring open the South-east zonal public hearing in Enugu, the governor enjoined all institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and the entire Enugu State citizenry \u201cto stand up and be counted in this important national discussion.\u201d\n\nWomen groups, organisations and labour unions made varying submissions on how to improve the constitution.\n\nLabour unions demanded autonomy for local government, the legislature and the judiciary for improved service delivery, autonomy.\n\nAlso, women groups called for gender parity and inclusion to allow women to participate actively in governance and decision-making.\n\nSultan Seeks Removal of Immunity Clause\n\nOn his part, the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, saying it will compel leaders to live up to their responsibilities.\n\nHe also advocated a constitutional role for traditional rulers, saying it was time Nigerians talk frankly on how they want the country managed.\n\nAddressing stakeholders at the Kebbi zonal hearing comprising Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, the sultan attributed the crisis in the country to the relegation of traditional rulers as they were given no constitutional role to play.\n\nHe said before the Nigerian nation came into being in 1914, the traditional institution had existed.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the controversial issues, which I feel strongly about is the immunity clause. When you are immune, nobody can take you to court as a leader and it means that you can do whatever you want to do. You can claim to be God.\n\n\u201cBut when that immunity is removed and you are made to live in a society where people are taken to court for abuse of office, I think our leaders here will wake up. Let us see how to tinker with that immunity clause.\n\n\u201cWill it be better to give immunity to a few people or remove the immunity so that all of us will be equal? It is another food for thought. So, please don\u2019t hold back, speak your mind on how you want this country to move on.\u201d\n\nPlateau, Benue, Nasarawa Demand Devolution of Power, Single Tenure for Presidents.\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau, Benue, and Nasarawa states have unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nThey also requested that the state governors, as the chief security officers of their states, be given the powers to control the police in their states to enhance quick and rapid response to crisis and crime.\n\nThey decried the situation where a state police command has to get clearance from Abuja to respond to crisis in its domain.\n\nPresenting their memoranda at the North-central zonal public hearing in Jos, the three states also advocated a single tenure of five years for the president.\n\nPresenting the position of Benue State, representative of the governor, and Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Hon. Titus Ugba, urged the National Assembly to grant the demands of people seeking creation of additional states.\n\nPlateau State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Chrisantus Ahmedu, and his Nasarawa State counterpart, Abdulkareem Kana, who toed the same line with Ugba on most of their demands, added that the three tiers of government could be reduced to two; comprising only the federal and state governments, such that states are given the resources to cater for the local governments.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the audience, Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong, had urged Nigerians to be bold, sincere and patriotic in their submissions to the constitution review panel in their quest for a greater nation.\n\nLalong stated that the much-talked about restructuring will be considered to ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\nAccording to him, there are high expectations that this particular exercise will not go the way of previous ones which failed to address some key issues affecting the governance of the nation, leading to further agitations that are growing and in some way threatening peace, security and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to members of this special committee and Nigerians presenting memoranda at this public hearing to see this exercise as a very important duty which presents another opportunity for us to build a Nigeria that we desire to see. We should take advantage of the platform to ventilate and make submissions as to what we want injected or removed from the 1999 Constitution to make it more people -centred,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria\u2019s July production pegged at 1.579m bpd\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nCrude oil prices yesterday climbed to the highest point in more than two-and-a-half years, after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ forecast a tightening global market.\n\nBrent crude, Nigeria\u2019s oil benchmark, crossed the much-awaited $70 mark, hitting $71.33 at a point. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose as much as 3.8 per cent to $68.87 a barrel, a level it has failed to hold for a sustained period since 2018.\n\nHowever, the climbing oil price could worsen Nigeria\u2019s fiscal crisis as it portends the federal government spending more to keep the pump price of petrol stable at the current N162-N165 price band in view of the non-conclusion of talks with labour and other stakeholders on the need to float petrol cost in conformity with the policy on the deregulation of the downstream sector.\n\nThe new price levels were driven by expectations of growing fuel demand during the summer driving season in the United States as OPEC+ agreed to boost output and strong usage indications coming from China.\n\nOPEC+ also collectively agreed to continue a slow easing of supply curbs at its virtual meeting yesterday, coordinated from Vienna, as producers balanced an expected demand recovery against a possible increase in Iranian output.\n\nThe cartel, according to information garnered from the meeting, pegged Nigeria\u2019s July\u2019s reference production at 1.829million bpd, the country\u2019s adjustment was put at 250,000 bpd, while required output for the month is expected to be 1.579 million bpd.\n\nOPEC+ decided in April to return 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply to the market from May to July, anticipating rising global demand despite the high number of coronavirus cases in India, the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer.\n\nTraders also continue to follow the progress of negotiations between Tehran and world powers to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement, paving the way for increased oil supplies from Iran.\n\nAt the meeting, OPEC+ stuck to its plan to hike oil output in July, pressing ahead with an increase of 841,000 barrels a day in July, following hikes in May and June.\n\n\u201cThe demand picture has shown clear signs of improvement,\u201d Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said as the ministerial meeting started. His Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, also spoke of the \u201cgradual economic recovery.\n\nIf OPEC+ stays on course, and Iran oil\u2019s comeback is delayed, that should get WTI oil solidly above $70 a barrel, while Brent which has already exceeded $70 may then try to establish contact with the $75 region.\n\nThe surge was hovering at a level not seen since 2018 as August Brent contract rose earlier by $1.82, or 2.6 per cent, to $71.14 a barrel, a level not seen since November 2018 when measured on a continuous basis.\n\nOPEC Secretary-General, Dr Sanusi Barkindo, who spoke at the 30th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), said latest projections showed Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 5.5 per cent in 2021, up from 5.4 per cent at the last meeting.\n\nHe stated that the projections for oil are largely unchanged from last month, as demand is expected to grow by 6 mb/d to around 96.5 mb/d on average for the year, an increase of 6.6 per cent.\n\nHe stated that the market outlook for later this year looks especially promising, while anticipating that demand will surpass 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter, which would put OPEC back in the range of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBarkindo, who warned against complacency, stated that non-OPEC liquids production is now forecast to grow at a slightly slower pace than expected last month, rising by around 700,000 b/d in 2021 to an average of 63.6 mb/d.\n\nAccording to him, the actions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DOC) have continued to support the rebalancing process, and have helped reduce the global supply by more than 2.9 billion barrels since May 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, there continues to be significant overproduction by some of the participating countries. The overproduced volumes need to be accommodated to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting agreed to extend the very generous compensation period for overproduced volumes until the end of September 2021.\n\n\u201cOur continued contributions to sustainable oil market stability depend upon all participants achieving 100 per cent conformity and, where necessary, working dutifully to compensate for overproduction,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the meeting welcomed the positive performance of participating countries in the DoC, as overall conformity to the production adjustments was 114 per cent in April.\n\n\u201cIn view of current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook, the meeting reconfirmed the existing commitment of the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting in April 2020, amended in June, September, and December 2020, as well as in January and April 2021.\n\n\u201cThe agreement was to gradually return two million barrels a day (mb/d) of the adjustments to the market, with the pace being determined according to market conditions,\u201d OPEC stated in a release after the meeting.\n\nIt noted that compensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting and reconfirmed the decision on production adjustments for July as well as schedule its next meeting for July 1.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction. One girl, Leah Sharibu was not released by Boko Haram under the claims that she refused to renounce her Christian faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 300 schoolboys abducted in Kankara, Katsina in December 2020\n\n\n\nA gang of gunmen suspected to be bandits with links to Boko Haram terrorists attacked the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State to Abduct over 300 boys on December 11, 2020. Though, there was an audiotape by the leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau claiming the responsibility for the abduction, the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed said the abductors were bandits.\n\n\n\nThere were deployments of security operatives in search of the boys in the state and the neighbouring states. There was heavy criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari who was on an official annual leave in his hometown, Daura during the incident and did not visit the school or attend to the mourning and aggrieved parents of the boys at that time.\n\n\n\nOn December 17, Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari announced that 344 of the boys had been freed from where they were held captive in the forest in Zamfara State.\n\n\n\n\n\n27 Pupils abducted in Kagara, Niger in February 2021\n\n\n\nTwo months after Kankara boys regained freedom, gunmen stormed another Government Science College in Kagara, Niger State and abducted 27 schoolchildren.\n\nOne was killed in the attack.\n\n\n\nIn the attack that happened around 2:00am, three members of staff and their 12 relatives were also abducted by these armed criminals suspected to be bandits on 17th February, 2021.\n\n\n\nWhile the President asked the security agents to rescue them, the Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello said his government was negotiating with the bandits to release the victims.\n\n\n\nIt was on 27th February, that the government of Niger State announced the bandits had released all 42 hostages.\n\n\n\n\n\n279 schoolgirls abducted in Jangebe, Zamfara in February 2021\n\n\n\nIn similar versions of Chibok and Dapchi abductions, a group of armed bandits raided another Government Girls\u2019 Science Secondary School in Jangebe and whisked away 279 schoolgirls between the ages of 10 and 19 on 26th February, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe hostages, however, barely spent five days in the den of their abductors as all of them were released on March 2, after negotiation was reportedly brokered between the Zamfara Governor, Bello Matawale and the bandits.\n\n\n\n\n\n39 Students kidnapped in Afaka, Kaduna in March 2021\n\n\n\nThe gunmen upgraded their modus operandi by staging an abduction at a higher institution of learning, when they attacked the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka in Kaduna State and kidnapped 39 students. There were 16 males and 23 females taken as hostages in the attack that happened around 9:30pm that day.\n\n\n\nSources revealed that the victims would have been more than that had it not been that military men engaged the armed bandits in a gun battle, when a distress call was made to the Nigerian Army, as the college is located near the Nigerian Defence Academy military barracks.\n\n\n\nFive of them were released on April 5 and another five on April 10, as the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai reiterated that his administration would not negotiate with the gunmen to release the students.\n\n\n\nHowever, the remaining 29 students regained freedom when they were released on May 5, 2021, following a negotiation that was believed to have taken place as spearheaded by a controversial Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi and others.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity students, 2 staff members abducted in Kasarami, Kaduna in April 2021\n\n\n\nThe second kidnapping of tertiary students in Northern Nigeria occurred on April 20, 2021 when unknown gunmen invaded Greenfield University in Kasarami village, Kaduna State and abducted about 21 students and two members of staff of the institution.\n\n\n\nAfter taken hostages to their den, on April 23, the kidnappers killed 3 students and dumped their corpses at Kwanan Bature village, a location close to the university. Three days later, they killed two more students as they demanded N800 million as a ransom.\n\n\n\nMay 1 witnessed the release of one of the kidnapped students by the bandits after there were reports that his parents had paid an undisclosed amount of ransom.\n\n\n\nOn 29th May, 2021, the remaining 14 students and the workers regained freedom, following provision of N150 million and 8 new motorcycles as a ransom by their relatives to their abductors.\n\n\n\n\n\n200 Islamic students kidnapped in Tegina, Niger in May 2021\n\n\n\nThe latest abduction of schoolchildren was on Sunday 30, 2021 when armed militants suspected to be bandits invaded Salihu Tanko Islamic School in Rafi community, in Niger State.\n\n\n\nA video revealed how scores of people were running helter-skelter on the Tegina-Zugero highway in Niger State, during the assault.\n\n\n\nThe kidnappers on Tuesday contacted the school and demanded N110 million to release 156 students. They claimed were with them.\n\nThe state government has however said it will not pay any random to bandits.",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "For Rising Tide Africa, more African women should build diversified investment portfolios",
          "text": "Rising Tide Africa wants more women to be bolder at investment tables, to dream bigger and ask for more money to do bigger things. As told to me by Co- founder, Yemi Keri and Founding member, Ivana Osagie.\n\nWhen Ivana Osagie first started investing in startups, it was not entirely to make money for herself but out of a shared passion to help small businesses gain ground.\n\nThis meant that her investment efforts were without any knowledge of how things should work. So she did things without a proper framework, like weighing and diversifying her risks as well as evaluating her opportunities.\n\nBefore she could come to terms with this defect, the entrepreneur she invested with had disappeared with her money and she lost everything.\n\nWhile sulking over her loss, she stumbled upon angel investing and realised that it was what she needed to build her portfolio. Angels flock together for a reason,\u201d Osagie tells me on our Google call. \u201cBy investing alongside others, you get to diversify your risks to some extent, bringing certain expertise to the table. When you combine that with the expertise of other people, then you have a fuller picture of a startup.\u201d\n\nToday, Ivana is a founding member of Rising Tide Africa, an investment network that consists of a group of female angel investors harnessing their power, passion and capital to positively impact and actively create a new Africa.\n\nIvana Osagie: Founding member, Rising Tide Africa.\n\nWhat exactly does Rising Tide Africa do?\n\nFunded by private investors only, Rising Tide Africa was founded in 2016 by Co-founders Yemi Keri and Ndidi Nnoli- Edozien as a trans-border women-oriented investment network that engages in educating women to become angel investors. They do this through activities such as mentoring, networking and ultimately, offering opportunities for women to build a diversified portfolio of investments.\n\nRising Tide believes that it will bring about positive change by investing in the continent\u2019s exciting startups and next generation to create a new Africa.\n\nOsagie said that apart from investing money, they are also involved in other routines that aid the growth of the startups in their portfolio.\n\nWith every investing procedure comes other packages that involve mentoring and networking. She is of the opinion that investing isn\u2019t just about capitalism. \u201cWhen entrepreneurs come on board, we find that many times they\u2019re not investment-ready. So we need to work with them to get them investment-ready.\u201d\n\nThis process includes mentoring by industry experts and sharing a network of contacts.\n\nThis network of female investors has a mentoring team that works with founders to build business models, develop business plans and get a proper hold on the businesses. \u201cIt could be about helping them personally, for instance, learning how to communicate, how to stand in front of investors and convince them of the viability of the solution,\u201d she tells me.\n\nMuch talk about women empowerment\n\nAlthough the VC firm invests in female lead and gender diverse teams predominantly, there is a reason for this.\n\nIn the last decade, Africa has seen a massive explosion in the business sector, especially for tech-enabled startups. Early-stage companies and SMEs now exist in an exciting technology economy that is fast sprouting a lot of opportunities for business owners on the continent. But in all of these, there is still a limited opportunity pipeline for women.\n\nWhen it comes to access to finance, amongst other things, reports still prove that women aren\u2019t participating as much.\n\nGlobally, women\u2019s access to finance is disproportionately low. In 2017, according to this report, 65% of women had a financial account compared with 72% of men. Fast forward to 2021, not much has changed. In trying to determine what could still be the reason behind this, according to a World Bank report, the gap between men and women in developing economies remains unchanged since 2011, at 9 percentage points.\n\nOnly 37% of women have a bank account in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2017, compared with 48% of men with bank accounts.\n\nThe African Development Bank revealed that there is a $42 billion gender gap in access to finance. In Nigeria, for example, an estimated 50% of the population lives in extreme poverty and financial exclusion for women is only 36%. In bridging this gap, more organisations and startups are leaning towards gender balance in their operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not really a pretty sight, is it?\n\nThese reasons and more formed the foundation of Rising Tide Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to paint a different landscape. We wanted women to come to the table, to be bolder, to dream bigger dreams, and to ask for more money to do bigger things because we know that women have the capacity to do so. We might just need a bit of support. So that\u2019s why we set about building an angel network that comprises women so that we can open up space for more women,\u201d Ivana says.\n\nShe believes that by giving women agency, \u201cwe\u2019re actually building a bigger and stronger community and ensuring better outcomes for everybody; men, women and children inclusive.\n\nInvestment opportunity pipeline for startups\n\nApart from investing solely in female-led companies, Rising Tide looks out for all kinds of tech-enabled startups.

          "title": "How Uche Ogboi became CEO of Lori Systems and her billion-dollar mission for African logistics",
          "text": "As CEO of Lori Systems, Uche Ogboi will bear some of the weight of African logistics on her shoulders.\n\nWhen Lori Systems started operations in Kenya in 2016, Uche Ogboi was nearing the end of an eventful eight-year career as an investment banker at Citi.\n\nShe had led the multinational bank\u2019s fund for small businesses and helped deploy billions of dollars for projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.\n\nA year later, Lori would be the star startup at TechCrunch\u2019s first-ever Battlefield Africa competition, winning $25,000. One of the judges at the event was Eghosa Omoigui, the founding partner at EchoVC Partners, a Nigerian venture capital firm. Ogboi had joined EchoVC as an associate principal, closing deals and helping the firm\u2019s portfolio companies figure out operations.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, first met Ogboi in 2017. When they met again in 2019, Ogboi was now principal at EchoVC and led the VC firm\u2019s investment in Lori\u2019s Series A round.\n\nHer due diligence process impressed Sandler who was looking out for someone to bring structure and help scale the logistics startup\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cShe was so incredibly structured and process-driven,\u201d Sandler says to TechCabal in a joint interview with Ogboi.\n\n\u201cShe understood what we were doing and pushed us in new directions. Lori needed her.\u201d\n\nJoining Lori and multitasking\n\nOgboi joined Lori as Chief Operations Officer (COO) in July 2019, four months before the Series A raise was announced. But in her first few months at Lori, Ogboi had to do more than be COO to immerse herself in the thorny business of logistics in Africa.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t functionally do the role until over a year in. I started by experiencing almost every role in the business because that was needed,\u201d she says.\n\nUche Ogboi. Image credit: Lori Systems.\n\nShe was on the field managing cargo departures and overseeing transportation. For a time, she filled in as the startup\u2019s chief financial officer and general manager for their operations in East and West Africa.\n\n\u201cThat experience has allowed me to work very closely and empathize with every part of the team, as well as with customers and transporters. I have seen the business from all sides.\u201d\n\nThis boots-on-the-ground experience of the business helped her understand logistics pain points. It clarified how technology will ultimately drive solutions that relieve those pains.\n\n\u201cFor our investors and stakeholders, I know and understand what it takes to scale Lori to become a multi-billion-dollar company on the continent.\u201d\n\nDeploying to Nigeria and saving costs\n\nOne of Lori\u2019s goals is to help clients save cost by up to 20%. While they have historically achieved that, Sandler credits Ogboi for some transformations that have happened since 2019.\n\nUntil Ogboi joined, the startup was largely an East African company in two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Mombasa) and Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Sandler ran the company with Jean-Claude Homawoo, as co-founder and chief product officer.\n\nAs part of her first task, Ogboi scaled Lori\u2019s official expansion to Nigeria in the second half of that year. In doing so, she increased competition in Nigeria\u2019s tech-enabled logistics sector which already included startups like Kobo360 and TradeDepot.\n\nAccording to Sandler, she grew the Nigerian business tenfold within that first year. In 2020, she kept the entire organisation lean when COVID-19 disrupted regular flow at borders, helping the company save 40% of costs and nearly doubling margins.\n\nBy mid-2020, Ogboi\u2019s actions in shaping Lori\u2019s adjustment to the pandemic led Sandler to have deeper thoughts about the startup\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw Uche in action, it became even more clear that as Lori continues to grow, she should be the person at the helm of this organisation,\u201d Sandler says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a quick decision but by December, conversations became more serious, setting a succession plan in motion that would lead to her appointment as CEO, with effect from July 1, 2021.\n\nA rare CEO leading an African first-mover\n\nSandler, a South African, will become Lori\u2019s Executive Chairman while Ogboi takes the wheel as the startup\u2019s visionary.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, will become Executive Chairman\n\nShe hopes to lean into her ten-year \u201ccocktail of experiences\u201d from investment banking through venture capital to drive Lori\u2019s mission of being the platform that makes every node in the logistics value chain efficient, thereby lowering haulage costs in Africa.\n\nSome factors like poor road infrastructure and policy inconsistencies will be out of her control.\n\nAs of 2018, the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index ranked Kenya 68th, Uganda 102nd and Nigeria 110th out of 160 countries.\n\nBut Ogboi\u2019s main anchor for changing the space \u2013 the focus of her leadership at Lori \u2013 will be further exploring the power of digital technology for logistics. At the moment, Lori provides clients with real-time information on goods and trucking assets through web-based apps.\n\nSo what\u2019s next on their technology roadmap: Internet of Things? Augmented Reality for warehousing? Blockchain for trucking?\n\nLogistics-tech companies like Lori may not solve Lagos traffic or build roads in Kampala. But they hope to exert influence through technology.\n\nOgboi does not give specifics. But she says they are working on some things over the next few months that will help them \u201cscale much quicker.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, it should be inevitable that someone as experienced should lead a mission as big. In reality, Ogboi is one of only a handful of female tech CEOs in Africa. She takes a deep breath and acknowledges the sad reality but knows she is in a position to drive more women up the ladder in other tech startups but especially at Lori.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has recovered from 2020\u2019s shock. It is back to its pre-COVID growth rates of 20% month over month. Last November, they received an undisclosed investment and signed a partnership agreement with Imperial Logistics, a global logistics company.\n\nSandler is confident that Ogboi will increase Lori\u2019s partnerships and relationships. Under his leadership, Lori helped move cargo worth billions of dollars; he looks forward to trillions with Ogboi in charge.\n\nNo pressure, huh?\n\nFor the new CEO \u2013 a mother of two daughters \u2013 it has been tradition to wake in the middle of the night to think about Lori. Now she\u2019ll probably sleep even less with the weight of African logistics on her shoulders. I prod and poke for what her first announcement will be. Convivial but coy, she only volunteers a general sign: \u201cwatch this space.\u201d",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "Nourishing dairy with tech, a path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth?",
          "text": "Milk\u2019s nutritional value compares favourably to its economic value. According to Agrilinks, milk is a commodity in high demand in Nigeria, with over a billion tons needed annually. Unfortunately, several factors impede Nigeria\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for dairy products.\n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations says, \u201cA healthy productive population is increasingly recognized not only as resulting from but also as an important prerequisite for poverty reduction and economic and social development.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, the FAO declared June 1 World Milk Day to highlight the importance of milk and draw attention to the global dairy sector.\n\nSadly, two decades later, Nigeria\u2019s milk production pales in comparison to its potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) reports that pastoral systems, which yield meagre output, produce 90% of Nigeria\u2019s milk.\n\nConsequently, the country relies heavily on imported milk. According to a Vanguard article, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) estimates that $1.5 billion is spent on milk importation annually.\n\nDeveloped countries have employed scientific and technological innovations in the dairy sector. The US, for instance, is the second-largest producer of milk globally per the FAO. And according to Statista, it made $40.4 billion from milk in 2020.\n\nThe dairy industry\u2019s success in developed countries is mainly due to adopting technologies that make larger herds profitable. These technologies, as the FAO puts it, \u201crequire large capital investments.\u201d From milking to preserving to distribution, the role of technology in the dairy sector cannot be overemphasised.\n\nThe quest for indigenous milk\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe demand for milk in Nigeria is an opportunity to generate revenue internally. Besides the imperfect production process, Data by AsokoInsights reveals that the country has 20 million cows \u2014 the fourth-largest herd in Africa \u2014 but only 11.5% are used for milk. In contrast, 88.5% go towards producing beef.\n\nResearch by SpringerLink highlights reasons for Nigeria, and by extension, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s failing dairy sector. Subsistence-oriented modes of production and the genetic make-up of indigenous cows are some of many.\n\nAccording to AsokoInsights, Nigerian cows can only produce between one and a half to two litres of milk daily. A cow in Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s largest producers of dairy products, produces 30 litres of milk daily.\n\nCorroborating AsokoInsights submission, research by the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, shows that only two African countries \u2014 Ethiopia and Kenya \u2014 are self-sufficient in milk production. For context, Africa has five times the number of dairy cows in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can infer from Dairy Australia\u2019s account of the milk-making process that, unlike most parts of Africa, dairy production is more technology-driven in developed countries like the US and New Zealand.\n\nFor example, cows are milked using vacuum cups attached to their teats. The milk is then sent to large steel vats and stored at five degrees for two days. It is then pasteurised, increasing shelf-life.\n\nWhile the genetic nature of Nigerian cows cannot be overlooked, the predominantly manual production process poses a major obstacle to a sustainable dairy sector.\n\nMilking Nigeria\u2019s potential\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe Nigerian Dairy Development Program, NDDP, started in 2019 in partnership with Sahel Consulting Agriculture and Nutrition Limited, was designed to help address the local dairy sector\u2019s problems.\n\nAccording to Agrilinks, some local producers who benefited from the programme recorded a 198% increase in milk sales. While this proves the viability of the dairy sector, more still needs to be done.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria, per Nairametrics, released a circular in March 2020 restricting the importation of milk. However, the restriction didn\u2019t affect six companies: FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria, Chi Limited, TG Arla Dairy Products Limited, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc., and Integrated Dairies Limited.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s restriction is a way of enabling backward integration in the dairy sector. Ekiti State\u2019s Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Akin Oyebode, explains why the CBN\u2019s directive might not work and what Ekiti State is doing differently.\n\nIn a tweet on April 22, 2021, Oyebode announced the arrival of 250 Jersey cows in Nigeria to be delivered to Ikun Dairy Farm, Ekiti State. This was a sequel to a joint venture between Promasidor Group, a food and beverage company, and the state government.\n\nGot 41 of c. 250 heifers in today, due to their weight (mostly pregnant) and available cargo space. Hope to get the other 200+ in very soon. Another tiny milestone hit. pic.twitter.com/rWzequMybQ \u2014 Akin Oyebode (@AO1379) February 9, 2021\n\nOyebode tells Techpoint Africa that Promasidor was a strategic choice by the state government. Unlike some of the other companies restricted by the CBN, Promasidor is not from a milk-producing country. According to him, companies in milk-producing countries would be hesitant to develop Nigeria\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nThe strategic joint venture is leading to the gradual revitalisation of the Ikun Dairy Farm (IDF).\n\nOyebode identifies low-yield cows as one of the sector\u2019s challenges, hence the importation of Jersey cows. According to him, 40 indigenous cows in the IDF produce 60 litres of milk a day, while six Jersey cows produce 150 litres a day.\n\n\u201cThe cow variant in Nigeria has been really focused on beef, and we generally do a lot of open grazing over long distances. Over the years, the genes of our cows won\u2019t give us the kind of milk that we require,\u201d Oyebode says.\n\nHe adds that it will take a long period for Nigeria to regain the milk-generating capabilities of its cows through cross-breeding.\n\nOyebode admits that while factors like science and technology go into building a sustainable dairy farm, they will be futile if the cow yield isn\u2019t proportional to the infrastructural inputs.\n\nHowever, Alhaji Muhammadu Damakka Abubakar, Executive Director and owner of L & Z Integrated Farms Nigeria Limited, a dairy company established over 15 years ago, believes low-yield cows are not a major problem for the country\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nHe cites India, the largest producer of milk globally, as an example.\n\n\u201cAverage milk per cow in India is not up to ten litres, but they have plenty, so if you have low-yielding cows but in large numbers, it makes up for their low yield.\u201d\n\nAbubakar believes the problem isn\u2019t the low-yield cows but the technology used in the milk collection process. Also, rather than open grazing, he suggests ranching as an alternative.\n\n\u201cThe era of allowing cows to roam is gone,\u201d Abubakar says.\n\nWith 20 million cows milked optimally \u2014 using a technologically-based milking system \u2014 in the right conditions with the right tools, he maintains that Nigeria will produce enough milk to meet the demand.\n\nWhile increasing cow yield can be looked into in the long run, Abubakar says using the indigenous cows optimally should be prioritised.\n\nSpeaking on the dairy sector\u2019s viability, he says, \u201cFrom milk, you can derive over 100 components; and from oil, you have only 20 or 25. A barrel of milk is worth almost 100 times what a barrel of crude oil is worth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a barrel of crude oil is currently worth $67 while its equivalent in milk is worth $57. In terms of daily demand, more crude oil is consumed. Knoema, a data technology company, puts Nigeria\u2019s daily crude oil consumption at 522,000 barrels \u2014 82.9 million litres \u2014 in March 2021.\n\nThese numbers exceed the demand for milk greatly. Per LEADERSHIP, the yearly demand for milk is 1.6 billion litres, putting the daily demand at 4.4 million litres.\n\nWhile these numbers nullify Abubakar claims, they do not reduce the viability of the dairy sector as a major source of revenue.",

This is Africa\u2019s first senior engineer incubator programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? According to a Google IFC report, Africa has nearly 700,000 software developers, most of whom are junior developers.\n\nOutside Africa, there is a huge demand for senior engineers. TalentQL CEO, Adewale Yusuf (pictured above, first from left) reveals that as much as 90% of their clients are seeking senior engineers.\n\nYou might remember that Andela changed its business model from a talent accelerator to a talent outsourcing company, citing the need for more senior developers as the reason for this move.\n\nSimilar to Lambda\u2019s pay-later model, participants are not required to pay for the six-month-long programme until they\u2019ve found their next opportunity.\n\nThe programme would be entirely remote and would teach not only tech skills but also soft skills which these engineers would need in their roles.\n\nRead this article by our reporter, Ogheneruemu, to get more insights about the programme.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app ambitions\n\nImage credit: Gokada\n\nGokada is set to merge its food delivery and logistics services into a single service as it moves towards its super app plans.\n\nDespite the effects of the pandemic and the ride-hailing ban by the Lagos State Government, the startup has enjoyed significant success, with the company\u2019s revenue reportedly increasing by ten times in the last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2018 as a ride-hailing startup, a ban on ride-hailing operations by the Lagos State Government meant it had to change its focus. The result was a food delivery service (GShop) and logistics service (GSend)\n\nWatch out, Safeboda! As part of these plans, the startup plans to launch in other Nigerian cities, starting with neighbouring markets, Ogun and Ibadan.\n\nWhat does this mean? Departing from the norm, Ugandan ride-hailing startup, Safeboda, launched its services in Ibadan. While it has enjoyed a market monopoly, Gokada\u2019s planned move would present the young startup with its first taste of competition.\n\nThis article sheds more light on this move.\n\nOnyeka Akumah steps down as CEO of Farmcrowdy\n\nFrom L -R Onyeka Akumah (Former CEO, Farmcrowdy) and Akindele Phillips (CEO Farmcrowdy).

          "text": "Nigeria is reeling from the effect of the SIM registration ban, as mobile subscribers have dropped drastically in just four months.\n\nPooling data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Intelligence by Techpoint reveals that Nigeria lost 15.5 million subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nIn December 2020, the Minister of Communications & Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, through the NCC, suspended the registration of SIM cards by network operators in Nigeria. Here's a look at how the suspension affected the country's mobile subscriptions. pic.twitter.com/TdPYGSNAgM \u2014 Intelligence by Techpoint (@TechpointIntel) June 1, 2021\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria had 190 million mobile subscribers, but that number hit 192 million in March 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian government banned the sale and registration of new SIM cards and introduced a December 30 deadline for people to link their National Identity Number (NIN) with their SIM cards.\n\nIn retrospect, it is not clear if the government considered the risks of COVID-19, as that move coincided with a sharp increase in positive cases in the following months.\n\nMTN and Airtel\u2019s financial reports for Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 revealed that this policy would also hurt telecom companies. Both companies registered a reduction in subscriber numbers during the period in question.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s data all but confirms these numbers.\n\nIn November 2020, Nigeria had up to 207.9 mobile subscribers, but the country has witnessed a downward spiral since then, leading to the loss of over 15 million subscribers.\n\nCompared to previous years, this could be considered an abysmal showing.\n\nBy comparison, Nigeria gained 15.7 million subscribers between March 2019 and March 2020. From March 2018 to 2019, subscribers grew by a whopping 23 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NCC\u2019s subscriber numbers could perhaps be termed inflated, considering the data doesn\u2019t account for people holding multiple SIMs in different devices.\n\nConsequently, the actual number of mobile subscribers is much lower than what the NCC\u2019s records show. Though the regulator had plans to regularise the data in the past, nothing much came of them until the NIN order.\n\nThe subscriber decline in such a short time continues to raise questions about the size of Nigeria\u2019s addressable Internet market, as most of the lost subscribers are Internet users.\n\nPer the NCC, Nigeria lost 9.2 million Internet subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nWhile the data wars of 2019 and 2020 were particularly thrilling to observe, Nigerian telecom companies were on a losing streak in the three months between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nMTN was the hardest hit, with 3.8 million Internet subscribers lost. For context, MTN lost 4.8 million subscribers in total. This means about 70% of them were Internet subscribers.\n\nHistorically a formidable competitor to MTN in the data market, Airtel lost about 3.5 million Internet users. This is about 67% of the subscribers it lost in total.\n\nGlo fared way better than the first two, losing 1.3 million Internet subscribers, about 68% of the total mobile users it lost.\n\nSIM ban or not, 9mobile has struggled with the loss of its subscribers in recent years. However, it lost the least number of Internet subscribers at a respectable 701k.\n\nHowever, this number gets weird considering that it lost just 132k mobile subscribers. This would mean about 569 9mobile subscribers went offline during this period.\n\nThe loss of Internet subscribers by Nigerian telcos is also telling considering that, due to the pandemic, more people needed to be online to attend to their businesses, jobs, or education, but the SIM ban period might have been a stumbling block.\n\nThankfully, the ban has been lifted even though the NIN registrations continue.",

          "title": "Competition drives local airlines to put market before cost",
          "text": "As competition intensifies in Nigeria\u2019s domestic aviation industry, some airlines are left with little or no choice to survive by charging below their operating cost, as they focus on retaining or gaining better market share.\n\nNigeria\u2019s aviation industry has been experiencing a flurry of activities, with new airlines coming up, and 25 prospective operators in the process of marking their presence in the skies.\n\nNew entrants are adopting strategies such as low fares, comfort and timeliness to attract the market, as operating cost become secondary, at least at these early stages.\n\nFor instance, Green Africa, a prospective airline, announced fares between N16,500 and N23,000, which is about a 50 to 70 percent slash in fares charged by other airlines.\n\nExperts say these prices are below operating cost, considering the high exchange rate, depleting fleet size, high cost of aviation fuel, labour cost and multiple taxations airlines have to pay.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that before the current challenge of depleting aircraft fleet and high foreign exchange rate, airlines charged between N23,000 and N30,000 for a one-way trip from Lagos to Abuja, Lagos to Port Harcourt or Lagos to Owerri.\n\nExperts say at these rates, airlines are not realising their operating costs.\n\nFor instance, it cost about $3,000 to operate a Boeing 737 aircraft on a one hour flight when aviation fuel was less than N100 per litre.\n\nFurther checks show that with the current exchange rate and increase in aviation fuel, which currently cost about N220 per litre, airlines operate a B737 aircraft at a cost of about $6,000.\n\nAverage fuel consumption on a Lagos to Abuja flight takes nothing less than 8,000 litres and at N220/litre, airlines would be paying N1.76 million for fuel alone; that is if the airline does not have to divert flight for weather or technical reasons.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa disrupts airline business with cheap airfares\n\nWith the current exchange rate of N500 to a dollar, it would cost airlines N3 million to operate a B737 aircraft. This means, for airlines to realise cost of operations on a B737 aircraft carrying an average of 100 passengers, the airline would have to charge an average of N30,000 for each passenger on a one-way flight.\n\nIf airlines hope to make some profit from their operations, then a one-way ticket on an hour flight should cost between N35,000 and N45,000.\n\nDaniel Young, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that disruptive market entry could work in other sectors, not aviation except there were under-the-table funding of the airline business.\n\nConsidering the Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM) based on cost of Available Seat Miles (ASM) against current Cost per Available Seat Mile (CASM), this ticket pricing by Green Africa is a mathematical impossibility, Young said.\n\nEven if the airline does not make profit, it should at least be able to cover operating expenses, he noted.\n\nAccording to Young, as new airlines spring up and they introduce promotional fares, cutting cost might help stimulate demand but may likely generate an elastic demand for seats way beyond the capacity and capabilities of the new airline; leading to service failures and disappointments.\n\nThe checks show further that aviation fuel takes 32 percent of operating cost, labour 17 percent, aircraft rent and ownership 8.5 percent, non-aircraft rents and ownership 7 percent, professional services 4.5 percent, landing fees 3 percent, food and beverage 1.5 percent, maintenance materials 13 percent, transport-related 1.5 percent, and others 12 percent.\n\nObi Mbanuzuo, chief operating officer/accountable manager at Dana Air, told BusinessDay that airlines fix prices of tickets after considering variables such as cost of operation, level of competition, each individual airline\u2019s strategy and how much the market can pay.\n\nFor cost of operations, he said airlines fix prices with considerations on whether the aircraft is wet or dry leased, or owned by the operating airline.\n\n\u201cEach aircraft model has differing maintenance costs based on manufacturers\u2019 intervals for heavy or C/D checks. Newer aircraft are more reliable and break down less often than older ones, and also have longer maintenance intervals (up to 48 months for B737 Max compared to 18 months for older B737s ) so the maintenance cost is usually lower,\u201d Mbanuzuo said.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), told BusinessDay that operational cost determines ticketing price.\n\nThe operational cost components, he said, include fuel consumption for the duration of the flight, which in itself depends on the engine type or numbers of (one or multiple) propellers, turbo or jet; air navigation and control en-route, terminal services like toilet and other airport convenient and safety services such as the runway landings, lightings and approach aids services; ground handling services, catering services, etc.\n\n\u201cFirst, operating B737, a medium-range aircraft with less than 70 percent load capacity for mostly short-range flights or distances of Lagos/Abuja, Lagos/PH, Lagos/Enugu, etc, makes no economic sense.\n\n\u201cNigeria Airways in its days would fly F27/F28. That is why it makes sense seeing some of the airlines reverting to aircraft like Embraers now. The air navigation services charges vary with flight conditions (VFR or IFR) and the navigational support,\u201d Ojikutu explained.\n\nHe said ground services charges too depend on aircraft type or size, as operators cannot operate an Embraer at the same cost as they would a B737.\n\nAirfare is a product, but it has far more pricing variables than most. Airline ticket prices can and sometimes change every day.\n\nFor Tolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, factors that influence pricing of airfare include aviation fuel, flight distance, competition, timing of purchase, timing of flight, passenger appetite and empty middle seat.\n\nOn competition, Odutola said the more airlines, the merrier for passengers. \u201cFierce competition means lower ticket prices,\u201d he said",

          "text": "Nigeria can productively engage about 60 percent of its under-utilized pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and cut importation of pharmaceutical products by at least 25 percent with the adoption of contract manufacturing (outsourcing), industry analysts and stakeholders have said, making a case for growth.\n\nContract manufacturing is one of the strategies emerging market peers have adopted to own a significant share of global pharmaceutical production, by servicing the rising need for outsourcing different aspects of production.\n\nChina, India, Singapore, South Korea, and even Malaysia have become an attractive hub for giant pharmaceutical firms looking to have others manage the business of up-scaling their backend for large volumes of production and stay price competitive.\n\nThis played a significant part in placing Asian manufacturers as the second-leading exporter of drugs and medicines in 2019 with 9.5 percent of the global total, despite European countries controlling over 80 percent.\n\nRead Also: Customs seizes fake drugs, recovers N426m from importers at Lagos Ports\n\nTaking on these roles has given these manufacturers an edge in a highly contested marketplace such that India, for instance, now answers as the largest producer of vaccines in the world.\n\nAnalysts think the contracting manufacturing strategies hold huge growth potential for Nigeria to make a bold statement on the world map, considering the opportunities inherent in collaborations with corporations of repute for quality standards.\n\nAs of 2017, Nigeria\u2019s drug manufacturing industry only catered to a quarter of the local demand, with the remaining three quarters handled by Asian manufacturers\u2019 exports to Nigeria.\n\nThis implies as much as 70 percent of marketed drugs by about 130 pharmaceutical firms were imported.\n\nIt is a growing concern that the Nigerian Representatives of Overseas Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (NIROPHARM) say the country may not be rid of it and shies away from opportunities such as contract manufacturing.\n\nThe group in a position report provided to BusinessDay stated that some of the goals outlined in the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan to make Nigeria a top hub in West Africa and an ideal supplier of low and medium technology consumer and industrial goods could materialise with the contracting approach in a pharmaceutical market expected to worth $4 billion by 2026, according to McKinsey\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is that instead of banning the importation, why don\u2019t you allow these local companies that have the capacity to work with the international firms raise their standards, and with that take on the volume that is being imported,\u201d Femi Soremekun, president NIROPHARM\n\nDifferent from regular manufacturing companies that are neck-deep in all operations of production, contract manufacturing organisations are based on the client\u2019s specific designs, formulas and specifications.\n\nWhile some clients request for active ingredient manufacturing, for example, others simply want solid dosage produced to their specifications.\n\nSome of the drivers of growth in Nigeria currently include demand for generic compositions to reduce the rising cost of healthcare increased collaborations with pharmaceutical firms overseas, availability of production facilities, and regional trade integration across Africa.\n\nNIROPHARM sees this as a growth area that the government can pursue strongly to position Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector better on the continent.\n\nCountries across Africa are bending towards generic drugs, which have sustained double-digit market share at the expense of over-the-counter and branded products.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have higher capacity utilization; your cost of manufacturing will drop and make the product. If a Fidson is trying to compete for export of a drug within the AfCFTA to Senegal, the average doctor will still want to buy a GSK product for trust. But if you present a product that is in partnership with GSK, the trust will extend to this product and position Nigeria better,\u201d Ehighebolo said.",

The virus has changed the way we live and interact with one another globally.\n\n\u201cIt is heartwarming today that we continue with our gradual return to our normal lives with the commencement of the second dose coronavirus vaccination. With this, we hope for brighter days ahead as we collectively fight to defeat the virus.\n\n\u201cThe second dose vaccination exercise commences today, June 1, and will last for 40 days, during which period we intend to get the vaccines to our people, including frontline workers who are 18 years and above across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the State.\n\nObaseki said the second dose is a booster dose which will provide full protection against the coronavirus disease, adding: \u201cThe flag off is important to create awareness in the state and boost public confidence in the safety and efficiency of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI took the first dose. Despite all the fears expressed, nothing happened. I am here today to flag off the second dose vaccination. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t take my second dose today because the time scheduled for me is not due. I will be due for the second dose on the 12th of June. However, some people have earlier dates. That is why the programme is launched today. I will take my second dose on the 12th of June and you will be invited to know the importance of the vaccination.\u201d\n\nNoting that the vaccines will be rolled out in phases, he said: \u201cThe first phase is now being administered to frontline workers, strategic leaders and the elderly; as scheduled for them. The second and third phase will follow and the rest of the eligible population will take turns to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the goal of his administration is to vaccinate about 70 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not been vaccinated, it is important to take the vaccine because by the end of June, it might be almost impossible to travel around the world without a vaccination certificate.\n\n\u201cGovernment alone can\u2019t fix this pandemic. We must all play our part by adhering to COVID 19 protocol to enable us to protect our loved ones, even after taking the second dose of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki seized the opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his support and role played in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that different stakeholders, particularly development partners, worked in synergy with the Edo State Government in ridding the state of the virus.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have vaccinated 38,500 people in the first phase of the first dose vaccination exercise. We are expecting that 38,500 people will come forward for their second dose. It is only then that you will have full immunization.\u201d\n\n...",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev. Fr. Arhedo consequently admonished parents to discipline their children thoughtfully, teach children their rights, invest in kids and implored people to endeavour to report any case of child abuse to relevant agencies for prosecution.\n\nSpeaking on the the theme of the 2021 Child Protection Day, \u201cThe Role of Parents and Caregivers in the Protection of Children, the Coordinator of the Edo State Child Protection Network, Barr.

Its revenue for the period stood at N109.59 billion in 2020.\n\nThe reduction in the firm\u2019s selling and distribution expenses during the period translated into a 39.1% increase in its operating profit from N5.5 billion in 2019 to N7.65 billion.\n\nThe company, however, spent a sum of N4.59 billion as employee cost, indicating a 12% increase compared to N4.1 billion recorded in the previous period, while also increasing its staff strength from 819 as of 2019 to 832 at the end of 2020.\n\nA cursory look at the report, reveals that the entire revenue was generated from sales of goods within Nigeria, with none received outside the shores of the country. Notably, the company\u2019s business operating segments are identified by three factories, with the Apapa factory generating the highest revenue of N85.02 billion in 2020.\n\nThe Sagamu plant followed with total revenue of N19.1 billion, accounting for 17.4% of the total revenue, while Ikeja generated N5.49 billion for the company.\n\nCommenting on the results, Lanre Jaiyeola, the Managing Director of Honeywell Flour Mills, Plc., said: \u201cIn an extremely challenging year caused by unprecedented global disruptions and uncertainties, we achieved 36% revenue growth and record-breaking success through sheer grit and doggedness of our workforce.\n\n\u201cWe worked collaboratively towards the execution of our goals; improved production and cost optimisation, guided by a clear strategy and common purpose.\u201d\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring the supply of affordable nutritious food products to Nigerians, and we continue to assure our shareholders of long-term profitable returns from Honeywell Flour Mills Plc,\u201d he added.\n\nHoneywell Flour Mills Plc is a leading food company producing, marketing, and selling food products in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) space in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the company, the future of its business would be shaped by continued investment in innovative product development, advanced technology infrastructure, and operational efficiency.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has solicited the support of the Ministry of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the realisation of landed properties of banks in-liquidation within the FCT to enable it pay depositors of affected closed banks.\n\nThe Chairman of the NDIC Board of Directors, Mrs Ronke Sokefun said this during a courtesy visit by the Corporation\u2019s Board and Management to the Honourable Minister of the FCT, Mal. Mohammed Musa Bello in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Mrs Sokefun, the Corporation had faced some bottlenecks in the full payment of trapped depositors\u2019 funds as a result of difficulty in realising assets of banks in-liquidation due to poor documentation by the banks, revocation of title by authorities and litigations over the assets. The NDIC Board Chairman who noted that some of the assets were located within the FCT said the support of the Ministry in realising them would assist the Corporation in the effective discharge of its mandate of deposit guarantee which ensures that depositors recover their savings in the event of bank failure.\n\nSpeaking further, NDIC\u2019s Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Bello Hassan elaborated on the roles and relationship between the NDIC and the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) in the management of banks assets. He explained that the NDIC as a liquidator focuses on the assets of closed banks following revocation of their licence by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) while AMCON was involved with only Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) of existing banks acquired by AMCON.\n\nResponding, Minister of FCT, Mal. Mohammed Musa Bello observed that problems relating to landed properties in the FCT were usually not by the Ministry but from issues arising from the title of such properties. He however said the Ministry was amenable to assisting the Corporation in resolving issues around its properties and those of banks in-liquidation in the FCT within the ambit of the law.\n\nMal. Bello noted the continued long standing and cordial relationship that has been sustained over the years between the Corporation and the Ministry. He commended the Corporation for its active support of the development in the FCT in education through the donation of furniture and books as well as the Corporation\u2019s interventions and financial assistance in support of the fight against the COVID-19 Pandemic.",

          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has stated that most of the challenges encountered by applicants during the registration for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE), were due to the applicants\u2019 failure to follow instructions.\n\nThe Board stated that candidates were responsible for over 80% of the registration hitches.\n\nThe registrar of the Board, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, stated this on Wednesday, during a monitoring exercise for some prospective candidates, who were unable to register for the exam during the registration window, which closed on May 29, 2021.\n\nThe monitoring exercise, which allows prospective candidates to fill and submit a form on the challenge(s) that prevented them from registering for the exam before now, was to enable the exam body to clear those with genuine cases for this year\u2019s exam after following the required registration processes.\n\nBut a visit to some of the centres in Kogo, Bwari and Garki 2, Abuja, which are playing host to the exercise in the Federal Capital Territory, revealed that almost all the students that blamed JAMB\u2019s system for the challenges they encountered were actually the architects of their own registration challenges.\n\nWhile the affected prospective candidates had blamed their challenges on their inability to secure e-pin or generate profile code on time, findings revealed that almost all of those interviewed failed to follow stipulated registration procedures as announced by the exam body.\n\nA candidate, Emmanuel Ojo, who admitted to his mistake, when a JAMB official accessed his information on the exam body\u2019s system, to unravel why he was having issues generating a PIN, said he only sent his National Identification Number without indicating NIN on it while another said he erroneously added double space when sending his personal details to the registration code.\n\nHafsat Ahmed, a prospective DE candidate, said she tried severally to generate an e-PIN but didn\u2019t succeed on time, but an official of JAMB also proved to her that the fault was from her.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI have been trying to get the profile code but it was not coming, when I finally got it on May 27, 2021, I was told that the e-PIN was not available,\u201d she said.\n\nFor his part, a would-be UTME candidate, Abraham Williams, said he also tried severally to get the profile code, admitting that he was probably not following the required format.\n\nIt was observed that the issue that led to the registration difficulties faced by many of the prospective candidates that trooped out for the exercise were mainly due to use of double spacing in sending messages for profile code generation, name not matched with the one on NIMC database, phone number already used by another candidate, insufficient balance to generate profile code that cost only N50, among others.\n\nReacting to the development, Prof. Oloyede expressed concern that many of the candidates failed to follow simple instructions on registration process as put in place by the Board, adding that over 80 per cent of the challenges encountered were self-inflicted by the applicants.\n\n\u201cMany of them were sending wrong things and commands for NIN, making NIMC unable to verify such numbers.\n\nThe problems are self-created by the candidates, you are sending messages for a profile code and no credit of N50,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "By Ukpono Ukpong\n\nIn a bid to ensure rapid response to distressed calls, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has commissioned 20 new Basic Life Support ambulance buses and seven state-of-the-art firefighting trucks for use by the Federal Fire Service (FFS).\n\nAccording to the Minister, the equipment are part of the N10.4 billion infrastructure upgrade approved by the Federal Executive Council on March 3, comprising of 44 firefighting engines, 15 water tankers, 15 rapid intervention fire engines (not conventional ones) that can go into any nook and cranny to respond to distressed calls and 20 basic life support ambulances.\n\nIn his address during the commissioning and the pulling out of Senior officers of the service, Aregbesola explained that the ambulances are an innovation to firefighting, as it has become obvious that para-medical services are an adjunct of disaster and emergency management.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the intervention would help to provide emergency medical services to the needy and evacuate victims to the nearest medical facility in real time.\n\nREAD ALSO: Adamu Garba: Nnamdi Kanu is bent on burning small Biafra\n\n\u201cIt is heart rending to see the wounded and other victims of fire disasters and other emergencies with varying degrees of burns and injuries lying on the floor, waiting for evacuation to hospitals and many die helplessly in the process. This intervention should address this challenge and save lives.\n\n\u201cIn March, I approved the training of 21 fire-fighting officers in the University of Civil Defence and Emergency Studies, Minsk, Belarus, among other agreements with the country. These officers will be the master trainers that will be training other officers locally on modern firefighting, disaster and emergency management.\n\n\u201cI must thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his continued support for the Ministry of Interior and her agencies. It pleases me to state that the delivery of these new Basic Life Support ambulance buses and fire trucks is indeed a further testimony of his resolve to reposition the FFS for better service delivery in line with it\u2019s core mandate, which include humanitarian and emergency services.\u201d\n\nHe said that since the inception of the present administration, FFS has experienced a phenomenal transformation from a moribund department to a vibrant organisation equipped with modern and state of the art firefighting equipment be manned by well trained, dedicated and committed personnel.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of these new ambulance buses and trucks and their deployment to the various Zonal and state Commands would surely enhance service delivery of the Federal Fire Service during emergencies.\n\n\u201cI will therefore urge the Zonal and State Commands where these vehicles would be deployed to reciprocate the Federal Government\u2019s gesture, to optimize and effectively use these assets to improve fire cover, enhance emergency response operations, and complement State Fire Services operations while enhancing fire safety across the country.\n\n\u201cI have directed the Service to re-engage the manufacturers of these vehicles on their maintenance and also to train young Mechanical and Electrical Engineers/ Technicians that will in future be saddled with the responsibility of maintaining the vehicles.\n\nSpeaking further, he also congratulated the gallant officers pulling out of the Service upon attaining the statutory age of service.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria under the leadership of President Buhari congratulates and appreciates your selfless service to the Service and the nation at large. The country salutes your courage and on behalf of the President, I wish you well in your future endeavour.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Controller General of the Federal Fire Service, Dr. Liman Ibrahim noted that the phenomenal increase in fire fighting and emergency asset base under the watch of President Muhammadu Buhari was unprecedented in the history of the Service.\n\nHe stated further that the efforts were confirmation and demonstration of the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to ensuring the safety and security of lives and property of all Nigerians.\n\nThe highlight of the event were the pull-out ceremony of two Deputy Controllers General of the Service- Engr. Q.G. Azogu and K.C Agu as well as an Assistant Controller General, Thompson Mohammed.",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday ranked Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine rollout as the best in Africa in terms of storage and utilisation of the covid-19 vaccines for its population.\n\nIt noted that although Africa has not received its fair share of vaccines owing to global vaccine shortages, many African countries cannot still utilise their vaccines before they expire. It stated that many countries are now looking up to Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes.\n\nWHO Country Representative Dr. Kazadi Mulombo spoke during a joint news briefing on COVID-19 vaccination update of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMore than 1.8 billion vaccines are being distributed globally as of today, mostly in 10 countries. Africa is lagging behind, but even though Africa is lagging behind, Nigeria is among the countries that are distributing the most covid-19 vaccine as we speak. In terms of volume, we are still a long way to go because we plan to vaccinate more than 100 million of our population.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we are witnessing a kind of paradox. While on the one hand, the continent has received less of its share in terms of vaccines through the COVAX facility and other mechanisms. At the same time, we have a number of African countries that are losing the vaccines because they expired before they could be used. Some are redistributing the vaccines elsewhere. So, it is kind of sending a contradictory message about the need for vaccines to end the acute phase of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are some strategies that are being devised to prevent the loss of vaccines required under difficult circumstances.

It stated that many countries are now looking up to Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes.\n\nWHO Country Representative Dr. Kazadi Mulombo spoke during a joint news briefing on COVID-19 vaccination update of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMore than 1.8 billion vaccines are being distributed globally as of today, mostly in 10 countries. Africa is lagging behind, but even though Africa is lagging behind, Nigeria is among the countries that are distributing the most covid-19 vaccine as we speak. In terms of volume, we are still a long way to go because we plan to vaccinate more than 100 million of our population.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we are witnessing a kind of paradox. While on the one hand, the continent has received less of its share in terms of vaccines through the COVAX facility and other mechanisms. At the same time, we have a number of African countries that are losing the vaccines because they expired before they could be used. Some are redistributing the vaccines elsewhere. So, it is kind of sending a contradictory message about the need for vaccines to end the acute phase of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are some strategies that are being devised to prevent the loss of vaccines required under difficult circumstances. I am glad to say here that among most of the strategies that the Africa regional office of WHO is advocating for in terms of minimising the risk of losing the vaccine come from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe experience of engaging with strategic leaders, doing the weekly press briefing and continuous risk communication with the beneficiaries; all these engagements securing those for the second dose, while including other groups that were not included in the first phase are being shared today as best practices in terms of averting expiry of the covid-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis is to say that on the African continent, many countries are now looking at Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes.

          "text": "Following the report of recent attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen on Odoke, Ndiobasi, and Obakotara communities in Izhi, Ebonyi Local Government Area, an Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in Diaspora (AESID) has blamed governor Dave Umahi, for the continued killings in the state.\n\nThe Ebonyi indigenes said the recent attack is considered the highest number casualties in the South-east region in recent times, \u201cnatives of the three affected communities were slaughtered in their scores with many dead and several others critically injured.\u201d\n\nIn a statement made available to newsmen Tuesday in Abuja by the association\u2019s President Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, expressed disappointment that \u201cdespite earlier signs and premeditations including an alleged audio voice note widely circulated on the Social media which alerted on the plan to launch a fresh offensive on our defenseless citizens, the Ebonyi state government took no action to protect and defend the victims of this recent onslaught.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly pained that helpless and hapless women, children and youths were cut in their prime in a dastard carnage that spanned for some hours while their victims were deep in their sleep.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, medical and health-care workers in various parts of the State are offering treatments to scores of victims who sustained varying degrees of injuries during the attack. They have also been calls for ebullient citizens to provide clothing and other essential materials to the victims many of who are stranded in the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, AE-FUTHA, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cOur anxiety over this sadly depressing attacks is made worse by the fact that the State\u2019s Chief Security Officer, Engr. David Umahi on whose shoulders hugely lie the constitutional burden of protection of lives and properties of our beloved citizens has largely down-played all sensible and reasonable warnings about the activities of killer herdsmen.\n\nWhile condemning the massacre in Ebonyi communities, the group decried and questioned the conducts and activities of the men operating under the EbubeAgu Security network, saying \u201cthe outfit has remained what we had feared- a deliberate, willful and willing tool in the hands of the state government to hunt down, hound and maim members of the opposition- PDP and other voices.\n\n\u201cRather than seek practical and viable solutions that can quell the growing unrests and attacks on our people, AESID wishes to reiterate that Umahi is so deeply stuck in his 2023 politics that he is rather empowering and emboldening the \u2018bad guys\u2019 to attack and kill those he considers his opponents.\n\n\u201cThis group consequently condemn the claim that the attack took place in Benue State and the attempt by the State government to further downplay or trivialize not only the latest attack on Izhi communities but the entire security affairs in our dear State. The silence of the Speaker and political class in Izhi land, nay Ebonyi State and their inability to condemn these attack including the desperation of Umahi and his cahoots in security circles to always exonerate the provocative Fulani herdsmen from blames where and whenever they occur in Ebonyi demands thorough probe by International security bodies.\u201d\n\nAESID however, called on the state government to change tactics in addressing insecurity in Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cUnless perhaps he changes style and strategy on his current grandstanding and unbridled politicization of the security of lives and property of our people, AESID will continue to dump the blames of the killings of our people by marauding herders on the doorsteps of the Governor just as he continues to pay more attention and interest to his shadow-chasing 2023 political projections and campaigns!\u201d",

All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\u201d\n\nWhile recalling that hat he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 general elections, Buhari said: \u201cMajority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: No Third Term Agenda, Elections Will Hold \u2013 Buhari\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with constitutional provisions, adding that those misbehaving in certain parts of the country were obviously too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nHe added, \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nThe President said the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, President Buhari said he would give the electoral commission all it needed to operate, \u201cso that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the INEC Chairman said that so far, there have been 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide, since the last General Election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the Federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections.\n\n\u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections.

          "title": "Pulling Down Democratic Structures In Nigeria: Who Stands To Gain? *By Paul Ejime -",
          "text": "The phrase \u201cState of Emergency\u201d is being applied to virtually all aspects of life that it has become a clich\u00e9, especially in Africa. Indeed, security is now considered a national emergency in Nigeria, so is access to food, health care, education, religious worship, travelling, human rights, and governance. The freedom to live or die could be added to the long list of emergencies.\n\nEven so, the safety of life and property can never be treated with levity or taken for granted. Their protection or preservation is the primary responsibility of government.\n\nEqually paramount and indispensable are the structures or institutions of a nation-State. Governments come and go, but State structures and institutions are treasured and cherished not only because of their value/worth but also because of their indispensability to the nation-State\u2019s very existence, functioning, and sustainability.\n\nIn this context, the spate of arson and vandalism targeting the facilities and assets of Nigeria\u2019s security apparatus, especially the police and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), should be of grave concern as part of the general insecurity bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahood Yakubu, the Commission recorded 41 such attacks against its facilities between 2019 and May 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAddressing a recent meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) in Abuja, he gave a breakdown of the attacks as nine in 2019 and 21 in 2020, while \u201cin the last four weeks, 11 offices of the Commission were either set ablaze or vandalised.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo of these incidents were caused by Boko Haram and Bandit attacks, while 10 resulted from thuggery during election and post-election violence,\u201d the INEC Chair said, adding: \u201cHowever, the majority of the attacks (29 out of 41) were unrelated to elections or electoral activities.\n\n\u201cEighteen of the attacks occurred during the EndSARS protests in October last year, while 11 were organised by \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 and \u2018hoodlums,\u201d Prof Yakubu told the Committee, which membership includes, the Chiefs of Defence, Armed and Uniformed Forces and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith elections and electoral activities in Nigeria becoming an \u201call-year-round undertaking,\u201d the INEC Chief noted that the attacks, which \u201cinitially appeared as isolated and occasional actions have now become more frequent and systematic, targeted at demobilising and dismantling critical electoral infrastructure in the country.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, urged that \u201cthese attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities should now be treated as a national security emergency,\u201d warning that if unattended to \u201c(the attacks) will not only undermine the Commission\u2019s capacity to organise elections and other electoral activities but will also damage the nation\u2019s electoral process and democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven that INEC is still conducting several off-season elections, with major national elections due in 2023, this warning could not have been more eloquent and timely.\n\nExperience shows that democracy requires strong and effective structures and institutions to take root or thrive.\n\nThe 6th of January 2021 invasion of the American Congress by angry supporters of former President Donald Trump probably represented the lowest point of that country\u2019s democracy. However, it was also on that day that the American democracy demonstrated its greatest resilience and strength.\n\nThe \u201cconstitutional coup,\u201d \u201cinsurrection,\u201d or \u201cmob action\u201d incited by \u201ca powerful President\u201d to hang on to power, having lost the vote through the ballot, failed spectacularly, and democracy prevailed, simply because Congress proved itself as a solid and vital institution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from the key roles played by the government tripod \u2013 Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, the agencies involved in electoral security and the electoral umpires are critical to the conduct of credible elections and the entrenchment of true democracy.\n\nWhere and when the security architectures are vulnerable to arson and incessant attacks, national electoral commissions, such as INEC, are in jeopardy without adequate protection.\n\nThe INEC facilities being destroyed cost money and are repositories of sensitive national records. They serve the local communities for the most fundamental aspect of democratic governance \u2013 election. The facilities are also used for other critical electoral activities such as voter registration, the coordination of stakeholder engagements, voter education, and sensitisation. Therefore, the host communities should own and protect the facilities and properties as their contribution to enable INEC to deliver on its mandate.\n\nIn the midst of the ugly narrative, Prof Yakubu cited the exemplary support provided by some communities to the Commission over the years.\n\n\u201cSome of them actually donated the pieces of land on which some of our Local Government offices are built. Even in the recent events of arson and vandalism, many of them have demonstrated exceptional willingness to support the Commission,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor instance, following the vandalism of our offices in Osun State during the #EndSARS protests in October last year, the Ikirun community in Ifelodun Local Government Area and two communities in Ede South Local Government Area have offered to contribute to the repairs of the offices and promised to work with the Commission to protect them in future.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, in Nnewi North in Anambra State, the community has also offered to repair our Local Government office destroyed during the #EndSARS protests. The Commission does not take such partnerships for granted. I wish to thank our host communities in all parts of the country and appeal to them to continue to see INEC property as both national and local assets to be protected,\u201d Prof Yakubu affirmed.\n\nGiven that electoral umpires alone cannot secure their assets, it is the obligation of the relevant authorities and citizens to secure and protect these facilities, which are public/State assets that will outlive governments.\n\nExperience has shown that electoral umpires in Africa only receive major attention from the government mainly on the eve or during national elections. Many of them bear the \u201cIndependent or Autonomous\u201d title, but only in name, given the severe political pressure they face from the politicians and governments, which control their budgets and recruitment of their members.\n\nIn most cases, the electoral legal framework or Acts are riddled with ambiguities and loopholes for exploitation by the politicians or are observed in the breach by government agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Nigeria\u2019s draft Electoral Reform Bill is still pending before the National Assembly. Recently, a civil society group led a protest march to the National Assembly calling for the passage of the Bill, which all agree could improve the conduct of credible elections in the country.\n\nIt is an understatement that adequate and prompt release of funding, clarity of electoral legal framework, security and protection of the facilities and property of Electoral Management Bodies (EMB) are critical basic minimum requirements for building strong democratic institutions in any nation.\n\n*Paul Ejime, an Author and former Diplomatic/War Correspondent, is a Consultant on Communications, Media, Elections and International Affairs.",
