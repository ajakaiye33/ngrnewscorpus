          "text": "Former Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, has urged government to declare bandits as federal civil servants since it has failed to view them as terrorists.\n\nSani said this on Twitter while lamenting the killing of Christian and Muslim worshippers in their religious houses by bandits.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cThey [bandits] killed Muslim worshipers in their mosques in Niger and Katsina State; they killed Christians in their Churches in Kaduna State; if the Government doesn\u2019t want to declare them terrorists, it should declare them federal civil servants.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that some gunmen suspected to be bandits invaded Baptist Church, Kakau Daji in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing two while scores were said to be abducted.\n\nChairman of the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Joseph Hayab while reacting to the incident, said the attack was \u201canother sad story of how deteriorating our insecurity has become.\u201d\n\nHayab added, \u201cCitizens are being killed like chickens with only press statements as consolation.\n\n\u201cThese evil people have troubled us for too long.\n\n\u201cI condole the families of the Baptist denomination and Kaduna Christians for this loss and urge our security agencies to separate war against enemies of Nigerians from politics. No one knows who will be the next target.\u201d\n\nSani, who reacted to the incident in an earlier tweet, described as useless the suspension of telecommunication services in the North which was meant to tackle the bandits.\n\nHe said, \u201cYesterday\u2019s attacks on the Baptist Church Kakau Daji, Kaduna State by terrorists, the killing of some worshippers and the abductions of scores of others is tragic and unfortunate. The suspension of the telecom services in the North is useless.\u201d",

          "text": "In the wake of the raid of Justice Mary Peter-Odili\u2019s residence, a Justice of Supreme Court of Nigerian by unknown men suspected to be security operatives, ace comedian, I Go Dye, born Francis Agoda has written to the federal government to clean up its act in the areas of human rights abuses and rule of law.\n\nI Go Dye fears that if somebody of such caliber could be a victim of human rights abuse, then the common Nigerians are endangered species.\n\nHe writes, \u201c If a high profile personality like Justice of the Supreme Court; Justice Mary Odili\u2019s home could be illegally raided and no proper legal actions taken , then we are just embracing more dastardly actions in the near future where vigilantes would soon be illegally invading the homes of ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement of justice against human right abuses is the first fundamental fact that should be taken into consideration, to know if we have any rights in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe issue of human rights violations, of arresting our youths and citizens without appropriate procedures is really disgusting. However, the fact remains that the judiciary has not protected the citizens enough in this regard, so when a high profile personality like Justice of the Supreme Court is victimized in this regard, it reflects what the ordinary citizens go through in the hands of our law enforcement agents on regular occasions.\n\n\u201cWe may act, speak or collectively condemn such actions, but if your administrative/ legal unit in the judiciary fail to instigate the proper legal actions and punitive measure against the officers who carried out this raid on the Justice and other ordinary Nigerians, then we are just embracing more dastardly actions in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe may be strong today,some of us might be too influential to face such embarrassment but what about our children? What happens to our loved ones when we grow old and become too weak to act? There can\u2019t be a better time, than now, to effectively address this abnormality, by bringing justice upon those involved in all illegal actions on our citizens.\u201d\n\nSince the raid on the residence of the Justice, many Nigerians have reacted. The House of Representatives Committee on Judiciary has called for urgent discreet investigation into the raid, saying the siege was a repudiation of judicial independence and an assault on the sanctity of the nation\u2019s judiciary.",

The poor are dying as I\u2019m talking to you. So when the politicians beat their chest that they have done well, they are just talking for themselves while the poor man is exposed to all manners insecurity and hardship.\u201d\n\nHe added that as a clergyman, he meets the poor every day, feeds them, buys bags of rice and other foodstuffs to distribute to them, stressing that they were not doing that three years ago.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWe know that the lockdown from COVID-19 has affected so many things but many economies across the world have rebounded. Nigeria is only rebounding on paper and on TV where what the government has done is announced, but the public we met every day are not singing the same song of abject poverty.\u201d\n\nApostle Dr. Emmanuel Nuhu Kure warned those working against the progress of the country that the wind of justice from God will soon wipe them out, assuring that the wrath of God would soon catch up with them no matter how highly placed they may be in the society.\n\nThose working against the progress of the country, he said, \u201cWhether they be Muslims, Christians or any other, they will not escape the wrath of God because blood has been shed in all parts of the country. Nemesis will soon catch up with whoever has a hand in what millions of Nigerians are going through today.\n\n\u201cThe Almighty who created the earth is about to begin justice that will bring stability to this nation.

It is my understanding La Liga would have accepted it. But we cannot ask a player of Messi\u2019s stature to do this.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMessi has now hit back at Laporta for raising doubts about his strength of character instead of taking responsibility for his exit, while also reiterating that he did everything possible to remain at Barca.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that, as I explained on my way out, I did everything possible to stay, never at any time was I asked to play for free,\u201d the Argentine forward has told Sport.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI was asked to cut my salary by 50 per cent and I did it without any problem. We were in a position to help the club more. The desire of me and my family was to stay in Barcelona.\n\nRead Also: Tottenham sack Nuno Espirito Santo, set to appoint Conte\n\n\u201cNobody asked me to play for free but at the same time, it seems to me that the words said by the president are out of place. They hurt me because I think he doesn\u2019t need to say that, it\u2019s like getting the ball off you and not assuming its consequences, or taking charge of things.\n\n\u201cThis makes people think or generates a type of doubt that I think I do not deserve.\u201d\n\nMessi also discussed his chances of winning the Ballon d\u2019Or for the seventh time in December, having helped Barca lift the Copa del Rey in his final season at the club before securing his first piece of international silverware with Argentina at the Copa America.\n\nPressed on whether he expects to land a second successive Ballon d\u2019Or, Messi replied: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t think so. My biggest prize was what I was able to achieve with the national team. After having fought and fought so much for that achievement, it was the best for all it cost.\n\n\u201cIf the Ballon d\u2019Or arrives it would be extraordinary for what it would mean winning one more. The seventh would be crazy. If not, nothing happens. I have already achieved one of my great goals.\u201d\n\nIt has been suggested that Messi could retire from international football after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but he claims that the thought has not yet crossed his mind.\n\n\u201cNo, not really. Not really. After what happened to me, I live day by day, year by year,\u201d the ex-Barcelona captain added. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen in the World Cup or after the World Cup. I don\u2019t think about it. Whatever has to happen at that moment will happen.\u201d Goal",

          "text": "From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has declared that it would back a candidate from any region for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nSpokesman of the forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed, stated this in an interview with Daily Sun at the sideline of the fourth Malam Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture at the University of Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\nHe, however, said the north would not accept a presidential candidate thrown up for the 2023 poll by a political party on the basis of regional consideration.\n\nAhmed, in a paper delivered at the lecture on behalf of NEF, entitled: \u201cThe President we want\u201d warned that the north would turn its back to any party that deliberately tilts advantages to presidential candidates from particular regions in the 2023 electioneering.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the president to emerge as a product of ethnic or religious pushes. We don\u2019t want a president that will be answerable to a portion of Nigeria. We won\u2019t accept it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe flayed moves by a section of the country to occupy the presidential office through violence, saying it was counter-productive to peace and unity efforts. He said the current situation in the country does not require a leader produced by cohesion or secession threats.\n\n\u201cThe next president should emerge from a credible election from any part of the country but he or she must be first and foremost a Nigerian president. The north would back any credible candidate from the region who understand the problem, possess capacity to solve them (challenges) and can build bridges across the country.\u201d\n\nAhmed said the north was concerned about the violence in the South East as much as it was worried by insecurity in parts of the north.\n\nHe, however, said the north would not be cowed by threats of secession ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want organised violence or threat to produce the president of Nigeria. Secession is a bad option for South East. It is not in the best interest of this country or anybody.\u201d\n\nHe asked self-determination group, IPOB, to stop the violence in the region.\n\n\u201cWhy should the Federal Government allow IPOB to strangulate five South East states? If this administration do not have the capacity and willingness to ask this question, to deal with this problem, then the next administration should do so.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, pan-Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and former Anambra State Governor, Dr Chukwuemka Ezeife, have knocked Ahmed over his comment that the north would not accept any presidential candidate from any political party for the 2023 election if such candidate emerged on the basis of regional consideration.\n\nPublicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said NEF spokesman by his statements and pronouncements has over time shown he does not love Nigeria.\n\nOgbonnia said Ahmed lacked the knowledge of Nigeria\u2019s political history as all the country\u2019s presidents since 1999 were products of regional agitations.\n\n\u201cMany patriotic Nigerians have discovered that from all his remarks Dr Ahmed does not love Nigeria. He should know that all Nigeria\u2019s presidents since 1999 emerged due to regional agitation. President Olusegun Obasanjo emerged due to the massive agitation by the South West after the election of Chief Moshood Abiola was annulled. Based on the agitation, the rulers at that time in their wisdom conceded the presidency to the South West. After the Obasanjo presidency, the north agitated that it was their turn and that agitation produced President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. Of course, the agitations from PANDEF and other South South groups during the Yar\u2019Adua gave rise to the amnesty programme to the Niger Delta militants and also produced the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan. Even the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari is a product of collective agitation by the north.\n\n\u201cSo, it is clear that the NEF spokesman doesn\u2019t know what he is saying and he has no knowledge of Nigerian political history or political science. Agitation is part of democracy. The agitation by the South East for example or any other region is a way of expressing dissatisfaction with the status quo. Well-meaning patriotic Nigerians who understand the need for the continued corporate existence of Nigeria should concede the 2023 presidency to the South East because it is an agitation that is asking for equity and justice.\u201d\n\nReacting, President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said the statement only showed that the north was afraid of southerners taking over from Buhari. He said the statement was insulting to other Nigerians because the issue of credibility was not an exclusive preserve of the north as there were qualified candidates to rule Nigerians from all over the country.\n\nHe also dissociated the Middle Belt from the statement saying: \u201cEven in the north, they are not speaking for us because we are Middle Belters and we are not going to play second fiddle to anybody. All the falsehood they have been adducing about the population, which doesn\u2019t exist, will be exposed with time. But, as far as I am concerned, his statement means he is afraid of a southern Nigerian taking over from Buhari because they know they have committed a lot of atrocities. I want to advise them to get out of that fear and become true Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso, Ezeife, said the position of the NEF spokesman was consistent with his mannerism. He, however, said the quest for the Nigerian President of Igbo extraction in 2023 should start with getting the November 6 Anambra State election right.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023 is needed to douse the political tension in the country, however, that is not our problem now. It is important to first ensure a peaceful Anambra State governorship election on November 6. If we get the right governor for Anambra State, we will get our man for the 2023 presidential poll, but if the election is rigged and we lose Anambra State to the wrong person, then it will be difficult for our hope for 2023 to be realised.\u201d\n\nHe lauded IPOB for understanding the value of supporting the election by calling off their sit-at-home.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The source attributed to loss of Oyinlola in the contest for the deputy national chairman(North) to Makinde.\n\nAccording to the source, immediately the former Osun State governor lost the support of Makinde, the other 12 PDP governors decided to rally round their Oyo counterpart against him.\n\n\u201cImmediately Oyinlola lost the support of Makinde, he also lost the support of the other governors. Though he had the support of Atiku( Abubakar); (Bukola) Saraki and Sule Lamido, the governors were determined that no candidate will emerge without their support. At the end of the day, only candidates backed by the governors emerged. The governors are optimistic that same thing will happen during the presidential primary. They have taken full control of the party,\u201d the source stated.\n\nHowever, former Minister of Transport, Ebenezer Babatope told our correspondent, in a telephone interview that the influence of the governors in determining NWC members is not new.\n\nNevertheless, Babatope recalled that \u201cwhen the last time my friend, Olabode George contested for the chairmanship of the party, they ( governors) came out with a unity list. I have always objected to that kind of list. But they came out in support of Secondus and ensured he defeated Bode George. What has happened now?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Oyinlola has hailed the newly elected national officers. It was gathered that he had earlier sent a private message to Arapaja, congratulating and wishing him a successful tenure. Arapaja was said to have also acknowledged the message with appreciation.\n\nOyinlola who described the success of the national convention as a good omen for Nigeria and Nigerians, said he was confident the party is in good hands.\n\nHe also thanked the founding fathers, all party leaders and his supporters across the country, for the strength of their support for him and their love which they radiated around him throughout the contest.\n\nThe former governor lauded his colleagues in the PDP Governors Forum for holding the forte of the party while promising that he would continue to play his role as a leader and strengthen his support for the PDP and its organs.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Says people thought convention would break up party\n\n*Dares APC to conduct own convention\n\n*Ekweremadu congratulates new officials\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha\n\nThe newly affirmed National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has said the mission of the party under his leadership was to rescue the nation from the current mess, occasioned by the misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government since 2015.\n\nAyu, who spoke early Sunday morning also appreciated the PDP delegates and the party\u2019s governors for conducting a smooth and peaceful national convention\n\nHe however, dared the APC to conduct its national convention from the over 90 states factional chairmen, while stating that some members of the party thought that the PDP would break up as the aftermath of the convention.\n\nThis is as a former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has congratulated Ayu, and other 20 national officers-elect, who emerged at the just concluded national convention of the party.\n\nIn his appreciation speech after 3,426 delegates affirmed his election as the chairman, Ayu said, \u201cI want to sincerely appreciate the PDP family. Today is simply a thank you address. When we started this party 23 years ago, we never in any way imagined that the journey will get us to this stage.\n\n\u201cA stage, where we ruled for 16 years, we went into rough times, but for anybody, who bothered to see, PDP is back. PDP is back to rescue Nigeria from the terrible mess we have been in, in the last six years. I want to appreciate all of you, who have taken time as delegates, as observers, as supporters, as members of the media, as members of the security services, who have made this event wonderful.\n\n\u201cMany people imagined that this convention will lead to the break-up of the PDP. Those people, who are dreaming like that, they were dreaming in wonderland. Their dreaming were misplaced.\n\n\u201cThose, who have lost hope should know that Nigeria is not a divided country. A small group of people decided to divide Nigeria. PDP will come back to unite our people, put them together, North and South, East and West.\n\n\u201cWe will move ahead to develop this country. We did it before. We are going to do it again. I want to thank the governors. I want to thank the delegates. I want to thank our supporters and every single person, who has made this event such a huge success.\n\n\u201cI believe the other party can never hold a convention, because even state congress, they cannot hold. They have produced 92 state chairmen for 36 states, how can they hold a successful convention, which the PDP has done? We are waiting for them. This is a challenge to them. Let them come on pole searches, successful on ledger with what the PDP has done. This is a quit notice. PDP is back and is taking back the country to develop it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PDP elected a new set of members into its National Working Committee (NWC) to take over its leadership.\n\nTwenty-one people were elected at its national convention, which began on Saturday, October 30, and lasted till Sunday, October 31, at the Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nAyu was declared national chairman after 3,426 delegates affirmed his unopposed position. The outcome of the election was announced in the early hours of yesterday.\n\nIn the same manner, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, from Southeast emerged the National Secretary of the party unopposed.\n\nTHISDAY had earlier reported that 18 out of the 21 National Working Committee (NWC) offices were unopposed.\n\nThe office of the Deputy National Chairman (South), was keenly contested and Amb. Taofeek Arapaja, was declared winner after polling 2,004 votes at the party\u2019s convention.\n\nHis closest contender, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, garnered 705 votes.\n\nThe position of the National Youth Leader, was won by Mohammed Kadade Sulieman with 3,072 against his closest rival, Usman ElKudan, who polled 219, while the Deputy National Chairman (North), was clinched by Umar Iliya Damagum, who polled 2,222 to defeat former Minister of Women Affairs, Hajia Maryam Ina Ciroma, who polled 365.\n\nChairman of the Convention Planning Committee and Chairman, Electoral Sub-Committee of the convention, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State, announced the results and commended party faithful for what he described as a successful convention.\n\nOther elected officers through the party\u2019s unopposed contest that scored 3,426 votes were Ahmed Yayari Mohammed as national treasurer and Kamaldeen Adeyemi Ajibade, the national legal adviser.\n\nUmar Bature is the new national organising secretary, Daniel Woyegikuro emerged national financial secretary, Stella Effah-Attoe is the new national woman leader and Okechukwu Obiechina Daniel, national auditor.\n\nSetonji Koshoede is the new deputy national secretary, Ndubisi Eneh David, deputy national treasurer, Ibrahim Abdullahi is the deputy national publicity secretary, Ighoyota Amori, deputy national organising secretary, Adamu Kamale, deputy national financial secretary, Hajaja Yakubu Wanka, deputy national woman leader, Timothy Osadolor, deputy national youth leader and Okechukwu Osuoha, deputy national legal adviser.\n\nFull List of New PDP National Officials:\n\nNational Chairman \u2013 Iyorchia Ayu\n\nDeputy National Chairman (North) \u2013 Umar Damagum (Contested)\n\nDeputy National Chairman (South) \u2013 Taofeek Arapaja (Contested)\n\nNational Secretary \u2013 Samuel Anyanwu (Unopposed)\n\nNational Treasurer \u2013 Ahmed Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nNational Organising Secretary \u2013 Umar Bature (Unopposed)\n\nNational Financial Secretary \u2013 Daniel Woyegikuro (Unopposed)\n\nNational Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Professor Stella Effah-Attoe (Unopposed)\n\nNational Youth Leader \u2013 Muhammed Suleiman (Contested)\n\nNational Legal Adviser \u2013 Kamaldeen Ajibade (Unopposed)\n\nNational Publicity Secretary \u2013 Debo Ologunagba (Unopposed)\n\nNational Auditor \u2013 Okechuckwu Daniel (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Secretary \u2013 Setoji Kosheodo (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Treasurer \u2013 Ndubisi David (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Publicity Secretary \u2013 Ibrahim Abdullahi (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Organising Secretary \u2013 Ighoyota Amori (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Financial Secretary \u2013 Adamu Kamale (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Hajara Wanka (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Youth Leader \u2013 Timothy Osadolor (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Legal Adviser \u2013 Okechukwu Osuoha (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Auditor \u2013 Abdulrahman Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nMeanwhile, Ekweremadu, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Uche Anichukwu, in Abuja on Sunday, said the emergence of Ayu and other national officers would give the PDP the much-needed renewed vigour and focus required to rescue Nigeria.\n\nThe ranking Senator also commended the Elder Yemi Akinnwonmi-led leadership of the party and the Governor Ahmadu Fintiri-led National Convention Planning Committee for seamless and transparent elections, saying the PDP has disappointed her evil wishers.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis is hearty congratulations to the newly elected national officers of our great party, the PDP. Given the pedigree and antecedents of our National Chairman-elect and his team, I have no doubt that we got it right.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in dire need of rescue from the clutches of divisiveness, criminal cartels, vaunting bandits and insurgents, collapsing economy (to put it mildly), and secessionist agitations occasioned by injustice and marginalisation.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that we have in place a highly promising team led by a widely-accepted, disciplined, experienced, and pan-Nigerian politician in the person of Distinguished Senator Iyorchia Ayu, that will help mobilise party faithful and Nigerians at home and the diaspora for the success of this mission\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rotimi Amaechi: Our 2019 Experience Won\u2019t Happen Again in Rivers",
          "text": "The Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s disposition to any media engagement is nothing short of an opportunity to relax and unwind, even when the issues involved are serious. With candour and humour, he always waltzes through, no matter the stretch of time. Yet, Amaechi is not one of those sources, who would ask to have your questions in advance or an idea of the areas you intend to cover, although nothing is bad in being prepared for an interview. Just \u2018come and shoot\u2019, whilst he plays through the session, curiously, dealing with some of the most difficult questions arising from his beat. Interestingly, his familiar approach to what might have been considered obnoxious issues, took a different form this time, making the time spent with THISDAY a lot more interactive. From the business of railway infrastructure development in the country to concerns in the maritime sector, the local politics of Rivers State, the clamour for power shift, the man called Muhammadu Buhari and the journey to the 2023 presidential bout, the former governor of Rivers State, had his answers structured for every probing question, somewhat. Excerpts:\n\nFor nearly 6 years, you\u2019ve been the minister of transportation and the major focus has been mainly railway infrastructure. How has the journey been like?\n\nThe journey has been tough; it has not been easy, honestly. There is somebody that I am battling with now or a group of people that I am battling with. They are trying to blackmail me, they want me to give them a contract and they have come to me physically and I said no. Now that the contract is in the process of approval, they have sent some text messages to me. Let me just show you the message they sent to me so that you can see how bad they are, but me, I will never fall for blackmail.\n\nListen to what they sent to me: \u201cWe are working on a cargo-tracking note story and we need the minister\u2019s reply to some questions below. The VP says the minister has contravened the public procurement act in obtaining the presidential approval for the contract.\u201d How do you contravene a public procurement act when you have a presidential approval? Don\u2019t forget I said they had approached me physically. When they could not reach me, they got to my wife. And so, for not giving them, they now contracted a press team and I say they can publish. At least, I have got approval from the president.\n\nThree times they tried to stop it, they got some government officials to stop it \u2013 three times \u2013 but I still continued. Having failed in the last one, which happened two weeks ago, they have now contracted a press team. So those are the things you meet in the course of your work as a minister of transport. It has not been easy. If anybody thinks it is easy, it is not, coupled with the fact that there is a political element to the issue of railway construction. And I told a joke, I said see the Yoruba, they are not complaining, no shouting, nothing because we have done Lagos-Ibadan. If we had not done Lagos-Ibadan, the Yoruba would have been shouting by now.\n\nSo that is the political element to it. It is just like the Igbo are saying, oh, you have done nothing for our side. They merit having a railway but I have always said that railway construction is not political; it is economics. I am constructing Lagos-Ibadan, not because I want to satisfy the Yoruba, it is because Lagos-Kano will generate about 11 million tons of cargo. So in the whole of the country, that figure by far makes economic sense for anybody who wants to construct a railway than going to construct, for instance, from South-south. If the South-south is about 3 million or 4 million tons, I will first and foremost construct Lagos to Kano, because it makes more economic sense than doing the one where I come from.\n\nSo we are pursuing Lagos to Kano, and as we are talking now, we are constructing from Kano to Kaduna. We have finished Lagos to Ibadan, we are looking for money to go from Ibadan to Abuja to complete the whole gamut of Lagos to Kano. Now, the next most important rail line to Lagos \u2013Kano is Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, which includes the South East area, because it has 11 million tons of cargo. We have not been able to generate the data for Lagos to Calabar. The president has said to me, Ameachi, complete Lagos to Kano, Port Harcourt to Maiduguri and then Lagos to Calabar. These are the three most important rail lines in Nigeria. The next one will be the central line, which is Itakpe to Warri but then, there is a new addition, which comes from Abuja to Barro to Itakpe. That is the central line. Once we finish this, the areas that will be remaining will be Yola, Adamawa, Taraba, Gusau in Zamfara, Sokoto and Kebbi. These are the five states that are remaining and we are working towards it. They are not contiguous and that is why we are finding it difficult. The professionals are doing their feasibility studies so that we can add them.\n\nYou have the numbers for Lagos to Kano, the volume it carries, 11 million tons, what is the economic data that supports the construction of Kano to Maradi rail?\n\nI have answered that question to the whole country. I have answered it outside Nigeria. I have also answered my wife and children. We did not design Kano-Maradi; it was not our idea. We met it on the table. Somebody told me that it was Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government that did the feasibility studies and design and all that, I don\u2019t know how true it is. Two, it is a critical arrangement between Nigeria and ECOWAS. So Nigeria is bound to do two major rail lines to join the West African rail line, that is, Lagos to Seme and Kano to Maradi. And for me, Kano to Maradi makes more economic sense than Lagos to Seme. Maradi makes more economic sense than Seme.\n\nDon\u2019t forget Benin Republic is a competing nation. They are competing with Nigeria, because they are a coastal state; they have a seaport. What ECOWAS is trying to do is to bring landlocked states to be able to use their waters. So you shouldn\u2019t be encouraging your neighbouring state that has waters. What you should do is to see how you can make sure it does not have enough cargo. If you want to do that, then, Kano rail becomes a priority. I now said okay, Nigeria will fulfil its obligation by constructing Kano to Maradi. I flew to Niger Republic, had a meeting with the prime minister and said to him, \u2018look, we are going to construct rail line from Kano to Maradi and we are already constructing Lagos to Kano, which means that, if you board in Maradi, you will not stop anywhere until you get to Lagos. What is the benefit? The seaport in Lagos becomes busier than it is now, because they have promised us and we should put that in writing. I am not a lawyer; I have to imbibe that culture of putting things in writing. I usually believe that everybody is a gentleman but these are nations \u2013 Nigerian nation and Niger Republic. There is a need for us to put it in writing. They have agreed that their country will import national cargos through Lagos seaport. That is the way to make money out of the Kano-Maradi rail line.\n\nBut how do you action that in an international court, assuming they reneged on the agreement?\n\nHow did you action Bakassi? An agreement is an agreement. I am a law student; I am a fourth-year law student. I am doing a double degree in law. I am doing LLB Law at Base University, LLB law at the University of London. I have done contracts here and there, and contract means if you and I reached an agreement, in any form \u2013 whether oral or written \u2013you are bound to keep to that agreement. Any breach of it, I will go to court. There are so many international agreements in the world. Like this one I told you now, why are we doing Kano to Maradi? Because there is an agreement between all the West African states that each person will do its own.\n\nYet, the president said on national television that he was doing the rail to Maradi because his cousins were there?\n\nHe was joking. You know how our elders saw Nigeria; they saw Nigeria as a big brother to everybody. Unlike now because of poverty, we the younger ones are saying no, no, our leaders keep that your concept of Nigeria being big brother. So our president is still seeing Nigeria as a big brother to everybody. It is not the nature of the president to explain to you, which I have done now. I go to the cabinet and they ask me questions, some people attack me and I defend it. The approval by the cabinet was not done by the president alone, it was done by all of us. So when the president tells you they are our cousins, he was trying to make you remember that all of us are one. If somebody from Niger walks in here now and doesn\u2019t open his mouth, will you know? Just like if a Cross River person walks in here, you won\u2019t know; you will think he is a Rivers man until our intonations come to play.\n\nA lot of people thought or believed that the president must have influenced that particular contract.\n\nOh\u2026 no no no, it is so annoying when I hear statements like that. Do you know why I said that? I wrote to the President four years ago, he refused to approve for a different reason. His argument was that, I am the president of the country, if you take the rail to pass through Daura, it will look as if I influenced it. And I made a joke to him. I said, \u2018Oga don\u2019t worry, when we get to the boundary between Daura and there, we will jump to Katsina and leave Daura alone.\n\nThe Maritime University in Daura, or is it Transport University? Some people described it as another northern agenda. What informed locating in a place like Daura?\n\nThere is no maritime university in Daura. That is where they say my arrogance comes in. What is in Daura is Transport University. The Maritime University is in Okorokiko in Delta. What you have in Daura is Transport University and the federal government or you and I are paying no kobo. I usually brag about it and say, I could have taken that money, get CCECC $50 million to go and invest in Duara and build a university for us. Why? Because you can build all these railway tracks and all that but the day the Chinese go, you don\u2019t have any technology to manage it. We had a battle. They agreed, just like I had a battle, that they should build one in my village. By the way, they are building one in my village and it is called federal university.\n\nMuch as Nigerians love the feats in the railway sector, there had been concerns about endless borrowings to fund it. Do you think the worries are misplaced?\n\nAgain, that is where you people accuse me of arrogance. What is the evidence about borrowing? So far, we have only borrowed $1.4 billion in my ministry, which is for Lagos to Ibadan. If you do your investigations, Lagos to Ibadan is $2 billion, the federal government is putting $600 million and we have put in $600 million even though we still owe less than $100 or $200 million. Now, we borrowed $1.4 billion \u2013 that\u2019s what we borrowed.\n\nUnder President Goodluck Jonathan, they borrowed $500 million to do Abuja-Kaduna. So Abuja-Kaduna which is $1billion, the Chinese government gave us $500 million. If you add the two, it is $2.1 billion since Goodluck Jonathan. Kano-Maradi is $1.9 billion, we have not borrowed, yes, we have seen the money for Kano-Maradi but until we sign the agreement, we have not borrowed. We have not seen the money for Ibadan to Abuja, the Chinese are no longer giving the money they wanted, so we are looking for the money. We are looking for money for Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, which is $3.020 billion. We have not borrowed.\n\nWhen we go to the National Assembly, it is to get the approval, which is the requirement to get a loan, because your parliament must agree that you can borrow. For Kano-Kaduna, up till now, we are funded about $300 million dollars from the budget. As I am talking today, they are constructing Kano-Kaduna. The only place you can say we borrowed will be Lagos-Ibadan, $1.6billion; Abuja-Kaduna, $500 million and we don\u2019t have money yet. So when people say we are borrowing money, I am tired of explaining. Let me give you an example. I go to the cabinet and say, I want to do Port Harcourt-Maiduguri, $3.020 billion, people will shout\u2026Amaechi! They will exclaim.\n\nBut they have forgotten that all we have got was an approval to find the money. As I am talking to you now, I am scouting around the world to look for $3.020 billion. I am looking for money to do Lagos-Calabar, which covers my area, South-south; it is not there, $11.1 billion. We have seen some movement of cash; they have told us that they will give us $300 million to start while we look for $1.65 billion. Supposing we finished the $300 million and they say they don\u2019t have money, what will you do? But so far, they have not given us any money, which is why I said I have seen, because once you put pen to paper, they will raise the first $300 million for us to commence construction.\n\nCentral line is even the worst, the Chinese company said they want to do PPP, we signed and got the contract for them to sign, now they said no, we should convert it to contract. I said no, I will not. Instead of me to convert it to contract, I will cancel it. We will advertise it and I won\u2019t let you bid. You misled us. When you are asking for PPP, everybody I met in the world told me there is nowhere since the world was created that they have seen PPP in railway. And they said there could always be a first time. Now, they have gone to look for the money and can\u2019t find the money. They say we should convert to a contract, but I will not and I will go back to the cabinet to ask for cancellation. So all these things you are hearing \u2013 all of them put together \u2013 is about $36 billion dollars. We have not got more than $2 billion.\n\nThe ones you have borrowed, are they repayable, I mean can it repay the loan?\n\nWe are already paying. We have paid over $100 million for Abuja-Kaduna. And to contribute to the payment, the ministry of transport has said to the ministry of finance, once you remove the operational cost for the rail lines, take the rest. And operational cost is about a 100-and-something million naira and we are making N350 million now.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem of model, because the Lagos-Lekki expressway is a toll road. So what are you doing to your rails?\n\nIs there anywhere they toll rail? There is nowhere they toll rail. In fact, if railways are tolled, rail will be the cheapest means of transportation. We are here subsidising rail. You have to understand that rail is not only for passengers, it is also for cargos. So what you should say is that why is Nigeria not producing? We don\u2019t produce anything. A man met me and said we don\u2019t have rail in my town and I said tell me what you want me to do. If I bring rail to your town, what will it be carrying? Absolutely nothing. The only reason I encouraged the president to continue the rail construction is this, at the end of the day, when Nigerians begin to produce, they won\u2019t tell us they had logistical problems, because what train is about, is logistics. But here, what are you moving? There are no metals or iron ore, not even chicken. We have the capacity to move fuel, diesel. If you are going to Ibadan, once you reach Kajola, look to the left, you will see our wet cargo wagons.\n\nWe have wagons that can carry frozen cargos. They are all there, we bought them. But unfortunately, we are not producing. I thank God for making me a minister. I used to come across people of affluence, and when the president said we want a new shipping line according to the law. What does the law say? The law says that Nigerians will hold 60% shares and foreigners will hold 40% shares. I was very enthusiastic as a young man who wants to get everything done. I boarded a plane to Singapore, and we got a Singaporean company that says they will bring the 40%. Till today, no Nigerian has raised one kobo.\n\nTalking about rail, you once said the solution lies in rail. Now, you have been a minister for about 6 years, and not much has changed, would you say you have failed on Apapa?\n\nHow can I say that? The crisis in Apapa is not ours. Why I said the solution lies on the rail is that the moment you take the rail to the key side, any cargo that comes in just stops on the rail. Why have we not done that? Two things are affecting us. The first one is that, in the course of construction, there was a place that they used to dump waste. We thought by engineering this, we had found a solution to it, so we laid the tracks and passed. Few months after, depression started, the engineers called our attention to it. The consulting supervising company, the Chinese company, all of them came and said no, we need to find the technology to deal with it. Further investigation showed that it was 10 meters deep. The Chinese have reviewed that, to excavate the 10 meters and do soil replacement.\n\nThe Italians, who are the supervising engineers, said no, that it requires bridging. That is what I approved two weeks ago. Now, we have given the Chinese the directive to do that, so that there will be no further depression. They told us it will be done in six months. What they agreed with us was that by December, they would have finished work there. But that was because the Chinese thought it was soil replacement. So if I had approved soil replacement, it would have taken them one month to excavate the 10 meters and get soil somewhere else, maybe in Ogun or anywhere to replace it. But the other company felt that a more permanent solution would be a bridging facility, which I have approved.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer it will take them. When they finish that, there is another problem in front, near the key. The custom building that has scanners, and scanners come with dangerous chemicals. So we get a company from outside the country to come and take it away. That will take us some few months. The president has already approved cargos that can go on road transportation. Once we finish that, we will now compel those people who do not meet the requirements for road transportation to use the railway facility up to Ibadan. I have told the governor of Oyo State to prepare once we start this. I would have done him one good thing, our last station is outside Ibadan. So do a road that links that station to the express so that nobody comes into Ibadan because if they come into Ibadan, they will clog Ibadan. But if you do that road to the express, anybody who is coming will just drive from there, pack at our station, pick up his cargo and leave.\n\nAre you likely running this rail infrastructure at a loss presently?\n\nThere is nowhere in the world that they make profit in railways, except, probably China. But it is very small. So yes. When it comes to Abuja-Kaduna, we have moved from N70 million profit per month to N350 million. If you look at the cost of construction, you must deduct it from it to know whether you are making a loss, because no rail line has been able to pay for itself. So if you say, I want to pay for this rail line, and you make N350 million per month, multiply it by 12, that means our grandchildren will pay what we are paying. But if I see it from the other way of being a politician, I can say yes, I am making N350 million per month in Abuja-Kaduna, I am not making that much in Lagos, yet, because we are yet to introduce the number of rail.\n\nBy December, we\u2019ll introduce 16 trains per day, 8 going and 8 coming and each will contain 14 couches. So I should be able to make money also in Lagos-Ibadan. Where we may not make money is Warri-Itakpe. The reason we may not make money on Warri-Itakpe is because first, there are no passengers, because it\u2019s not meant for passengers. It\u2019s for iron ore and cargo.\n\nTalking about making money, there are allegations of ticket racketeering.\n\nIf at all there is, maybe Lagos, because we have cleaned that out in Abuja-Kaduna when we introduced e-ticketing. Let me let you know, I am under the same pressure for this electronic ticketing in Lagos. So in Lagos, it may be possible if at all there is ticket racketeering. But it is not as pronounced as it was in Abuja-Kaduna. In Abuja-Kaduna, we arrested the guy and took him to court. And he had a good case. He said look, I am a Nigerian and a businessman. I buy tickets and resell, what is wrong with that? He said, he comes early in the morning, buys ticket, say 20 at N1000 and resells for N2000, what is your business? But he lost the case.\n\nThe issue of safety and security in the railway business. How are you handling that especially, in the light of the recent bombing of the Kaduna rail tracks?\n\nYou know when people asked me before, I was saying it was not bombing. But the security information I got this morning indicated that it was an IED. So whoever gave them that sense to put nitrate, ammonia and every other thing, to put on the track, then, we need to be more careful than we have been. The first thing is that we are going to talk with the Air Force again. Before, the air force used to fly above all our routes, so they see whoever is on the track at any time. But I think at a time they stopped, maybe because of the cost of doing that. So we need to re-introduce that.\n\nThe next thing we need to introduce is the rail bus. We have a rail bus that runs on the track. If a train is coming, it can just veer off, so when the train is gone it comes back. The third and final one is that we are going back to cabinet to get approval for a digitalised security system. What that digital system does is that if you touch the track, it triggers wherever we are. So you know who is on the track and you see the track end-to-end and you are able to make decisions. It doesn\u2019t stop people from walking on the track but we are seeing it and we know what they are doing. If we had installed it, you would have seen the gentleman who dropped that IED on the track.\n\nAre you likely to be able to recoup these investments?\n\nAs I said, in railways, you cannot recoup. It is just what you need to grow your economy. Take for instance, what impact that act would have had on people who live between Abuja and Kaduna? Most people who could not afford to pay house rent in Abuja are now living in Kaduna and coming to work at 6am. They arrive here at 8am and go to work. So you are looking at how much the person has saved. Now, what happens to the economy of Kaduna? Landlords will make more money because they now have tenants. The micro economy of Kaduna will grow. You cannot see railways put money in your hand, it just grows an economy. And that is what we have done so far. But the greatest economy the rail will grow is the productive economy.\n\nYour government has been in power for almost 7 years and one of the issues has been Nigeria being a consumption economy. What is really being done to make the country productive?\n\nYou would think I am a sycophant when I say you should praise the president. And why did I say you should praise the president? I visited Borno when we campaigned for Dr Peter Odili and I saw that watermelon was growing in the wild, not planted. If you go to Borno and plant watermelon on 100,000 hectares of land, imagine how many people you will employ. Imagine whether Boko Haram will survive. The reason people will enroll in Boko Haram is just hunger, it is not religion. Hunger which is driven by poverty and a lack of education. So if I were the governor of Bornu State, I would focus on education and how to reduce poverty. Why do people join Boko Haram? Hopelessness! Don\u2019t forget the reason Nigeria could move and progress in the past was because we had hope. Nigeria used to believe that once an administration comes, in four years\u2019 time, they will go.\n\nAnother administration comes and repeats what the last one did. They will be hoping that the next one will be better. But now it is so hopeless that they don\u2019t even believe that anyone and anything will change. So we\u2019ve lost hope and because Nigerians have lost hope, they are taking the laws into their hands since there is nothing to live for. The reason you can see a man commit suicide is because there is nothing to live for. Now, if Boko Haram calls you and say, take 5, 000 naira and go and bomb this man, it is because if he doesn\u2019t take it, nothing will change. So we need to give hope and how is the Buhari government giving hope? Have you looked at our contribution in Agriculture? In a rural economy like the Nigerian economy, if we can\u2019t manufacture, then, you can do agric production.\n\nI remember before I became speaker in Rivers State, everybody was going to look for work and they had other sectors of the economy. We were producing cream and all other things, the value chain was there. It was in my regime but I now sold it to a Belgian. The general manager who actually built it was ashamed that he handed over the thing, because Nigerians don\u2019t produce. They don\u2019t care. They want money to just feed; they don\u2019t even ask how the money comes. If you are not getting the money, they say you are a thief but when you share the money with them, that is when you are a good man.\n\nBut a report by AFEXT, a commodity trading exchange, claimed that production has been poor because of insecurity.\n\nI agree. Where is the incentive? We are not here for only two years, it is not something that started happening two years ago, we\u2019ve been here six years. Before, we used to import chicken. I am into poultry farming. You know Obasanjo started as a poultry farmer. He could not get the licence to buy GPS and he knew only one person had that licence. Now, a few people bought the parent stock from that licence, because you won\u2019t import. And that person did not have the capacity to produce the parent stock for us to buy, so chicken was being imported. Yar\u2019Adua (former president Umar) came and expanded it to 15 persons. I was one of the 15 people that could buy GPS. Buhari came and removed everything and said, \u201cAnybody who wants to buy GPS can go and buy.\u201d\n\nNow, people can buy GPS. So GPS starts producing PS. You have in the country people know who and who is producing. And the fact that he said we won\u2019t use our dollar from NNPC to go and buy GPS outside means that even though it is more expensive, because if you buy chicken from outside it is $1. If you buy from Nigeria it is $3 but at least, we have started producing. It will get to a point where MTN got. Remember, when we started the GSM, it was very expensive, as soon as everybody stepped into the market, the thing started coming down. Now, everybody is saying there is glut. Sometimes, there is a glut in the poultry market, because everybody is now producing.\n\nYou know India or Croatia is the highest producer of banana but you know India imports banana because they are 1.4 billion people. In Rivers State, I had a banana plantation as a government. The young man who came there chased away the Mexican company. This thing you people call RUGA started in Rivers State. We got N3 billion, paid Israeli company to come and gave them 10,000 hectares of land to start constructing houses for 1000 persons. They built schools, markets, church for those who wanted to go to church. So the housing was for accommodation and each person had 100 hectares of land. As soon as the man came, he took the money back from the Israeli company and the company left. The company was introduced to me by Obi Ezekwesili.\n\nSo imagine 1000 people in 10,000 hectares of land all farming. Even if they don\u2019t feed anybody, they will feed their 1000 wives. They will feed their children, that means you have taken out 3,000 people from the poverty index. You see, what the president is doing is to create opportunities. If you want the government to give you approval, show him evidence of how many jobs it will create. So when you said it was not our government, I wonder how. Take the railway for instance, it was the Obasanjo government that started railway modernisation but that was theory, which was on paper. When I came, I dusted the paper and read it through and I said, let\u2019s go to the field.\n\nThe Goodluck Jonathan government started the Abuja-Kaduna, but at a point they stopped. They could not pay the money. We had to pay the money. When I came, I told the President to call the minister of finance, and the woman said, I should go and look for money. The woman still insisted on the budget, and the president said, \u2018Okay, I agree with you. I am a man of the rule of law, so the budget. But before the end of the budget, look for this fund\u2019. There is no fund that will be used to fund this project. And it was up to N18 billion, so he said, give it to Amaechi. Amaechi you start spending when the budget is approved. As soon as the budget was approved, she gave me money to go and start Abuja-Kaduna. But as a good man that I am, I made sure we did not forget President Goodlck Jonathan.\n\nHow are you addressing vandalism?\n\nIt is mostly between Nasarawa, Jos and some parts of the South East and then Port Harcourt. It is the law that is the problem, because the law says if you are arrested, let\u2019s say you take 10 tons of cargo and it is N10 million for instance, and the law says you will pay N200, 000, won\u2019t you take the risk? It is an old law but President Obasanjo had sent an amendment of the law to the National Assembly as far back as when he was in government and nothing has been done. We are arresting them but not much is being done. In fact, most times, the Nigerian Railway Corporation is complaining that we are paying for their feeding.\n\nThere has been a lot of controversy surrounding the Secured Anchorage Area, what is the situation now?\n\nThe president has approved the cancellation.\n\nDoes the government have the capacity to secure the country\u2019s maritime domain?\n\nWhat capacity did the company that was doing it have? You have about three to four vessels, you arrest all vessels coming to Lagos, so you say, listen, we will escort you to Lagos, because our job is to protect you, park here, that is the anchor. So park here and we will keep you for 30 days. Meanwhile, your plan is to enter Lagos and go back the next day. The first day you pay $2500, the next day you pay $1500. $1500 multiplied by 29 days plus $2500 that made it 30 days. You are carting away a $100 and something million for doing nothing. So I kept quiet so that they wouldn\u2019t accuse me of taking away their business. When I finished with the deep blue project, I called him and said, it is time for you to leave. He said why, I said because we now have the capacity to protect our waters.\n\nNIMASA has provided that capacity of having more vessels. I am just coming from a NIMASA programme and I saw the vessels, so we have them now. He said, okay what do we do, can\u2019t you hire us? I said why am I hiring you, for what? I have the equipment. I have the personnel, what am I hiring you for? So the battle started again, just like the foreign people who are petitioning now. The president set up a committee, one headed by the VP, the other headed by the minister of defence and then the EFCC.\n\nDon\u2019t forget this same issue consumed the former minister of transport. I told the president, sir, how much is in maritime? The budget in the federal ministry of transport is N6 million. That is the budget of maritime. Where the money is in the maritime is in NIMASA, NPA and all these our agencies but that is not the real money; that is not the money they are looking for.\n\nThe money they are looking for is illegal money inside maritime. When I read what a former chief of naval staff wrote against me, I laughed. I am sure he didn\u2019t want me to address it publicly. What is the interest of the former chief of naval staff? Okay, what about NNPC? There are actors that cause confusion in the waters and go to NNPC to ask for security contracts. If you aggregate all the monies that non-state actors are diverting, vis-a-vis the ones that state actors are diverting, you will see that Nigeria is bleeding more from the non-state actors than state actors. In that case, I said I was ready to die on this matter. When NIMASA paid $20 million to the company, the company from day one said our account, our company \u2013 we are in Seychelles. So once they saw an official transfer from NIMASA to the company in Seychelles, they petitioned against me. They said they have caught Amaechi. I wonder why they have not released the report since. Before I went to the president, they had started this fight amongst themselves on how to share their money. One of them went to the newspaper and said he gave the presidency 8 million dollars, National Assembly 10 million dollars.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the president was convinced that something was wrong. He felt that the level of corruption going on needed to be checked, because who pays the money? It was not transport, it was not the federal government. It was because of that money they were adding. If a camera is $10 dollars in Ghana, because they have added $500 on that camera, the owner will pass it back to you ordinary Nigerian. So who are the people being cheated? The ordinary Nigerians! The president realised that the ordinary Nigerians were being cheated. First, there was no contract, it was just them harassing poor people like us. What they had was an understanding with the navy. So I wrote to the navy and said it was not the responsibility of them or anybody on earth to decide what was an anchorage area. The law says the honourable minister of transport will. I therefore said I did not give it an anchorage area. So the president has solved it.\n\nNow, INTELS. The federal government is believed to have lost several billions since INTELS took NPA to court over the pilotage contract a year ago. But recently, the FG announced plans to award the contract for another 25 years to the same INTELS that was disqualified for violating bidding rules for contracts? Does that make sense?\n\nThere are two answers. The first answer is, it will be sub judice since it is one of the issues before the panel of investigation. The second answer is, ask the NPA whether they followed due process in proceeding with it. There is a process. You must come to the ministry of transport, and they didn\u2019t come for the bidding process. So I wrote to them and said no, I don\u2019t agree, that they didn\u2019t follow the process. And I also wrote to the president and he approved.\n\nIt appears you were not briefed on the INTELS matter. INTELS built two berths at Onne Port for $2.5 billion and it was amortised for 10 years. But the contract didn\u2019t speak to who collects revenue. INTELS\u2019s argument is therefore that they built the berth, so they must collect the revenue from the pilotage contract, which is a different agreement to offset the debt. But the NPA said anyone could collect revenue as long as the debt is paid. But INTELS has collected the revenue for over 10 years at 38% from the government, then, the balance goes to offsetting the debt. How do you reconcile this?\n\nFor all those issues, let NPA and INTELS sit down and iron it out. NPA doesn\u2019t agree with INTELS\u2019s standard. What the president is interested in is what is lawful and what is right. But again, as I said, this matter would be sub judice; it is before a panel.\n\nIs it true that the suspension of the former NPA has to do with the fallout from the INTELS matter and the Lagos Channel Management contract?\n\nDid you see the letter that was approved by the president? We never ever mentioned INTELS. We never ever knew there was a crisis between INTELS and NPA. When the NPA wrote to me, I didn\u2019t even know they were proceeding, because I wrote that you couldn\u2019t proceed. There were two contracts that I told NPA that they couldn\u2019t proceed with. The first one is this and the second one is the channel management. In writing, I told NPA that you are spending N57 billion a year for channel management, why not buy the equipment. Those white men don\u2019t use white people to do this thing, they use Nigerians to do it. The difference is the equipment, which you can\u2019t go to the market and buy. They\u2019ll say because I am Nigerian they won\u2019t sell to you. So buy the equipment and come and do it here.\n\nSince 2019, they ignored me, until it was critical. That is the argument they are making now that it is too critical. We can\u2019t afford to buy it now. Before we can finish the process to buy the equipment, it will take us two or three years. But I knew about it. I wrote to you in 2019 to say that I would not support this contract, because I thought Nigerians could do it. Now, the contract has got to N104 billion for all the channels by their bidding process. And I said I won\u2019t send it to the cabinet, because for me, why do I have to buy that cloth in London if it is here? I said they should not renew the channel contract. Don\u2019t forget that what most ministers like is this kind of situation, where contracts are expiring in their time. I could have just renewed it and collected some of the contract. But from day one, I said no; that we must move forward. We will save this country money. The first year, it may even be more than N57 billion to buy the equipment, so you buy the equipment, you deliver it. Let\u2019s even say it is N90 billion, next year you will only pay salaries. To be paying N57 billion every year for 15 years, Nigeria is bleeding.\n\nBut it was alleged that you declined to take it to cabinet because you recommended two Chinese firms and the NPA turned you down.\n\nDo you know me very well? If you know me very well, you will know that I will never call any of my agencies and recommend a contractor. Even as a governor, I didn\u2019t call my commissioners to say they should go and give a job to somebody. Just like president Buhari gave me a free hand to run my ministry, that is the way I gave everybody a free hand to run their agencies. But do you really think as the minister in charge, they would not concede to me if I asked for two from the contracts? That must be a joke. The truth is, I was not interested but just wanted the right thing to be done. Period!\n\nYou suspended Hadiza in March and up till now, the committee has still not finished. Is the delay intentional?\n\nI did not suspend Hadiza nor did I recommend her suspension. If you read the letter, the letter stated to the president, \u2018Mr President, I am the minister for transport, I don\u2019t know what is happening in NPA. Not one day have they reported to me or told me what is going on. Mr President, I would like to know what is going on. I want an audit.\u2019 The president approved. From nowhere, the auditor general refused because that is his power. So I wrote the president that I no longer want an audit, I want to do what they call administrative enquiry. But let the Managing Director of NPA just step aside. So that is not suspension, in civil service they say, you are hereby suspended. And she is not under investigation. The MD of NPA, Hadiza Bala-Usma, is not under investigation; it is NPA that is being investigated.\n\nBut it has taken seven months to carry out an administrative inquiry without a report.\n\nThe panel has not finished. They are investigating five years. One year alone will take them 10 months. But have it at the back of your mind that all we are doing is going through what happened in NPA for the five years that I never knew anything about NPA.\n\nAre you likely to recall her?\n\nI am not the president. That is the decision for the president. I will only send the panel report to the president. If the president is convinced that she should come back, so be it. If you look at the NPA law, only the president has the powers to fire or hire. The minister doesn\u2019t have any power to hire.\n\nIt was said that you instigated her suspension because both of you were not working well and you have just insinuated it too by saying you didn\u2019t know what was happening in NPA.\n\nIf you know me well, I am a very busy administrator. I like smart people around me. They do all the work, I get the credit. So there is no way you will say I will be angry with the MD of NPA if she was doing her job according to the law. And the law includes the fact that you should come to the minister for approvals. There is something we are querying now in NPA, I just saw the file yesterday and I asked the permanent secretary to brief me. I don\u2019t know if I should tell you this, but let me give you an example. We had an agreement with Lekki Deep Seaport. The permanent secretary said an unknown person went and entered into a second agreement without the knowledge of the ministry. Meanwhile, the minister doesn\u2019t have the power for such an agreement. The right thing is to go to the cabinet. I saw it yesterday and I read it once and read it the second time. But how do you sit in an office and somebody in NPA, whoever the person is, goes to drop a second agreement with Lekki Deep Seaport? And it has to do with exclusivity.\n\nYou said NPA is being investigated and not Hadiza, yet, you reported to the president that funds were not being remitted to the federation account, even when the ED F&A, who was a key figure in the NPA management, was appointed to Act pending the outcome of the investigation. How do you even explain that away?\n\nWhy not wait till the report is out? You have a structure, where the Managing Director of NPA is in charge of most of the issues. If today the ED finance has not remitted funds, whose responsibility is it to call me? If I want to see anybody in NPA, I don\u2019t go to Koko, all I need to do is to say, \u2018Perm Sec, tell the MD of NPA to see me.\u2019 I have friends in NIMASA, even when they come once, they raise NIMASA issues. I just tell them to go to the DG. That is the structure, just like the president does. If the president is asking everybody in transport, how will I run my ministry? So if you say I did not hold Koko responsible, there are two things that will happen: I am holding NPA responsible for not remitting funds, whoever is in charge should tell me who is not doing their job. If the panel says Koko didn\u2019t do his job, then, he will go.\n\nEven at that, it still doesn\u2019t smell nice that Koku is the acting MD when a panel is investigating NPA at a time he was the ED finance. Does it?\n\nThe management of NPA was not dissolved. I don\u2019t have such powers. Only the president can dissolve the management and board.\n\nRecently, you said Nigeria was the only country in the world where shipowners have no ship and the shipowners have replied you. They said you didn\u2019t know what you were saying. But what did you mean by that statement?\n\nOkay, let\u2019s even say it is true, tell me one Nigerian that\u2019s Ocean going? They all do carbotage. Finish! Again, I am the minister of transport, maybe I misspoke. What I mean by I misspoke is that I should be protecting my people; I should not be putting them out there. But if they want that debate, let\u2019s have a meeting on that. They know I know the people I spoke about. They have told me themselves.\n\nStill on shipowners, the Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF) was designed to help Nigerians who don\u2019t have ocean-going vessels. Recently, you were quoted to have said the government had withdrawn the approval of the disbursement of the Fund. And the shipowners said you were not correct. From their own investigation, the approval has not been withdrawn. The question is, has the approval been withdrawn? If it has been withdrawn, how then do you develop the sector?\n\nI will go back to the president. It took us three years to get approval from the president, because there were so many interests. The president minuted to the attorney general, who then advised that it was not public money; that it was money belonging to those who do business in maritime, especially shipowners and that it is held in trust by government. That the government should disburse to them, and the president approved. Then, we sent it to the ministry of finance, asking them to release the money according to the law to a specific bank, without telling us (ministry of finance), they wrote back to the president and said it was public money.\n\nBut NIMASA has been doing Cabotage waiver for foreign players, which the law forbids.\n\nWhen did NIMASA do that? Please can you show me because that ends with the minister and I have never signed any of them?\n\nSo if there is no cabotage waiver how are the foreigners operating in the industry?\n\n(NIMASA DG, Badhir Jamoh, who was present, interjects\u2026) \u201cWe don\u2019t give a waiver. There are two issues, one, only the minister can give waiver and NIMASA has a duty to process the waiver. So if you are a shipping company, you apply for a waiver and we process it. And when we process it, we send it to the minister. But the pattern and the main way the ministers operate, they don\u2019t want to give the waivers. So usually most ministers, if they come, they don\u2019t attend to those applications. But NIMASA continues to file in the applications on the processing of the waiver. The owners of those waivers assume once they pay and they have a receipt, they will go and continue trading. This matter went to the National Assembly, it called us and said we were giving waivers.\n\n\u201cWe said we don\u2019t give waivers. We said give us the evidence where we issued a waiver, and they didn\u2019t have. The person responsible for waiver is the minister; this is what the act says. So they called the minister and he said, call the DG NIMASA; I have never given approval. When these two contradictory statements came, I now went to NIMASA and said all application forms received in respect of waiver and processed, send it to the honourable minister. If he doesn\u2019t want to give, let him send it to us that he does not want to give. And that is the position till today.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the railway. The frequency of breakdowns of the locomotives has cast doubt on the quality of what you have. Aren\u2019t you concerned too?\n\nYou are right about breakdowns, and it happened only in Kaduna-Abuja. But from 2016 till now, we have not replaced anything. We have run out of rolling stock. It is good to be a governor. As a governor, I can go and buy the rolling stock, but here, I have to advertise; I have to get approval from the president. The president gave me approval about four or five months ago. I have to do what you people refer to as due process. If I don\u2019t do it, it will be on the front pages of the newspapers. So we are doing the due process to go and buy rolling stock. Rolling stock has been there since 2016 . We don\u2019t have enough anymore to recover or to keep the rail running. If some are bad, we replace them and they move. So we will continue to have breakdowns. You should even praise Nigerian engineers. Recently, we have never had any breakdown. They fixed the rail after the attack. It was a young lady engineer that did it. I thanked her and said Nigerian media will not see this.\n\nStill, a lot of people are attributing the breakdowns to poor quality\n\nJust imagine that you have not eaten for four or six years, will you still be alive? So I said until we buy those rolling stocks, I don\u2019t know whether it will be bought while I am in office, because of the due process. Because at the end of the due process, I still have to go to the cabinet. Take Lagos-Ibadan, if it is a state governor, it is easy but we are doing due process and it took us over six months to get this thing from ICRC. Now that we have got it, we are advertising it and we will give them six weeks, then, we will start our own internal due process.\n\nWhen we finish, then, we\u2019ll go to the cabinet. In fact, when we came to government at the beginning of 2016, the majority of members of cabinet were of the view that they should give us some emergency powers. But then people screamed, and they stepped that idea down. But if we had those emergency powers, all we need to do is to call, say, a Chinese company to supply us what we need. But because we have to do due process, it takes time.\n\nLet\u2019s play some politics. The All Progressives Congress (APC) is conflicted seriously in Rivers, and your friend, Magnus Abe is at loggerheads with your own faction in the state.\n\nIf you call an APC meeting now in Rivers State, who would you call? The law simply says there is a national APC, and the national APC sends people to organise primaries. If somebody says he is a parallel APC, he is on his own. It is like saying, because I established one oil company, I am now the NNPC.\n\nWhat will it take for the crisis in Rivers APC to be resolved?\n\nI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even know there is a crisis in Rivers APC, because I am a member of Rivers APC, but I am not the chairman of APC in Rivers State neither am I the secretary.\n\nBut you are a central figure in the party and also in the thick of the crisis.\n\nThe question is, what are these issues? Am I running to be a governor, apart from being a former governor of Rivers State, I can\u2019t be Rivers state governor again. The law forbids that, however, I can be governor of Ogun State, but I can\u2019t be governor of Rivers State again. So I am not among those in contention. You should ask those parties that are contending for the governorship of Rivers State.\n\nAre you not worried that what happened in 2019 as a result of your scuffle with Senator Abbe could repeat itself in 2023, if you do not come together?\n\nHow will it happen? If they repeat what they did the last time, you will see what will happen. They were celebrating the last time. No known politician will allow what happened the last time to happen again. They went to court. Have you seen a situation where even a judge asked a party to a matter to come and was pointing their lawyer to them? The party refused and said it was not their lawyer. The last time we didn\u2019t speak because we wanted to respect institutions, Now, this is the last lap.\n\nYou will say to yourself, how will it happen again? I don\u2019t know how it will happen, I am not God, but I know that I am not in conflict with anybody in the party in the state.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the last time the court judgment came and the Supreme Court said, you people should go home and make peace. I came to the party in the state and I rallied everybody. And I said gentlemen, no victor, no vanquished, let everybody come together, we don\u2019t need to make trouble and all that. But just because I said me, Chibuike Amaechi will support a riverine candidate, the trouble started again. So until somebody is made governor of Rivers State, you are not at peace? You can only be a good man when that man is made governor? They are denying me my right in choosing who I want to support. And I have said whether they like it or not, the whole Rivers State can go upland, for me, justice is served if I support a riverine man.\n\nWhy? Upland has been governor for 20 years, which is unfair. If Wike is the best governor, there can be another Wike in the riverine. So upland, allow these riverine people even if it is four years. And you can take the power from the riverine, any day you wake up and say I want back power. You will take it so easily. There are 18 local governments in the riverine area and 15 upland and, Ikwere alone has 2 million votes as at the time I left. So any day, Ikwere wakes up and say, we want back our power, they can do it. But allow what is fair and just; allow them governorship and that\u2019s all I said. In fact, I say I don\u2019t have a candidate, whatever candidate you people bring from the riverine, I will support. That is the quarrel in Rivers State APC.\n\nDo you think APC, as it stands today in Rivers, has what it takes to challenge a Governor Wike-led PDP?\n\nWait until the elections. The last time, how did he defeat us? They used government institutions to defeat us.\n\nNo, that\u2019s not correct, minister. You were alleged to have used the military to try to take power\n\nI did not use the military. I did not even know there was military at Abonnema. I swear to God. I\u2019m not joking. When I heard about the shooting at Abonnema, then, I asked: what happened at Abonnema that you people went there to shoot? That\u2019s when I heard that a military officer, protecting INEC\u2019s materials was standing like this; a lieutenant Colonel in the army, and you were courageous enough to shoot him?\n\nWho shot him?\n\nWhichever Thugs. The man slumped and died, then, the military immediately opened fire to save themselves.\n\nBut there was a body of women, protesting?\n\nPlease, please, could they come out? Can any woman come out in that kind of situation? They came out after and said they were demonstrating. What sort of demonstration? Even a policeman, you can\u2019t past the policemen. But you see an army officer guarding INEC\u2019s materials and you opened fire? Did they tell you that they went to Obi Akpo? A sitting government, shot an army Colonel and took Obi Akpo\u2019s results? Did they tell you that? You know one thing about our journalists? Before you write, always make proper investigation.\n\nDo you really want us to believe that..?\n\nThat is what happened, I did not not use the military\n\nLet me take you back to the rail issue. You are the man in charge of the railway today at the national level, looking back at your time in Rivers State, you started a monorail of about 1.5 kilometres in length that you could not complete. How does that make you feel?\n\nIt\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s about 5.3 kilometres not 1.5 kilometres. The only thing remaining for that rail to be completed was the last station, that required less than N1 billion to complete. The problem is, when you pick young boys and give them what they cannot carry\u2026Listen, I don\u2019t want to go into that. Truth is, we have finished the tracks, we bought the coaches and locomotives. It was the consultant that advised us to extend it to the last station so that more trains can come and park. We awarded the contract for about N1billion or N2 billion. But the man there refused to complete it. What about the schools that they stopped? We will talk about all these during the election. Now, I am obeying my lawyers and publicist who have advised me not to talk. I am writing a book, Nigerians will know more when the book is released.\n\nYour party has been in power for over six years and the country is a mess now.\n\nWho told you that? I disagree with you\n\nThe statistics are there: insecurity everywhere, the economy is paralysed. Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world under your party. No one can travel by road anymore, yet, you think the APC is a big deal?\n\nThat is not true. When my CSO died, I drove from Abuja to Asaba. I have told you when we were discussing that the reason for Boko Haram is not religion, it is not Muslims looking for Christians; it is basically the fact that there was a lack of education and poverty. Until we address that, the challenges will remain with us. Now, take for instance, I say go and open this station in Borno, they will say Amaechi is Hausa-Fulani man. You have forgotten that the reason is that some areas in the north tend to be poorer than some areas in the south. And there is a need for us as a country to balance out. You must balance out deliberately. Government must make deliberate efforts to do this.\n\nLook, if you make me president tomorrow, I am going to run free education especially, in the north. Let the government fund free education, because the same people you are denying free education today are the people that are not allowing you to rest. There is no boundary for kidnapping, even the herdsmen you are talking about, we must find strategic measures to deal with the issue. You can\u2019t just say don\u2019t come to Rivers, or don\u2019t come to Ogun State, no. The governors must meet as a people and say the reason why this is happening is XYZ. We will agree that we will partner the federal government to do the following and find solutions to them. Now, there are only two places people go to in Nigeria. There are 36 states and the FCT, but only two are functional \u2013 Abuja and Lagos. And why you are functional here (Lagos) is because of the federal government. The federal government will rather die than have anything happen to Lagos because of our economy.\n\nThen, Abuja the same. Why are other places abandoned?\n\nYou and I, the rich men, when we are stealing the money that belongs to the people, didn\u2019t we know? It has got to a point where access to public funds is no longer possible, because Buhari stopped people from getting access to public funds, except you do project. There is always a choice we have to make between infrastructure development and just spending the money recklessly. At other times, we\u2019ve been reckless with our expenditures. We have never addressed infrastructure. I remember what the president asks me all the time, he says, \u201cAmaechi, when you go to Cape Town, how do you feel?\u201d I say I feel ashamed. Cape Town looks like overseas. When you go to Cape Town, you won\u2019t believe it is a South African environment. So for him, he wants a replication of Cape Town in all parts of Nigeria. He thinks that we can build railways everywhere no matter how bad it is.\n\nAnd I continue to remember the question he asked me, \u201cAmaechi if those people, who were heads of state by that time we had money, had done this railroad, would we be doing railroad now?\u201d No. We have been reckless with our funding. To address what you said, poverty is the basic factor for the issue of kidnapping, the issue of insecurity and all that. When I was governor of Rivers State, there was one statement I made clearly and I still maintain that. I said because few governments and Nigerian elites refused to provide a legal economy for the poor, the poor will provide for themselves an illegal economy. What I am trying to say is that poverty did not start with Buhari\u2019s government. What I said was that, what is happening today started long ago. If we all went to school, we would not be looking for employment.\n\nBy the time there was this Tunisian revolution, everybody was educated in Tunisia. If we took time to put people in school, train them, then, you will have manpower.\n\nLet me say this here, that all these railways we are building, what are we carrying? We did not create this poverty that people are blaming us for, it is just that the poverty showed in our time in office. If the poverty had tarried a bit, we would have finished our tenure and leave, and the next government would have suffered it. Buhari came and inherited it but he realised that the way to address it is not by sharing the little money we have, it is to provide infrastructure. If that infrastructure is able to provide employment, we would not be here, because everybody will be at work. I will repeat what I used to say those days. If all of us are working in Shell, would we have time to go and steal? You will be at work, and by 6pm, you\u2019ll go home.\n\nI will give you another example. There is one of my friends, he kept telling me that his wife was giving him problems. And I said what is the problem? He said she used to ask where are you, where did you go to? I said I have the solution, he said what is the solution? Is she employed, he said no. I said bring her. We gave her a job and now, when she gets home by 6pm, she sleeps off. Even if the husband comes back by 2am she does not know because at 6am she is awake rushing to work. He told me ah! Now that there is peace in his house. So when you say there is poverty and insecurity, it is not because our government is reckless; it is because we inherited poverty. There is crime because people are not engaged.\n\nWe inherited $2.5 billion in excess crude account, which was between $50 and $60 billion that Obasanjo left. They said, oh, the governors said they should pay them. What they paid us was only $10 billion, how did we say they should share the money? The constitution says you must hold an economic council meeting minimum of once a month. We came for the first month, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said we have spent $1 billion, the president approved. Next month, the president approved, third month, and the fourth month. This money is for the local government, state and federal, he can\u2019t be approving for himself alone, let him approve for us too. We fought and fought and they disbursed $10 billion, in which they still took 56% and we took the remaining.\n\nSo what happened to the difference? The day they were leaving the government, what was left for President Buhari was $2.5 billion. I am speaking as a former chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum. Nobody will accuse me of divulging government information, because this is privileged information I got to know. What was the first problem that confronted us? If you don\u2019t give states money to pay salaries, there would be revolution in Nigeria. To avoid that revolution, states were given money, but don\u2019t forget there was no money. We are not magicians. You should praise Buhari. This insecurity and poverty were created before we came. Nigerians want to know how you are handling it, they don\u2019t want to know where it started from.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the burning issue of power shift. Many prominent northern figures are saying it is not by threatening that the heavens will fall that power will shift. That what the south should do is to negotiate power moving to their region. What\u2019s your view on this?\n\nIs there anywhere you play politics without negotiation? Even if they didn\u2019t say power shift, even if they say the North should produce the president, the man who wants to be president, won\u2019t he negotiate? Listen, Nigeria is such a big country, there is no place called South or North or East or West, it is all about interest. I tell people that when the Igbo, Ikwere and Hausa are sharing money, do you hear North or South? You only hear it when the sharing is not favourable. It is an elitist thing. The illiterate southerner and the poor northerner do not know that the rich northerner is colluding with the rich southerner to deny them opportunities. In fact, I always say that the day these two people will come together, all the elites will run away.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think it is an issue. I just think that the politics of merit, the politics of national interest should be above other considerations, because we must know that this country has to be one, it is not at all costs but there is benefit in being one. Market is by size, the problem today why our market is not important to anybody is because we don\u2019t have the purchasing power. The day everybody has the purchasing power, even those who said they are killing here will come here to be killed. But unfortunately, many Nigerian can\u2019t purchase things. What can you purchase and where is the money? You are hearing today, North, South, East and West because there is no purchasing power.\n\nThe reason you are seeing all the ills is the economy is not working. Mind you, it is not by Buhari; it started before he came. Don\u2019t forget that when he was head of state in 1983, he inherited a similar situation from Shagari. So you are hearing power shift because the elites are talking about how to share power and share the wealth of the country. It is beyond just power shift, it is a thing that you must say to yourself; if I take this action now, will the country divide? You must consider the issue of national interest. Will there be insecurity? Will the people suffer? There is no politics without negotiation.\n\nDo you think you have what it takes to be the president of Nigeria?\n\nThat is a more difficult question to answer. And I will tell you why. Whatever capacity I deployed in Rivers State, still exists in me. One of the things I heard before I became governor of Rivers State was that, \u2018he is too young, he is too rascally.\u2019 But when I came, within six months, the kidnappers were on the run. I am the first Nigerian to call them criminals. Look at what they are doing, they are killing people, and if you kill people, are you not a criminal? You see, government has the coercive capacity to put anybody down, it depends on whether you want to deploy it or not. So being president is not an issue, I should focus on the responsibilities I have been given.\n\nWhat are the attributes you want the next president of Nigeria to have?\n\nThe next president must first ensure that we have a united country. These elites must leave him alone to do his job, because the problem we have is that the elites are causing problem. Before, you had a Nigeria where people just gather because someone has just turned 50 and you spend $1 million dollars that could have been used to open an industry and employ people. I just spoke to you how the maritime sector is a problem to us. As speaker, 40% of my friends were Yoruba. There was no Yoruba speaker that was not my friend when I was a speaker. There was nothing like you are a northerner or a southerner, we were just comrades and friends.\n\nIn 2015, your party proposed three things, economy, corruption and security. In 2019, it reinforced the same thing and incidentally you were the campaign DG in both instances. Can you rate your party on these accounts?\n\nI rate us 90 per cent. Let\u2019s start with security, it could have been worse. When we came, states were unable to pay salaries. At that time, only Rivers State and Lagos could pay salaries. Out of 36 you are talking of 34 states that would have been on fire. And don\u2019t forget we went into recession. Pundits, World Bank said it would take three years for Buhari to come out of recession. But it took him one year; in fact, it took him nine months. It is in this government that two past governors were jailed.\n\nPre-2015, your relationship with President Buhari. What is it now and what kind of man is he?\n\nIt\u2019s the same. The only difference is now you have a president. Before I could joke and say, \u201cOga you know I am the campaign DG, everybody should obey the DG.\u201d He would laugh and say, \u201cOkay, oga DG, you are the power man; go ahead.\u201d Now, go and tell him you are the DG and he will ask you who is the president. He may crack a joke, a lot of people don\u2019t know him. He jokes a lot. The only time you will not see the president crack jokes or laugh when you are cracking jokes is when a visitor enters, then, he takes his military discipline and keeps quiet, because he is a very quiet man. But the moment the visitor goes and he is in his natural environment, he will laugh. He is now the president, but beyond that, our relationship has been smooth.\n\nBut people say you have lost out in the power game\n\nWas there power?\n\nBut your access to the Villa is said to have been restricted. Are you denying that?\n\nMe?\n\nYes, there are rumours that you have lost out in the power game. Isn\u2019t it true?\n\nI didn\u2019t know there was a Villa power game. Honestly, I see the president anytime I want to see the president. I shouldn\u2019t be saying this, but I see the president anytime. All I need do is to inform his office that I\u2019d like to see the president and they will tell the president, \u201cAmaechi wants to see you,\u201d and he will give them appointment. I have never been stopped from seeing him.\n\nLastly, what do think about Nigeria? Do you think the people have a future together as a nation?\n\nHow can anyone suggest that and we are still here? When we graduated from the University of Port Harcourt, a lot of my classmates ran overseas, some of them are sending text messages now asking when they will come and see me. Nigeria is a land of opportunities. Just remain, work hard, be patient, pray hard and God will answer you. This is a virgin land in terms of agriculture. We have 200 million persons, just start a farm, feed only 10 million and see how rich you will be. The thing is, we want quick money. NNPC, bring this money and all that. When I retire, I am heading straight to the farm. If you feed 1 million persons with poultry at $1, how much is it? Nobody wants to do anything. We just want to see Buhari, Amaechi or Wike. Just start something small; don\u2019t go big at first, before you know it, you are big. You sell and make money. Nigeria is a land of opportunities; we should all work together and make this country great.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Unveils \u2018100 for 100\u2019 Policy",
          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unveiled selection criteria for private sector companies to participate in its new financial instrument tagged, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d which was announced last week\n\nIn a two-page notice signed by its Development Finance Department, that was obtained by THISDAY yesterday, the central bank explained that the selection criteria for participation would be premised on the business\u2019 immediate contribution to economic growth, jobs creation, and social impact.\n\nIt pointed out that in selecting the companies, evidence -based, transparent and measurable criteria shall be deployed.\n\nAccording to the central bank, the move was to ensure the operational framework for a robust and transparent process for identifying and selecting high-impact companies and projects under its 100 for 100 PPP.\n\n\u201cThese are projects that must catalyse sustainable employment-led economic growth through increased domestic production and productivity in the near term.\n\n\u201cThe projects for consideration shall be new projects in existing companies requiring new machinery and other support and must have the greatest potential to achieve significant scale in their in-country production and for domestic consumption and exports,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe CBN restated that the broad objective of introducing the instrument was to reverse the nation\u2019s over-reliance in imports, by creating a platform that targets and supports the right companies and projects with potential to immediately transform and jumpstart the productive base of the economy.\n\nShedding more light on the initiative, the CBN stated that the instrument shall provide naira intervention funding under existing CBN intervention processes and complete foreign exchange funding for new machinery.\n\n\u201cThis instrument is for only new projects; will not cover any refinance of existing facilities and will be subject to independent evaluation by international audit firms.\n\n\u201cAll intervention under this project will be made public and published in national dailies.

The event is expected to pull a crowd of Nigerian and French investors, government and business leaders, diplomats and the media in the hope of showcasing opportunities on both sides as well as bringing enlightenment to bear on the prevailing security, economic and investment climate in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari is expected back in the country after the engagements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Ajodo's ID Card number is 001.\n\nThe ID Card was signed by Abubakar Malami (SAN), Attorney-General of the Federation.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the Chief Magistrate of Wuse Zone 6 Magisterial Division in Abuja, Emmanuel Iyanna, admitted that he was lied to, which made him sign the search warrant allowing the invasion of the residence of the Supreme Court judge, Mary Odili.\n\nIyanna had said he was misled by the Federal Ministry of Justice under Malami. See Also Legal How Attorney-General, Malami\u2019s Ministry Misled Me To Sign Warrant To Raid Supreme Court Judge, Odili\u2019s Residence \u2013 Chief Magistrate\n\nThe Chief magistrate consequently revoked the search warrant due to misrepresentation in the first information application supplied by an ad hoc public asset recovery panel domiciled under the justice ministry and overseen by Malami.\n\n\u201cUpon misrepresentation to this honourable court that led to the issuance of a search warrant in favour of Joint Panel Recovery, Ministry of Justice, against House 9, Imo Street, Maitama, Abuja, dated October 29, 2021; in view of the above fact, the said search warrant is hereby revoked,\u201d he had ruled.\n\nArmed operatives had stormed Odili\u2019s residence bearing a warrant that was issued based on information from a whistle-blower, Aliyu Umar, an Abuja-based resident.\n\nUmar had deposed on October 13 that illegal activities were going on at 9, Imo Street, Maitama which should warrant immediate action from law enforcement agents.\n\nOdili is next in line to Nigeria\u2019s Chief Justice, Tanko Muhammad and stands to benefit from his removal should that happen before her retirement on May 12, 2022.\n\nSources said the raid, approved by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) was to let her know she would not be allowed to succeed Muhammad as the head of the nation\u2019s judiciary. See Also Scandal EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason Why Buhari Presidency Cabal Ordered Raid On Home Of Ex-Rivers Governor Odili's Wife, Justice Mary Odili\n\nOdili, who was appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court on June 23, 2011, was born on May 12, 1952. This means she will be due for retirement by May 12, 2022, on turning 70.\n\nBut Muhammad, who was appointed a supreme court judge in 2006 and sworn in on January 8, 2007, was born on December 31, 1953 \u2014 meaning he is younger than Justice Odili and will not retire until 2023 when he turns 70.\n\nAnother source said, \u201cRegarding the raid on Odili's House, it was planned because they don\u2019t want her to become the next CJN. Though she\u2019s retiring in about six months, that is like six years to the cabal. They are planning to remove Tanko Muhammad before then and don\u2019t want the woman to even act as CJN for one day.\n\n\u201cThe most senior Justice after Odili is Olukayode Ariwoola but they claim he\u2019s got a terminal illness. He is expected to retire soon on health grounds. The fourth most senior of the Justices who could take over as CJN is Musa Dattijo Muhammad, another Northerner from Niger State. He is also expected to retire in 2023.\n\n\u201cThey accused Odili of being a PDP (opposition party - Peoples Democratic Party) judge and that her husband helps to fix lots of judgements at their home in Abuja. That was why the husband was also embarrassed recently.\n\n\u201cForget also about Malami\u2019s denials, he was directly in charge of the raid. He chose the day President Muhammadu Buhari arrived from Saudi Arabia to do it because he needed to impress Buhari that he is still loyal as efforts are being intensified to remove him as Minister.\n\n\u201cThey want to force Tanko out soon and don\u2019t want the woman to replace him. They considered her too close to the PDP, so they have to embarrass her to ensure she doesn't get to replace him at all.\u201d",

          "text": "An investigation by Premium Times has revealed how President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi illegally approved a huge national security-sensitive maritime contract to a medical company.\n\nThe development has reportedly unsettled those in power as senior officials trade accusations of bad faith while the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) complained of \u201cprocedural lapses\u201d in memos that only stopped short of directly accusing Buhari and Amaechi of lawlessness.\n\nThe procurement agency had said the contract was awarded in clear breach of the Public Procurement Act 2007.\n\nAccording to one of the memos obtained by the newspaper, the International Cargo Tracking Note (ICTN) scheme is an electronic cargo verification system that monitors the shipment of seaborne cargo and enables a real-time generation of vital data on ship and cargo traffic in and out of Nigeria.\n\nAn operation of the scheme was in effect following a contract between the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and an operator, TPMS-Antaser-Afrique during the Umaru Musa Yar'Adua administration, however, it was abruptly terminated by the former finance minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, in October 2011.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the termination of the contract ended up in a court of arbitration and was investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nAccording to Okonjo-Iweala, the scheme was hurting businesses. However, the Nigerian Ports Authority argued that within the short period it was initially implemented, barely a year, more than 40 million euros were generated in revenue. It is, however, unclear if that revenue was remitted to the government in full.\n\nMeanwhile, several years later, the government now finds the scheme desirable again. A transport ministry memo of August 26, 2021, to the Bureau of Public Procurement, says that non-engagement of the scheme would continue to cause the country loss of revenue, worsen the country\u2019s maritime security situation, and allow alteration of cargoes and under-declaration.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by the newspaper, Amaechi\u2019s transport ministry had on September 11, 2020, sought the approval of the BPP to conduct a restricted/selected tendering exercise to engage agents or partners for the implementation of the cargo tracking note scheme.\n\nBut citing the \u201cconvoluted\u201d circumstance of the initial contract, which attracted criminal investigation by the EFCC and the need to regain international confidence, the BPP rejected the selective tender request and, instead, asked the transport ministry to conduct international competitive bidding (ICB).\n\n\u201cThis (ICB) was to ensure that experienced international firms with high reputation, integrity, and capacity to deliver participate in the procurement process,\u201d BPP said in an October 22, 2020 memo justifying the need for an openly competitive process.\n\nBut \u201csurprisingly,\u201d the BPP noted in a memo, the transport ministry on August 26, 2021, reverted to the public procurement regulator with approval dated August 19, 2021, from the president to adopt a direct procurement in favour of MedTech Scientific Limited, a healthcare company, in partnership with Rozi International Nigeria Limited, a property development company.\n\nDirect procurement is single sourcing of a contractor with no room for competition either in a selective exercise, which invites interests from a restricted number of companies based on experience and capacity, or an open exercise, which is publicly advertised for companies to express interest and compete.\n\nAfter the October 22, 2020 letter of the BPP rejecting the selective tendering exercise the ministry of transport initially requested, Amaechi ceased further communication with the bureau until he was able to circumvent due process to obtain Mr Buhari\u2019s approval for direct procurement, which he then communicated to the bureau on August 27, 2021.\n\nIn the period between October 2020 and August 2021, the President, in a letter dated May 17, 2021, directed that an international competitive bidding exercise be adopted in line with the BPP\u2019s earlier position.\n\nBut Amaechi brushed aside the instructions of the president and the BPP and went ahead to have the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council, where the tracking note scheme is now domiciled, commence a restricted tendering exercise extending invitations to nine companies.\n\nThis was done because of time constraints, the ministry claimed in the memo of August 27 to the BPP. Curiously, the same president changed his position afterwards and did not only authorise to use selective tendering but in favour of two named companies.\n\nThat procedure contravened Section 40(1) of the Public Procurement Act 2007 as there was no approval from the Bureau before adopting Restricted Tendering Exercise, the BPP said in two separate memos to the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari, and the ministry of transportation\u2019s permanent secretary, Magdalene Ajani.\n\nWhile the restricted tendering exercise, which the BPP said was illegal, was ongoing, Amaechi decided to jettison the process and consequently \u201chand-picked\u201d MedTech Scientific Limited, in partnership with Rozi International Nigeria Limited, out of the firms selected to compete for the contract.\n\nHe then sought and obtained Buhari\u2019s anticipatory approval to engage MedTech without any competition, a development that was inconsistent with the president\u2019s earlier directive and the public procurement law.\n\n\u201cThis procedure is clearly against the spirit and intent of the Public Procurement Act 2007 and if challenged has the potential to embarrass the government,\u201d the BPP said in a memo to the Chief of Staff to the President, Mr Gambari. A similar position was communicated to the transport ministry but the BPP said nevertheless it could not stop the contract given the president\u2019s approval.\n\nThe BPP said the transport ministry did not provide the basis for picking MedTech and Rozi International to partner for the project. The ministry had said the companies selected to participate in the selective tendering process were chosen based on \u201cproven records of experience, competency, and reliability to execute the services.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the investigation, neither MedTech nor Rozi International had any record of success in delivering maritime traffic tracking service.\n\nMedTech was incorporated in Nigeria in 2008 with an office in Lagos. The directors are Lifesign Healthcare Limited, a UK-registered company, Ramzi Nabil Abou-Hassan, Iyabo Rojaiye, and Kolawole Ojetimi. Abou-Hassan is a health practitioner, his Linkedin profile suggests, and the managing director of Lifesign Healthcare Limited, UK Companies House records show.\n\nOn Linkedin, Abou-Hassan said of his involvement in the coast of West Africa, which covers Nigeria, that \u201cIt is our intention to continue to leverage our experience of almost 20 years in this region to help build capacity in a very difficult environment and where the level of public healthcare has suffered much neglect for over three decades.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Rozi International was incorporated in 1991 in Bauchi State, with a Wuse Abuja address, CAC records show. According to the records, the company\u2019s nature of business is property business development, and the directors, as well as shareholders, are Robert Zeitoun, and Issam Zeitoun.\n\nThe BPP said the profiles of the two companies were not forwarded for review and therefore could not comment on their \u201csuitability to execute a project of this magnitude and complexity.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear if Buhari saw the profiles of MedTech and Rozi International or questioned Amaechi in this regard before granting his approval.\n\nDespite the arbitrariness of the procurement process, the BPP said it could not stop Amaechi since he had managed to gain Buhari\u2019s anticipatory approval. An anticipatory approval means the granting of a procurement request before the statutory consideration and endorsement of the Federal Executive Council.\n\nNevertheless, the BPP separately told Buhari\u2019s Chief of Staff, Gambari, and the ministry of transport that \u201cit is not correct\u201d for the \u201cexalted Office of His Excellency, Mr President, to be drawn into routine administrative approvals particularly contract-related matters that are open to litigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis procedure should be strongly discouraged,\u201d it wrote.\n\nThe Bureau also told the Chief of Staff to advise the president to rescind his anticipatory approval granted to Amaechi to ensure an international competitive bidding exercise that is not compromised and to protect the president from embarrassment.\n\nMeanwhile, the BPP also raised a question about the required security clearance from the Office of the National Security Adviser. The NSA had expressed security concerns in a July 16, 2021, memo.\n\nIt is not certain if both Buhari and Amaechi obtained any security clearance before approving the contract to MedTech and its partner Rozi International.\n\nAmaechi has at various times got himself mired in arbitrary conduct around procurement processes involving agencies under his supervision, suggesting an aversion for due process.\n\nIn several contract processes involving the NPA, Amaechi inserted himself arbitrarily. In one case, he directed the NPA to restore a boat service contract with logistics giants, Intels, in disregard for an ongoing open bidding exercise in which the company had been disqualified.\n\nIn this case, the BPP intervened and submitted that Amaechi\u2019s position could create a monopoly and leave a pattern of gaining contracts in ways other than a transparent competitive tendering process.\n\nIn addition, in the matter of NPA\u2019s port dredging contract, Amaechi directed that contracts be extended for a year beyond original expiration dates instead of a bidding exercise, which the BPP had approved.",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNCC\u2019s grace period\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint insights on school abductions\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s H1 results\n\nAnother NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised: Nigeria\u2019s federal government has announced that it\u2019s extending the deadline for NIN-SIM linkage to the \u201cend of the year 2021.\u201d\n\nSeventh time wasn\u2019t the charm: The first deadline was in December 2020, and by our count, this marks the eighth deadline extension in eleven months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy the change of heart? In what seems to be a customary ritual, appeals by the Mobile Network Operators and other industry stakeholders were heeded in making this decision.\n\nLike the last extension, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says the government\u2019s focus is still to foster registration of Nigerians in remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, foreigners, and diplomatic missions.\n\nA smattering of progress: In July 2021, the NCC said there were 59.8 million unique NIN enrolments. Per the Commission\u2019s latest statement, the number has grown to 66 million.\n\nAlso, as of October 30, 2021, there were over 9,500 enrolment systems and over 8,000 NIN enrolment centres within and outside the country. An increase from the 5,500 enrollment systems announced in July.\n\nConsidering the government\u2019s shift in focus to remote areas, among others, the drastic increase in enrollment systems seems a welcome development. But, with only a 10% increase in unique NIN enrollments from July to October, it appears the government still has its work cut out for it.\n\nNot surprising, if you\u2019ve read this: Inside Nigeria\u2019s 13-year-old quest for widespread digital identification.\n\nShould we give the government the benefit of the doubt?\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s school children abductions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 15, 2014, scores of Nigerians woke up to some disturbing news; at around 11 p.m. on April 14, 2014, 276 girls were kidnapped from their boarding school in Chibok, Northeastern Nigeria, by Boko Haram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven years later and more than a hundred Chibok girls are said to still be in captivity.\n\nSince then, at least 1,800 school children have been abducted.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, with 11 abductions this year, more school children were kidnapped in 2021 than in previous years.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s H1 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/27998473@N02/11982286343/\u201d>jbdodane</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nSome money news: On Thursday, October 28, 2021, Airtel Africa, a subsidiary of India\u2019s Bharti-Airtel, released its results for the half-year ended 30 September 2021.\n\nAccording to Segun Ogunsaya, Airtel Africa\u2019s new CEO, \u201cOur first-half financial performance has been strong.\n\n\u201cThe first half of last year, and especially Q1, was impacted by the start of Covid, but even after adjusting for these effects, our revenue growth rates for the half-year for the Group and all our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms these are all in strong double digits.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, revenue brought in by voice still sits at the top of the pile, raking in $1.14 trillion in comparison to $972 million in September 2020.\n\nData comes in a close second with $733 million, in comparison to $548 million in the same period last year.\n\nAll of these numbers, of course, have to be looked at in the light of certain intricacies like currency change \u2014 reported and constant.\n\nIf you have a head for numbers or are just naturally curious, then you\u2019d definitely want to read our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun\u2019s careful analysis of this report.\n\nSpoiler alert: I\u2019ve gotten a sneak peek, and there are a lot of numbers.\n\nA little more context from Intelligence by Techpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari said the fear and trauma of abduction are forcing children out of school.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, Nigeria currently has more than 10 million out-of-school children, mostly due to insecurity in the North, where school enrollment and literacy levels are very low.\n\nFlowing from our earlier discussion on the number of kidnapped children, the graph above shows the reported number of abducted school children in Nigeria by state since 2014.\n\nFor more insights like this, kindly follow @TechpointIntel on Twitter.\n\nTechpoint Africa headlines\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow banks can play in the booming crypto space.

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone. Image: Screenshot from \u2018How KaiOS Is Becoming the 3rd Major Mobile OS\u2019.\n\naYo Holdings, a micro-insurance joint venture between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH), announced yesterday, Thursday, October 28th, 2021, that it will be transforming its technology backend and data management approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means aYo will be modifying its business model.\n\nWhy? The company plans to drive greater scale, better customer experience, and faster access to markets across the African continent in the coming years.\n\nWhy should you care? Launched in 2017, aYo offers hospital and life cover in Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take?

Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis, the worst since the country\u2019s transition to democracy in 1999, is unrelenting and waging a continuous war on the people.\n\nSome 23 million Nigerians are unemployed, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the equivalent of the population of the Netherlands and Singapore combined.\n\nThe unemployment rate of 33.3 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia. What is worse is the forecast by economists that the rate could hit 40 percent by the end of 2021. Sadly, the pain of unemployed Nigerians is however not limited to simply having no jobs.\n\nUnemployed workers do not only lose their income, but their minimum security and their health benefits. They lose the capacity to update themselves in their professions. They lose their identity. Their families are unstructured. Their lives are unstructured. A family in which all members lose their jobs lives the reality of hunger, lack of housing, illness and poor or no education.\n\nVou was sacked from her job in a bank in 2017. It was in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s first recession in 40 years. She had spent 11 years with the bank working mainly in operations, she said.\n\n\u201cWe came to the office one Monday and many of us found that we could not log into our systems. We later got our sack letters and were told to go home. They told us that if the economic situation improved, they would call us back,\u201d she narrated.\n\nThe economic situation has not improved much since then. Over 8,000job losses were recorded among bank workers in 2017, the trend was similar with over 3000 employee layoff in the banking sector between 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nAbout 44,664 contract staff on the payroll of commercial banks have been reduced by over 5,000 as well as over 2,000 junior staff losing their jobs, among others. According to the NBS, almost 8,000 job losses occurred in the sector in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nVow was paid her entitlements four months later. She moved to her hometown, near Jos in Plateau State and poured her entire savings into farming Fonio and Maize. It was a large farm, and Vou had plans to pour her accounting degree and financial management experience to turn it into a profitable agro-business outfit supplying Fonio, Corn and in the future, green vegetables to markets in Lagos and the South.\n\nAs the crops grew lush on fertilizer and care, the cows came. The cattle herders simply led their cows into Vou\u2019s farm and ate up her crops.\n\n\u201cIt was scorched-earth,\u201d she said, \u201cI watched them destroy my farm. They ate it all up. I called the police and they did nothing. Cows just come and eat up peoples\u2019 sweat and livelihood and nothing happens to them.\u201d\n\nWith all her savings gone, Vou lives with her mother in Jos and has spent the last four years applying for jobs. \u201cIt has been a terrible period. I have no income, no money. I depend on friends and family to survive. I have become a burden to my poor mother who I should be taking care of. The worst thing is that it looks as if I am lazy whereas I am willing to work. I just do not know where to start from\u201d.\n\nThe absence of a functioning social security system capable of providing support to households that have lost jobs and income make job losses in Nigeria especially caustic. Nigeria\u2019s constitution does not provide a legal right to social security, and as noted by Human Rights Watch, Nigerian laws create no entitlement to unemployment or child benefits. Nigeria does have a pension scheme open to employees in the formal and informal sectors, but enrolment is only about 40 percent nationally, according to the World Bank.\n\nJobless, with no incomes and battered by rising food prices, insecurity and the absence of any form of government support, more than 20 million Nigerians and their families are left hungry.\n\n\u201cA combination of rising unemployment, booming demographics, and unfulfilled aspirations is increasing the pressure on young Nigerians to migrate internationally in search for gainful employment,\u201d a recent World Bank report noted.\n\n\u201cWith limited legal migration options, young Nigerians are increasingly choosing irregular alternatives to find better work opportunities overseas.\n\nTerver lives in Abuja. He worked for a Lagos-based FMCG manufacturing company for 14 years as a Sales Representative in Kano and Kaduna states. He was sacked from his job in mid-2019.\n\n\u201cThey let us go two years ago after the company closed over 80 percent of its production capacity\u201d. The company, he said, closed shop because the economic crisis led to poor sales and hence low production.\n\nTerver has tried to find work, \u201cany work,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three children; they are all out of school now. I cannot afford to pay their school fees, so they have had to stay home and be home schooled by my wife since last year.\u201d\n\nHis wife also lost her job as a casual worker in a bank in 2018.\n\nTerver said what he fears most is a health crisis in the family. \u201cIf any serious health crisis crops up now, I\u2019m so scared that I would not be able to afford the money to deal with it. I am afraid to lose any of my children or wife to sickness. The thought keeps me awake at night.\u201d\n\nTerver\u2019s fear for his family is driving him to consider making the long tortures journey to Europe via Libya. He fully understands the risk to his life. \u201cWhat can I do,\u201d he asked, his hands wide open, his face painted in frustration. \u201cI just can\u2019t stay here and mope around, always hoping to get an elusive job while my children go hungry. Nothing kills a man more than seeing his children hungry.\u201d\n\nWhy is unemployment growing?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari claims his regime has lifted 10 million Nigerians out of poverty, the World Bank maintains that 7 million Nigerians became poor under Buhari in 2020.\n\nThe inadequacy of job opportunities in Nigeria, noted a 2015 World Bank report, \u201cis at the core of high poverty levels, regional inequality, and social and political unrest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHaving a job is often understood as receiving a wage, enjoying a minimum standard of living, and having some access to social security such as health and pension.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has been in a macabre freefall since 2015. Driven by a salad of extremely unsavoury fiscal policies by a government more keen on handing out petty cash as social welfare schemes to drive growth, taxing a shrinking economic base to access funds, and a widely ridiculed monetary policy regime from a Central Bank that has woefully failed to maintain financial stability in over six years, President Buhari\u2019s administration\u2019s incapacity to stabilise and grow the economy has left most Nigerians befuddled.\n\nQuick to blame everyone but himself, Buhari in an interview in July blamed Nigerian youths for the deteriorating rate of unemployment. The youths, he said, need to be of good behaviour so that foreign investors can come into the country.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to invest in an insecure environment\u2026 If they want jobs, they will behave themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nRevenue declines and higher costs have negatively affected businesses in Africa\u2019s largest economy, leading to unprecedented job losses, the highest ever.\n\nRead Also: How age as job criterion worsens Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis\n\nPolicy inconsistencies by the Nigerian government, says Ndubisi Nwokoma, professor of Economics at the University of Lagos, has led to a lot of uncertainties.\n\nSince the Buhari administration came into power in 2015, he said in a report for the \u2018Conversation\u2019, \u201cthere has been a lot of policy change with the \u201ccommand and control\u201d posture adopted in managing the economy.\n\nFor instance, exchange rates were left fixed for the first year of the administration until the distortions in the market became chaotic before some form of flexibility was allowed in the determination of the exchange rate, following market forces. Also land borders were arbitrarily closed to imports, despite the huge damage it could have on the country\u2019s trade within the ECOWAS sub-region. This had a direct impact on prices of items.\n\n\u201cThese policy somersaults have caused capital flight. The political uncertainty played a role in the downward trend of markets. In the equities market, huge foreign portfolio investments were lost to the economy. There has also been a downturn in portfolio investments, fixed capital investment, foreign direct investments and capital importation. There was also a record decline in capital importation of about $1,548.88 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of same year. And in the first quarter of 2017, capital importation was recorded to be about $908.27 million.\n\n\u201cThe result has been job losses and the dwindling capacity to create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s flamboyant claims of growth and \u2018revolution\u2019 in the agricultural sector has proved to be untenable with agriculture\u2019s share of GDP falling, and farmers-herders\u2019 clashes cutting food production across the country, leading to steep rise in food prices. Manufacturing and other sectors have also been adversely affected\n\nProfessional services firm, KPMG, in a 2020 report described the country\u2019s policy environment as volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. On the uncertain landscape of the economy, the firm stated that the uncertainty that surrounds the Nigerian economy limits decision-making capabilities. Some examples listed include the sudden border closure, ban of use of motorcycles as means of transportation in some states, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the report noted, the complex environment reflects \u201cin multiple taxation, stamp duty, increase in electricity tariffs and so on. While the ambiguous landscape is characterized by the exchange rate systems, which have made the economy unattractive for foreign direct investment.\u201d\n\nOn the low level of productivity, the report revealed that low productivity was a critical problem limiting economic potential of individuals and firms in Nigeria, asserting that Nigeria\u2019s productivity level had been trending below the country\u2019s GDP, as labour productivity continues to slope to the negative region.\n\nNigeria, it noted, \u201chas been faced with declining GDP per capita since the aftermath of recession in 2016,\u201d and asserted that \u201climited income growth, increased taxes, electricity tariff hike, inflation and high unemployment are key issues that affect consumption power.\u201d\n\nThe firm further noted that the social wheel of pressure in the country was spinning, as 31 percent of the youth-led labour force was unemployed, meaning the key engine for Nigeria\u2019s growth remains grossly underutilized.\n\nWhat must be done\n\nProviding enough productive jobs for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population presents a particular challenge, especially at a time of weak economic growth.\n\nAs posited by the World Bank, labour is the main asset for the world\u2019s poorest people. This means that the labour market is \u201cthe primary vehicle through which the proceeds of economic growth are spread to households and individuals. Therefore, understanding the labour market is crucial to achieve Nigeria\u2019s aspiration to lift 100 million people out of poverty by 2030.\u201d\n\nIt will be critical to invest in human capital, recouping learning lost due to insecurity and long years of poor investment in education by the state. Doing this will not only provide workers with the skills needed to prosper in the labour market and create jobs themselves, but as argued by the international financial institution, \u201ccould also aid the country\u2019s fertility transition, so that the proceeds of growth are shared among fewer people, enabling a faster rise in living standards.\u201d\n\nSecondly, the policy framework has to be more stable. The Nigerian government needs to address insecurity so people can thrive in their business. The government must also undertake macroeconomic reforms around exchange-rate, trade, and fiscal policies to help the economy broaden away from oil and kindle the structural transformation needed to create good wage jobs.\n\nThere are quick-win strategies too. Nigeria, said Ndubisi Nwokoma, must also encourage investment. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low level of deposit rates. And it is unattractive to invest even in treasury bills or other securities. The rates are low, and the inflation rate is much higher. So every day your money loses value. The infrastructure for small scale production, including electricity supply, is poor and people have to provide their own.\u201d\n\nWhile Buhari believes agriculture is the best route to reducing unemployment, this dated worldview is untenable. Better jobs are generally found in modern, productive enterprises.\n\nTherefore, the only way to improve youth\u2019s income-earning prospects significantly and sustainably is to improve all employment and earnings opportunities through economic transformation. Economic growth without transformation is much less effective.\n\nAs aptly noted in a 2021 Brookings Institution report, \u201ctransformation, through the creation of modern, higher-productivity firms, can gradually replace informal employment with formal employment.\u201d\n\nThe best way to increase good formal sector wage jobs is to encourage the entrance and growth of large firms, since it has been proved that large firms play an outsized role in economic transformation and employment creation since they tend to use newer technology, pay higher wages, and are more likely to export.\n\nThey push transformation forward and support resiliency because they are better able to weather economic storms. They often structure the market for medium and smaller firms operating in related sectors who will be their suppliers and retailers, thus helping to ensure their survival as well.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis, the worst since the country\u2019s transition to democracy in 1999, is unrelenting and waging a continuous war on the people.\n\nSome 23 million Nigerians are unemployed, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the equivalent of the population of the Netherlands and Singapore combined.\n\nThe unemployment rate of 33.3 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia. What is worse is the forecast by economists that the rate could hit 40 percent by the end of 2021. Sadly, the pain of unemployed Nigerians is however not limited to simply having no jobs.\n\nUnemployed workers do not only lose their income, but their minimum security and their health benefits. They lose the capacity to update themselves in their professions. They lose their identity. Their families are unstructured. Their lives are unstructured. A family in which all members lose their jobs lives the reality of hunger, lack of housing, illness and poor or no education.\n\nVou was sacked from her job in a bank in 2017. It was in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s first recession in 40 years. She had spent 11 years with the bank working mainly in operations, she said.\n\n\u201cWe came to the office one Monday and many of us found that we could not log into our systems. We later got our sack letters and were told to go home. They told us that if the economic situation improved, they would call us back,\u201d she narrated.\n\nThe economic situation has not improved much since then.

Currently, it costs N411 to get one dollar from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), while it costs around N580 in the parallel market.\n\nIn addition, manufacturers complain that they get two to 10 percent of their dollar needs from the market even after waiting for 30-90 days.\n\nAccording to analysts at FBN Quest, the impact of elevated raw material costs and higher cost of production was evident in the third quarter suboptimal financial performance of some publicly listed manufacturing companies particularly the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG).\n\n\u201cWe see some pressure points relating to the high cost of sales and opex on some names, such as Nigerian Breweries and Dangote Sugar Refinery whose gross margins decreased by 1042bps and 485bps, respectively, in Q3 \u201921,\u201d analysts said.\n\nRead also: Despite 6th successive slowdown in inflation rate, Nigeria\u2019s negative real return increases\n\nManufacturers\u2019 production and distribution costs increased by 21 percent in the second quarter of 2021, the hike in production cost also caused a 29 percent decline in the volume of production, according to the MAN CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) for the second quarter of 2021 compiled by MAN.\n\nOkhai Ehimigbai, an export executive at Aarti Steel said goods manufactured in Nigeria have one of the highest production costs in the world and this is majorly because every manufacturer is their government whereby they provide infrastructure, power among others themselves.\n\n\u201cProduction cost has increased and these rising costs have to be transferred to the end-user of the products so this inflates the cost thereby hindering the competitiveness of players in the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysis of Nestle Nigeria, Dangote sugar, Cadbury, Unilever, and NASCON\u2019s financial statement for the period ended June 2021 revealed that the cumulative cost of sales of these companies was N197 billion which was a 32 percent increase from the N149 billion realized in the same period of 2020.\n\nThis significantly affected their profit for the period as it grew by a marginal eight percent moving from N22.6 billion in 2020 to N24.5 billion in the first half of 2021.\n\nJide Babatope, a Lagos-based economic analyst said the direct and operating costs of these firms increased significantly eating deep into their revenue, which caused the slow growth in their profit margin.\n\n\u201cThe FMCGs were confronted with high operating costs during this period following the persistent inflationary pressure and FX illiquidity. Companies with huge profit decline must have experienced a double whammy of fragile revenue growth and escalated cost level,\u201d he explained.\n\nExperts believe that if issues around FX availability and accessibility are not addressed promptly, many of these companies will fold up which will consequently collapse the sector and affect job creation.\n\nThe PMI index had hit 51 points in May but dropped continuously till it hit 48 points in July. It showed signs of strained recovery as it ended the third quarter with 49.6 and 50.3 points in August and September respectively.",

That compares with the N25.1 billion for the same period of last year.\n\nPre-tax profit inched up 1.4 per cent to N177.3 billion while profit-after-tax stood at N160.6billion compared to the N159.3 billion of last year.",

          "title": "Anambra 2021: Anarchy looms ahead of governorship polls",
          "text": "Late last week, a gory video showing two freshly murdered corpses, which a narrator identified as an official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and his police orderly murdered by some unknown gunmen working to ensure that Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State doesn\u2019t hold, went viral on social media, along with another video of a certain self declared General Innocent Orji, leader of a new armed separatist group, Biafra National Guard (BNG), announcing that in line with the declaration of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Anambra poll cannot be allowed to hold.\n\nDays before the election, its fate is ever more uncertain as gunmen whose long stated objective is to ensure that the people of the state state do not elect new leadership have declared war against security agencies and intending voters, in what is a security challenge assuming worrying dimensions in the country\u2019s Southeast where the ever present agitation a separate state of Biafra has grown increasingly violent.\n\nOnly last week, at least eight people were killed in the state, following confrontations between soldiers and the said gunmen.\n\nIn a statement at the weekend, Army spokesperson, Brig Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops killed four members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), a militant wing of IPOB during an exchange of gunfire in the state.\n\n\u201cTroops of 82 Division Nigerian Army conducting Exercise GOLDEN DAWN have neutralised four gunmen of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra/ Eastern Security Network (IPOB/ESN) in a fierce encounter at Nnobi Junction, Idemili South Local Government Area on Friday 29 October 2021. This followed the assailants\u2019 armed attack on personnel of security agencies deployed at Ekwulobia Round About in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, during which troops swiftly mobilised to the scene and subsequently embarked on pursuit of the criminals along Nnewi \u2013 Nnobi road,\u201d Nwachukwu had said.\n\n\u201cTroops made contact with the fleeing gunmen and engaged them in a fire fight, neutralising four of the criminals. The gallant troops also recovered two AK-47 Rifles, one GALIL Ace 5.56 x 45 Iwi Gun, one Avofeng Hand held radio and one Black Highlander jeep. Sadly, a personnel of one of the security agencies paid the supreme price.\n\n\u201cIn a separate operation, troops have foiled another attack by IPOB/ESN gunmen at Umunze Checkpoint, in Orumba South Local Government Area. The vigilant troops overwhelmed the attackers in the shootout that ensued, forcing them to take to their heels, abandoning, one Pump Action gun with nine cartridges, one dark blue Ford and four motorcycles, which the troops have recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army notes that the recent attacks are part of proscribed IPOB/ESN plan to instil fear into the public and sabotage forthcoming Anambra State Governorship Election. Members of the public are reassured that the Nigerian Army, sister services and other security agencies will not relent in resolutely confronting all criminals intents against the citizenry and national interest. Law abiding citizens are enjoined to continue to go about their daily activities without any fear. They are also encouraged to report any unusual activity observed across Anambra State to the nearest security post.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an unfolding mayhem. The brutal, murder, weeks ago, of Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband of late Prof Dora Akunyili, brought more attention to what had been weeks of series of killings in the state as gunmen, comprising of cult groups, pro Biafra agitators and political thugs continue to unleash mayhem.\n\nWith Saturday\u2019s election in view, pro Biafra militants who are determined to ensure that the election does not hold, have declared war against just anyone seen to be working to ensure that the polls hold, including politicians, officials of INEC, and security agencies who have continued to respond in kind. The atmosphere is ever more intense and may residents of the state say they\u2019d rather stay indoors than take the risk being killed trying to vote on election day.\n\n\u201cFor me, I have seen and heard enough,\u201d said Mr. Oliver Nwafor, a business owner in Awka. \u201cI have no intention of going out to vote on Saturday. I cannot risk my life. The truth is that the election is at risk. People will not go out that day, because nobody wants to die.\u201d\n\nIn Awka, Nwafor\u2019s sentiments is widely shared. Many people spoken to say they would rather stay away from the polling boots than risk being killed by gunmen.\n\nFortnight ago, IPOB, through its spokesman, Emma Powerful, threatened to lock down the entire Southeast for one week, from November 5, a day to the election, if President Muhammadu Buhari does not release its leader, Kanu from the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) on or before November 4, in an apparent attempt to use the election as bargaining chip.\n\nThe possibility of Buhari ordering Kanu\u2019s release from custody does not exist. His case remains in court and he is detained on the order of the court. The IPOB, may indeed carry out its threat, not minding the continued protestations of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and other interested groups against the move. Since the group began declaring sit-at-home protest following the arrest of Kanu, it\u2019s foot soldiers have been ruthlessly enforcing same, compelling residents to stay at home every Monday, even when it\u2019s leadership had repeatedly cancelled the Monday sit-at-home directive. Many have been attacked; sometimes murdered, and numerous businesses have been destroyed by hoodlums enforcing the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe proscribed group has particularly warned Anambra residents not to risk going out the during of the order, one many say they will obey despite heavy deployment of security agencies by federal government for the election.\n\nAt a special consultative meeting with political parties in Abuja on Friday, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, assured that the election will hold as planned, but that the commission will not be deploying electoral materials and personnel in 86 of the 5,720 polling units, as there are yet no registered voters at the affected units.\n\nMahmood hinged his confidence on the report he received from the security agency in the state, particularly the state Commissioner of Police as well as the Resident Electoral Commissioner.\n\nOver the past few days, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has adopted series of security measures to ensure that the election is held despite the threat posed by the rampaging gunmen.\n\nOn October 14, he ordered the mobilization and deployment of a total of 34,587 police personnel, three Police Helicopters, technical capabilities of the Police Airwing, the Force Marine and the Force Animal Branch, and other operational assets for the election.\n\nLast week, the IGP, deployed selected seasoned Strategic Commanders from the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police and above to the state for effective supervision of security personnel and operations during the elections.\n\nIn particular, the IGP deployed Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Joseph Egbunike to coordinate security for the polls.\n\nSimilarly, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), deployed 20, 000 officers and men to complement sister-security agencies, while troops of the 82 Division, Nigeria Army currently conducting Exercise Golden Dawn in the state and rest of the Southeast, are battling to contain rampaging gunmen.\n\nBut residents say they have not seen enough to convince them that it would be safe to step out on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be going out on Saturday,\u201d declared Chidi Okeke, a tailor in Amawbia. \u201cYes, the police and Army have been deployed, but people can still be attacked. The state government has now adopted Saturday as school day because they cannot protect students on Mondays. How can they protect everyone on election day?\u201d\n\nEarly last month, following the killing of Dr. Akunyili, among others, Mr. Abubakar Malami, Attorney General and Minister of Justice, threatened that a state of emergency could be a possibility in the state, a threat which triggered generated outrage, forcing the government to backtrack.\n\nBuhari has since directed the Armed Forces and other security agencies to ensure that nothing stops the election, and with effort being put in place by INEC, the election is certain to hold. But voter apathy is sure to greet the polls, which for many, will play into the hands of the country\u2019s party, the All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nIndeed, the party\u2019s candidate, Senator Andy Uba, despite being unpopular among the electorate, is now considered very much a front runner, with the potential to put an end to the almost two decades rule of the All Progressive Grand Alliance in the state.\n\n\u201cIf election holds and people go out to vote, Andy Uba cannot win,\u201d said Chidi Nwafor, political observer in Awka. \u201cIf there is an election, APGA or PDP will win. Uba cannot win. APC is not liked here, and Uba is very unpopular, even in his home town, forget social media propaganda.\n\n\u201cBut as it stands, people will not come out to vote, and that will enable him to use federal might to rig the election. They might repeat what they did in Imo State. But unlike Imo, they may not wait to go to court, they may take the state by force and ask you to go to court.\u201d\n\nThe threat of violence could be the major deciding factor. Candidates had been forced to suspend campaigns, and while APGA\u2019s candidate, former governor of the Central Bank, had stood out as the favorite candidate and the most likely to win, as shown by a survey by our correspondents, followed in that order by PDP\u2019s Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, the outcome of the election may ultimately be decided by the other intervening variables rather than popularity of candidates.\n\n\u201cAPGA has not been able to campaign because of the violence. The party has not been able to campaign in up to three local governments. Everyone is afraid,\u201d Nwafor said. \u201cPeople will not come out to vote, unless IPOB declares that the election should hold. Otherwise, they would be too afraid to go out to vote.\u201d",

          "title": "Equities market surges despite ravaging poverty",
          "text": "By Okey Onyenweaku\n\nAnalysts may have missed the mark, especially when it comes to predicting the markets this season. Despite the odds, the equities market has remained impressive.\n\nWith the NGX All share Index standing at 42,049.14 as at Friday October 29, 2021, the equities market has seemingly gained 12 per cent in the last five months, up from an ASI of 37,585.25 basis points as at Monday June 28, 2021.\n\nThis seems unusual and contradicts the assertion that the capital market is usually a reflection of the economy. But despite the fact that very unfortunately, the Nigerian economy has remained weak and is indeed faced with a drought scenario, the equities market is proving to be an outlier.\n\nThis notwithstanding, not many Nigerians are optimistic that the economy of the country has much to offer them given the excruciating pains pervading the environment and the general state of affairs. While many believe that the politics of the country is incapable of creating an enabling atmosphere to nudge the economy forward, others have listed mis-governance, high insecurity, lack of productivity among others for losing hope in the growth trajectory of the economy.\n\nThe challenges are numerous, a former managing Director of one of the big banks who would not want to be mentioned in print told Business Hallmark.\n\nCompounding this is the negative impact of Covid-19 which joined other factors in ensuring that Nigeria plunged into a recession in the second quarter of 2020. However, the economy slowly rallied to grow by 0.11 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter; grew again by 0.51 in first quarter 2021 and then by a COVID-reversing 5.1 in second quarter of 2021, up from a -6.1 negative position in 2020.\n\nYet this does not change the pessimism of many who believe the economic managers and the government are still not on the right path more so when other core economic fundamentals remain largely southward.\n\nGoing to deeper grounds, recent statistics reveal that the rate of unemployment, the second highest in the world is 33%. At the same time, the underemployment rate stood at 22%; even as inflation, which had hit above 18 per cent earlier in the year is still high at 16.01 per cent. At the same time, Nigeria has accumulated a total debt stock of N36trillion which is even still growing.\n\nUnfortunately, the more dreadful aspect of it is that the federal government spends 90 per cent to service the loans.\n\nAt this rate, it is difficult to understand the magic the government would perform to turn around this distressed condition.\n\nDespite the above not too comfortable picture, the World Bank raised its projections for Nigerian economy from 1.8% earlier to 2.4per cent in 2021.\n\nIn January, the Bretton Wood institution had projected a 1.1 percent growth rate for the country in 2021 after the Covid-19-induced recession in 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019Economic growth has raised living standards around the world. However, modern economies have lost sight of the fact that the standard metric of economic growth, gross domestic product (GDP), merely measures the size of a nation\u2019s economy and doesn\u2019t reflect a nation\u2019s welfare. Yet policymakers and economists often treat GDP, or GDP per capita in some cases, as an all-encompassing unit to signify a nation\u2019s development, combining its economic prosperity and societal well-being. As a result, policies that result in economic growth are seen to be beneficial for society.\n\n\u2018\u2019We know now that the story is not so simple \u2013 that focusing exclusively on GDP and economic gain to measure development ignores the negative effects of economic growth on society, such as climate change and income inequality. It\u2019s time to acknowledge the limitations of GDP and expand our measure development so that it takes into account a society\u2019s quality of life\u2019\u2019 a 2019 Harvard Business Review had noted. Growing the GDP appears to be Nigeria\u2019s priority.\n\nYet Nigeria for which 70 per cent of revenue comes from crude oil priced at above $80pbd, has all her focus on GDP that still grows very slowly.\n\nWhile the per capita income stood at $2,073.783 and over 100million survive on $1.9 a day, the equities market remains stable and more of the times bullish than bearish.\n\nUnfortunately too, the 2021 budget runs a deficit of N5.2trillion representing 3.6 per cent.\n\nThese have not deterred the equities market which gained over 50per cent at the end of business year 2020 and is still looking impressive in the third quarter 2021. Yesterday Friday October 29, 2021 the All share index closed higher by 0.2 per cent to 42,049.35 from 41,961.14 points on Thursday October 28,2021. In the last five months the market has appreciated 12per cent, a false indication of impressive economy.\n\nWhereas analysts seem divided on the fundamentals of the market but they posited that various reasons responsible for the bullish disposition of the market. But majority of them believe that any time the price of crude rises as the case presently that crude price is $80pbd and above investors in Nigeria become hopeful and encouraged. Others have also pointed that the fact that the economy was recording growth no matter how small could be enough encouragement to invest in the market. There is also a consensus that the Nigerian market is always attractive given that stock prices are cheap compared with stocks in the developed economies.\n\nAfter all, the market appears to be garnering momentum again given impressive results that are trickling in from companies in the second quarter 2021. Most banks and other firms are also paying good interim dividends in the period ended June 31, 2021.\n\nThese activities and other events seem to have boosted confidence in the market as well as propelled a surge.\n\nManaging Director of High Cap Securities limited, Mr. David Adonri agrees that whereas the economy appears to be struggling in the eyes of the people on the street, the numbers are saying a different story. Adonri noted that rising price of crude, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the reduction in inflation among other factors are some of the factors propelling the equities market and attracting investors.\n\nAnother financial analyst with the Renaissance Group, Mr. Olisa Egbunike told Business Hallmark in a telephone interview that discerning investors need not be told when to take positions in the market. He noted that those with the wherewithal are taking advantage of the weak Naira and other challenges to mop up the stocks at the moment, while hoping for better times going forward.\n\nOn their part, the analysts at Cordros Securities said: \u201cAccording to the September Domestic & Foreign Portfolio Investment report of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), total transaction value at the domestic equities market increased by 32.1% m/m to NGN118.15 billion in September (August: NGN89.42 billion) \u2013 the highest since April (NGN159.93 billion). The increase was mainly due to a 46.4% m/m increase in domestic transactions (79.4% of total transaction value), reflecting robust participation of institutional investors (+92.6% m/m vs August: NGN32.21 billion). Meanwhile, foreign transactions declined by 4.0% m/m to NGN24.35 billion. We highlight that the total transaction value at the local bourse printed NGN1.33 trillion in 9M-21 (9M-20: NGN1.34 trillion)\u201d.\n\n\u2018\u2019The bullish run in the local bourse persisted for the seventh consecutive week as investors flocked into bellwether stocks following broadly impressive quarterly earnings released\u2019\u2019, added the Cordros Securities analysis.\n\nBH recalls that in the corresponding period of 2008, the market maintained a bullish disposition and investors smiled to the banks even as the major indicators attained unprecedented heights.\n\nThe market capitalization peaked at about 13.1trillion and the All share Index gained a giddy height of 66,551.84 basis points on March 5, 2008. Most of the equities grew bullish and the Nigerian Capital Market was thrown into frenzy.\n\nThe market became the toast of the Nigerian Business community, with traders, civil servants, farmers and even students making equity investments.\n\nMany analysts noted that the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) became a beehive of activities with both investors and speculators scrambling to make a kill. Some individual stocks recorded over 100% appreciation while others edged up by 50% and above.\n\nThe one million question in the mouth of many, is how sustainable is the bullish market?\n\nThe exchange has just the demutualized and has moved from operating as a not-for-profit, member owned entity and has become a profit-driven, limited liability company which is accountable to its shareholders.\n\nThe Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has just joined the league of Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Nairobi Stock Exchange, which are already publicly listed companies. This has resulted in the creation of a new non-operating holding company, the Nigerian Exchange Group PLC (NGX Group) with Mr. Oscar Onyema serving as its Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO).\n\nUnder the demutualization plan of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, a new non-operating holding company, the Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (\u2018NGX Group\u2019), has been created. The Group has three operating subsidiaries, namely: Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX Limited), the operating exchange; NGX Regulation Limited (NGX REGCO), the independent regulation company; and NGX Real Estate Limited (NGX RELCO), the real estate company.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has rolled out a new scheme targeted at financing 25,000 graduate entrepreneurs annually, which will, in turn, create an additional 75,000 sustainable jobs annually across the country.\n\nThis, the apex bank said, is coming in form of loans for university and polytechnic graduates who are willing to set up businesses under the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES), as part of its effort to fight rising unemployment in the country.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate rose to 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020, translating to some 23.2 million people, the highest in at least 13 years and the second-highest rate in the world.\n\nThe figure had jumped from 27.1 per cent recorded in the second quarter amidst Nigeria\u2019s lingering economic crisis made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment rate in the country has more than quadrupled since 2016 when the economy slipped into a recession. A second recession occurred in 2020.\n\nAccording to the implementation guideline released and signed by Yusuf Yila Philip, CBN\u2019s Director, Development Finance, the objective of the TIES is to enhance access to finance by undergraduates and graduates of polytechnics and universities in Nigeria with innovative entrepreneurial and technological ideas.\n\n\u201cThe CBN, as part of its policy measures to address rising youth unemployment and underemployment, introduces the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) to create a paradigm shift among undergraduates and graduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities, from seeking white-collar jobs to entrepreneurship,\u201d the apex bank said.\n\n\u201cThe scheme aims to provide an innovative financing model that will boost job creation, enhance entrepreneurship development, and support economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe guideline further said start-ups and existing businesses in areas such as agribusiness, information technology, creative industry, as well as science and technology are eligible for financing under the scheme.\n\nIt further noted that priority would be given to innovative entrepreneurial activities with high potentials for export, job creation and transformational impact.\n\nThe apex bank also explained that the scheme will be implemented through three components namely term loan, equity investment and developmental components.\n\nUnder the term loan component, an individual project can access a maximum loan of N5 million with a five-year tenor and interest rate of five percent per annum (nine percent effective from March 1, 2022, or as may be prescribed by the CBN). For partnership/company projects, the loan is limited to N25 million.\n\n\u201cApplicants under the scheme shall be graduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities with first-degree certificate (BSc/HND/ or its equivalent); National Youth Service Certificate (NYSC) discharge or exemption certificate; Certificate of Participation issued by polytechnics and universities evidencing entrepreneurship training; and not more than 7 years post-NYSC,\u201d the document reads.\n\nThe CBN added that the equity investment component shall be in the form of injection of fresh capital for start-ups, expansion of established businesses or reviving of ailing entrepreneurial businesses.\n\nAnother component of the intervention is the developmental component which shall be disbursed in the form of grants to Nigerian polytechnics and universities in a national biennial entrepreneurship competition.\n\nThe apex bank said it would award N500 million worth of grants to five top Nigerian polytechnics and universities with the best entrepreneurial pitches/ideas. Only undergraduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities are eligible to participate under the developmental component.\n\n\u201cFive top Nigerian polytechnics and universities with the best entrepreneurial pitches/ideas shall be awarded as follows: first place \u2013 N150m; second place \u2013 N120m; third place \u2013 N100m; fourth place \u2013 N80m; and fifth place \u2013 N50m,\u201d the document adds.\n\n\u2018\u2018Interested applicants must apply on the dedicated online portal (https://cbnties.com.ng) and provide all the requisite documents to support the application.\u201d\n\nHowever, an economist and private sector advocate, Dr.Muda Yusuf, believes that as much as interventionist schemes are good in tackling unemployment, they are not sustainable but only function for as long as there is budget to drive them.\n\nYusuf, a former Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said in a monitored interview that what is sustainable is to create an environment where those who are creating the jobs will be able to sustain their investments and grow their businesses.\n\nHe said: \u201cUnemployment is a function of investment. If people are not investing or if people who are already investing are having challenges sustaining their investments, then there is a problem.\n\n\u201cSo the only sustainable way to deal with the unemployment problem is to fix the challenges of investors, the challenges of entrepreneurs, especially the micro enterprises, the SMEs and all of them. All over the place, there is a whole lot of challenges that they\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cI know the government has been trying to do N-Power and all sorts of schemes. Those things are not that sustainable, they can only function for a while, for as long as they have the budget to drive it.\n\n\u201cWhat is sustainable is to create an environment where those who\u2019re creating the jobs, which are the SMEs, the medium enterprises, the large enterprises, will be able to sustain their investments and grow their businesses. As investments grow, employments will come.\n\n\u201cSo, that is why it important for government to listen a lot more to those who are investing in this economy. There\u2019re not getting the right attention.\n\n\u201cAll the government is concerned about is how to generate revenue, sending all the agencies to go and look for money, not minding the implication of that for those who\u2019re investing.\n\n\u201cThe pressure on them is a lot. There is the pressure of infrastructure; there\u2019s the pressure of the regulator; there is the pressure from the tax people; there\u2019s the pressure at the port.\n\n\u201cNow you have these macroeconomic problems. Inflation for instance, look at the way prices are galloping. Look at what is happening to our exchange rate. Those are microeconomic issues and they\u2019re also a major part of the investment environment.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a very big issue, but the immediate thing we need to do is to encourage those who are creating the jobs by providing the enabling environment for them to be able to create the jobs.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The majority leader, Plateau State House of Assembly, Hon Naanlong Gapyil, has said that the embattled Speaker of the Assembly, Hon. Nuhu Ayuba Abok, was impeached by 16 members of the House for financial misappropriation and gross incompetence.\n\nGapyil, who stated this in an interview at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, alleged that the former Speaker used his position to corruptly enrich himself and develop his personal political empire, thereby frustrating policies that could have engendered development to the state.\n\nGapyil further accused the former Speaker of shutting down the House for three months and finding a home in the major opposition party, noting that these acts culminated in what led to his ouster as the Speaker of Plateau House of Assembly.\n\nThe member representing Mikang constituency showed reporters videos of the impeachment proceedings affirming that 16 members of the House of Assembly signed the impeachment notice and followed due process in line with the House rules.\n\nThe lawmaker further noted with regret that the House was just managing the former Speaker as he was at the lowest ebb of intellectual matters, especially in areas relating to legislative businesses.\n\nHon. Gapyil said, \u201cJournalists from both the print and electronic media were invited and were present. We made it bold to ask members of the media to take a headcount of the honourable members in the House today which they did. Now, if you have watched the video containing house proceedings, you would find out that apart from the minority leader and Hon. Simi, all other PDP members were present. In all, 14 APC and 2 PDP members voted and impeached the former Speaker and the record is available. No impeachment can take place without satisfying the requirement of the law and we are fully aware of this.\n\n\u201cIt is equally the reason why we ensured that we followed due process. The list of the members who attended today\u2019s proceedings was submitted to the Clerk of the House and he confirmed it before he authorized the change in leadership of the House.\n\n\u201cAbok is also said to have made concerted efforts to thwart all the efforts put in place by the current administration of Governor Lalong and the goodwill earned by it simply because he felt he has found a new home other than the All Progressives Party,\u201d the majority leader alleged.\n\nHe said Abok is a product of the ruling APC, stressing that all he ought to have done was to have work in line with the policies and programmes of the current government to ensure delivery of dividends of democracy to the people of Plateau State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut I want to tell you that what the House under the former Speaker Nuhu Abok was doing was totally in the negation of what is expected of a leader who is supposed to put into account his primary responsibility first in all his undertakings. This is because we have the mandate of the people of Plateau State to represent them well. Being a Speaker is a privilege and I must tell you that the way and manner Abok has managed this House as its Speaker can be summarised as embarrassing. First, since autonomy was granted to the PLHA under Abok, there was never a time that the principal officers ever met, discuss, and took any decision on any issue.\n\n\u201cAbok was only taking decisions solely without recourse to Principal Officers of the House.

          "title": "As A True Believer Of Christ I Won\u2019t Ridicule Those In Power \u2014 Pastor Kumuyi Defends Silence On Buhari Regime\u2019s Failure",
          "text": "Pastor Williams Kumuyi, the General Superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, has warned Nigerians not to criticize individuals in positions of authority.\n\nKumuyi admitted the failures of the Muhammadu Buhari administration in a Sunday Twitter thread titled \u201cThe Church and the Challenges of a Nation,\u201d but stated that God is more interested in a \u201cfusion of obedience to His Word and relating amicably with fellow human beings, regardless of class, color, caste (religion), or culture.\u201d\n\nThe cleric further stated that true Christians should never disdain those in power due to perceived failures and neither should Christians go on the rampage, destroying government property or pillaging the public till.\n\nHe further clarified that human needs are both physical and spiritual and while the government caters for the body, the church is saddled with providing spiritual needs. He, however, said none is mutually independent of the other.\n\nThe Twitter post reads, \u201cAt a public forum in Lagos in September this year, a visibly disturbed former Vice-Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Professor Dapo Asaju, challenged me and my brother minister, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, to speak up in the face of the pall of insecurity overlooking our dear country, Nigeria, and threatening us all with a pin-down. He says it\u2019s not enough to \u2018\u2019keep quiet\u2019 and pastor only our congregants.\n\n\u201cHe wants us, among other charges, to meet President Muhammadu Buhari and tell him, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The don said: \u2018All ministers of God must speak out\u2026I (am) looking forward to Baba (Kumuyi) addressing a World Conference, with Baba Adeboye seated beside him. Let them call people and say Enough is Enough\u2019.\n\n\u201c\u2019They need to lead other people to convene a high-powered meeting with the President.\u2019 He tied his call to the Scriptures, where troublous times in ancient Israel always witnessed the emergence of faithful messengers offering Divine succour and intervention.\n\n\u201c\u2019Nigeria of this age is also under the weather, Asaju laments; she needs the clerics\u2019 cuddling and comforting care.\n\nWe cannot dismiss the concerns of Bishop Professor Asaju. The patriot that he is, he like all of us, wouldn\u2019t want the escalation of our problems to get to the boiling point of no return.\n\n\u201cIf all else has failed, he seems to say, God\u2019s true representatives in the confines of His Holy Church here in Nigeria cannot fail to lead us away from the cusp pointing down to a dark abyss. He is also right to insist that pastors must not be satisfied with the \u2018narrow\u2019 mission of entering the annals as the clergymen with the largest congregation in Africa or the world. They must worry more about the environment these worshippers go into when they are discharged from the precincts of the Church.\n\n\u201cDo they march into the deadly embrace of harlots, armed robbers, kidnappers, drug addicts, the sick, unemployed youth given to crime and hopelessness, corrupt political office holders, broken homes, occult campuses, idolatry, immorality, urban violence etc.?\n\n\u201cAt Deeper Christian Life Ministry, we are far more aware of this existential crossroads than many perceive. We present the Word of God as delivered in the Holy Bible, alright. But we warn that in the long run, the Lord is interested in a fusion of obedience to His Word and relating amicably with fellow human beings, regardless of class, colour, caste (religion) or culture.\n\n\u201cWe teach that if you\u2019re a genuine believer in Christ, you wouldn\u2019t hate your neighbour. Nor would you disdain those in power because they appear not to be delivering on electoral pledges such that you would go on the rampage, destroying government property or pillaging the public till.\n\n\u201dWe teach a linear life of Christian walk: you can\u2019t be a saint on Sunday and a monster on Monday. Needless to say, God recognizes the dual nature He has clothed us with, physical body and soul. Both need to be fed proportionally. The inner soul requires the Word, while the external body needs material fulfillments through food, shelter, healing, job, joy, justice etc. The Creator hasn\u2019t annulled that order.\n\n\u201cHe expects the state to cater for the body while He saddles the Church with providing for the inner being. None is mutually independent of the other. Societies run into straits, setbacks and storms when they neglect this arrangement.\n\n\u201cBut diligently keying into this plan as individuals, nation and Church, gives us the far-reaching blessedness of obedience to His Word. We can testify to this as we have adopted the strategy, given by Heaven, to constantly embark on Global Crusades, with the community, and not the Church, as the epicentre.\n\n\u201cThe gatherings are all-inclusive, nondenominational. The limitless reach of today\u2019s smart media and the Internet has enabled us to touch almost every inch of the globe. In real-time audiovisual streaming, many across Nigeria, the African continent, Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia and New Zealand are able to get connected to our crusades.\n\n\u201cThose who can\u2019t make it to the viewing centres connect to me in their homes, hospitals, workplaces etc. Everywhere the Lord has been faithful to His promise to answer our prayers.\n\n\u201cAs the Lord graciously uses me to deliver His Word at these events, He never ceases to accompany the ministration with astonishing miracles of salvation, healing, restoration of hope to the despondent and deliverance of the nations from instability, insecurity and the invidious grip of the devil.\n\n\u201cWe have verifiable testimonies all over the planet underscoring the incredible power of the God of the Bible times being here with man again. He is leaping from the past to the present to prove that in any generation He doesn\u2019t forsake those who repose full faith in the finished work of Christ, in His promises and in His prophets..\u201d",

          "title": "PDP National Chairman-elect Ayu: Our party\u2019s successful convention, quit notice to APC",
          "text": "National Chairman-Elect of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Iyorchia Ayu has thrown a challenge to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSpecifically, the former President of the Senate said the successes recorded in the major opposition\u2019s just-concluded National Convention tagged \u201cNigeria Rescue Mission\u201d is a challenge to the ruling party to prepare and quit Aso Rock come 2023.\n\nAyu stated this in the early hours of Sunday after he was declared winner at the party\u2019s Special National Convention held at the Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nGoing down memory lane, the former minister said: \u201cWhen we started this party 23 years ago, we never in any way imagine that the journey will get us to this stage. A stage where we ruled for 16 years, we went into rough times, but for anybody who bothers to see, PDP is back. PDP is back to rescue Nigeria from the terrible mess we have been in, in the last six years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people imagined that this convention will lead to the breakup for the PDP. Those people who are dreaming like that were dreaming in a wonderland. Their dream was misplaced. Those who have lost hope should know that Nigeria is not a divided country. A small group of people decided to divide Nigeria. PDP will come back to unite our people; put them together, north and south, east and west.\n\n\u201cWe will move ahead to develop this country. We did it before. We are going to do it again. I want to thank the governors. I want to thank the delegates. I want to thank our supporters and every single person who has made this event such a huge success.\n\n\u201cI believe the other party can never hold a convention because even state congresses, they cannot hold. They have produced 92 state chairmen for 36 states, how can they hold a successful convention which the PDP has done? We are waiting for them. This is a challenge to them. Let them come and hold a successful convention. This is a quit notice, PDP is back and is taking back the country to develop it.\u201d\n\nParty chieftain Balogun too\n\nIn a similar comment, a PDP chieftain and lawmaker representing Oyo South Senatorial District, Senator Kola Balogun has said the convention was a demonstration of the party\u2019s commitment to participatory democracy.\n\nSenator Balogun stated this in a congratulatory message to the former deputy governor of Oyo state, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja on his emergence as the PDP deputy national chairman (South.)\n\nIn the statement signed by his media aide, Mr Dapo Falade, the lawmaker said Arapaja\u2019s emergence was victory for democracy, adding that the former deputy governor would further the cause and course of unity in the party.\n\nHe said: \u201cIndeed, the PDP, through the National Convention, has, once again, demonstrated its firm believe in participatory democracy. It is showing and leading the other political parties the way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victory of Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja and his emergence as the PDP Deputy National Chairman (South) at the National Convention of our great party, is a victory for the entire PDP family.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Arapaja emerged the winner of an exercise that was transparently clear and that was free and fair. The PDP has shown the way to go in the conduct of elections in our country. The victory of our new Deputy National Chairman (South) is not a personal victory but also a victory for the PDP, its teeming members and followers and, indeed, the entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker lauded the former governor of Osun state, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, for demonstrating the essence of participatory democracy.\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, on his belief in participatory democracy. His contesting for the same post lends more credibility to the PDP National Convention.\n\n\u201cPrince Oyinlola is a respected elder of our great party. His loss at the convention is nothing personal. I believe that he will continue to remain relevant in the PDP and he will always be there as one of our elders in the party,\u201d Balogun said.\n\nAPC\n\nBut the newly elected Enugu state Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adolphus Udeh has mocked the PDP over its pledge to rescue Nigeria.\n\nUdeh said before rescuing Nigeria, PDP should first account for its 16 years of uncountable underdevelopment obstacles the party embedded in the system prior to their exit from power in 2015.\n\nIn a press statement released Sunday to Blueprint in Abuja, Udeh said he closely observed the PDP convention where speaker after speaker lampooned the APC and claimed they were on a rescue mission.\n\nHe blamed the current socio-economic challenges confronting Nigeria under the APC government on PDP\u2019s 16 years of misrule.\n\n\u201cIs it not better PDP starts by first accounting for uncountable underdevelopment obstacles they embedded in the system before their exit in 2015? PDP acted like tenant who wrote favourable contract agreement for itself against Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTake the power sector for instance where the contract agreement between Federal Government and DisCos and GenCos are in favour of the private companies. PDP weaved these skewed contract agreements and in fact nominated those less than efficient companies,\u201d Udeh said.\n\nHe said President Buhari cannot just wake up and cancel the contracts(power sector), stressing that \u201cit takes time to unbundle the less than transparent clauses in the contract, no matter how faulty, otherwise, the media would accuse him of dictatorship and blame him for scaring off foreign investors.\u201d\n\nOn why it is taking the APC-led federal government to clear the \u2018mess\u2019 six years after, Udeh explained that democracy has its own speed, due process and checks and balances.\n\n\u201cThe outcome is gross unemployment and waste of public funds as the Federal Government was compelled to invest over N1 trillions to patch up.\n\n\u201cAccording to IMF, Nigeria yearly loses $29 billion, which is 5.8% of her GDP, due to lack of reliable power supply.\n\n\u201cAnd listen to the President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, who blamed poor electricity value chain sector for the sorry state of our industrial development,\u201d the APC leader said.\n\nHe, however, said they were happy that the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, an engineer, has an answer to the intractable problem in the electricity value chain.\n\nQuoted the power minister, Udeh said: \u201cIt must be clearly stated that within this value chain, some responsibilities are by virtue of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA) performed by our private sector partners and other agencies of government.\n\n\u201cThese partners are being monitored and sometimes given the needed nudge in the right direction to achieve our objectives. We shall be taking a careful and detailed look at issues of policy, capacity and the technical requirement, among other things.\n\n\u201cOne very critical concern that we must address in this performance monitoring process is to find out if the terms for granting the licenses were onerous.\u201d",

In the same vein, the sector constitutes an important source of local supply and service provisions to larger corporations and makes a significant contribution to the revenue profile of most financial institutions. The SME sector stimulates growth and development within the economy.\n\nNBS data\n\nAvailable data from Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that SMEs in Nigeria have contributed about 48 per cent of the national GDP in the last five years, account for 96 per cent of business and 84 per cent employment. With about 1.7 million people , the sector accounted for about 50 per cent of the industrial jobs.

The resultant effect on the economy is the increased growth of SMEs.\n\nChallenges of SMEs\n\nWithout any iota of doubt, the SMEs in the country is faced with different challenges ranging from poor capital structure, high cost of production, limited access to long term funds, poor business continuity/succession plan, weak value chain: supply, distribution, logistics, poor managerial and technical skills to lack of access to international market.\n\nThe FirstBank\u2019s FirstSME account has provided an answer to some of the SMEs challenges by its readiness and commitment to providing the Nigerian SMEs with the necessary support needed to grow their various businesses\n\nIn all, for any SMEs company to move its business to the next level- both locally and internationally-, such business owner needs to open FirstSME account to avail him/herself of all the advantages provided by First Bank of Nigeria through its SMEConnect.\n\nOperating FirstSME account is one step away from any form of distress, as all the training opportunities from SMEconnect and credit facilities embedded in the account will help to revive the company and place it on the path of growth.",

          "text": "Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund , has expressed hope that the annual allocation to the National Research Fund, NRF, will hit N10 billion in 2022.\n\nExecutive Secretary of TETFund, Professor Suleiman Bogoro, said the agency\u2019s Board of Trustees had recently approved N8.5 billion as 2021 allocation for NRF.\n\nBogoro stated this at a virtual meeting on \u2018Democratization of Higher Education in Nigeria through Open Access,\u2019 co-hosted by TETFund and the Training Centre in Communication, Nairobi, as part of activities to mark International Open Access Week.\n\nAccording to the TETFund boss, following the agency\u2019s proposal, the Board of Trustees\u2019 had in 2019 graciously approved N5 billion for NRF, which was raised to N7.5 billion in 2020 and N8.5 billion in 2021.\n\nHis words : \u201cOver the last two and half years now, we have raised funds available for research. They are two categories; institution based and National Research Fund.\n\n\u201d The institution based has a ceiling of about maybe N3,600 US dollars and it is for mainly basic research while the higher ceiling grant of about 92 or 93 US dollars is the National Research Fund aimed at promoting applied research, and to that extent, in 2019 I made case to the Board of Trustees of TETFund to increase the threshold.\n\n\u201d It used to be a kind of seed money. Seed money of N4 billion for eight years but from the year 2019 to last year and this year, we increased it to N5 billion annually. Last year we increased it from N5 billion to N7.5 billion and this year it is N8.5 billion and we are hoping in 2022 it will move to N10 billion.\n\nHe said NRF is one of the major platforms put in place by the government through TETFund to support the academic community in research to achieve specific objectives, particularly in the area of science, technology and innovation.\n\nWhile expressing the readiness of TETFund to always mainstream open access/science through massive support for Research and Development (R&D), Bogoro said the Fund had recently established 12 Centres of Excellence across the country.\n\nHe said the move was aimed at supporting cutting-edge research mainly in universities so as to provide solutions to various problems bedeviling the society as well as position Nigeria as a major player in the knowledge economy.\n\n\u201cWe are increasing emphasis on Science, Technology and Innovation to solve societal problems,\u201d Bogoro said, even as he said democratisation of higher education in Nigeria would improve more access to research and its supportive platforms to the schools and the society.\n\nBogoro, however, revealed that TETFund has developed a project impact tracking system to evaluate the correlation of its spendings on research and results so far achieved.\n\n\u201cPrecisely and coinciding with the time, we realised that we need to know the impact of our research and so we have worked on and concluding a process of software that will help us to evaluate the impact of the research grants, so that we are not just throwing money on research exercise but we need to evaluate the impact, \u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the webinar, the Technical Adviser to the TETFund\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr Popoola Mustapha Ayodele, harped on the decolonisation of education research and technology in Africa.\n\n\u201cOur educational system is still colonised, we must do away with old traditions and adopt new paradigms, the traditional practice of closed systems should be done away with,\u201d Popoola said.\n\nPopoola, who spoke on \u2018Democratisation of Higher Education in Nigeria, Open Access Landscape and TETFund\u2019s Intervention for Open Science Adoption,\u201d said the agency is leaving no stone unturned to revolutionise R&D in the country to benefit all.\n\nWhile saying TETFund\u2019s intervention lines on open science include the establishment of 12 Centres of Excellence in universities, Popoola said the agency will soon establish the second set of 12 centres to be shared equally among polytechnics and colleges of education.\n\nOn his part, the Director of Distance, Open and eLearning of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Odedina Kayode, lamented the problem of access in the Nigerian university system both in terms of materials and admission of students.\n\nOdedina said while there are 201 universities in the country, only about 30 per cent from over a million candidates that apply for admission every year scale through the hurdles.\n\nHe, however, restated NUC\u2019s commitment to take steps that will usher in easy access to materials and open learning to boost research output in the country.\n\nMr Daryl Naylor of Digital Science, who also spoke at the event, assured of the readiness of his organisation to always support open access initiatives in Africa.",

          "text": "At a public forum in Lagos in September this year, a visibly disturbed former Vice-Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Professor Dapo Asaju, challenged me and my brother minister, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God , to speak up in the face of the pall of insecurity overlooking our dear country, Nigeria, and threatening us all with a pin-down.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not enough to \u2018\u2019keep quiet\u2019\u2019 and pastor only our congregants. He wants us, among other charges, to meet President Muhammadu Buhari and tell him, \u2018\u2019Enough is enough.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe don said: \u2018\u2019All ministers of God must speak out I am looking forward to Baba Kumuyi addressing a World Conference, with Baba Adeboye seated beside him. Let them call people and say \u2018Enough is Enough.\u2019 They need to lead other people to convene a high-powered meeting with the President.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe tied his call to the Scriptures, where troublous times in ancient Israel always witnessed the emergence of faithful messengers offering Divine succor and intervention. Nigeria of this age is also under the weather, Asaju laments; she needs the clerics\u2019 cuddling and comforting care.\n\nWe cannot dismiss the concerns of Bishop Professor Asaju. The patriot that he is, he like all of us, wouldn\u2019t want the escalation of our problems to get to the boiling point of no return. If all else has failed, he seems to say, God\u2019s true representatives in the confines of His Holy Church here in Nigeria cannot fail to lead us away from the cusp pointing down to a dark abyss.\n\nHe is also right to insist that pastors must not be satisfied with the \u2018narrow\u2019 mission of entering the annals as the clergymen with the largest congregation in Africa or the world. They must worry more about the environment these worshippers go into when they are discharged from the precincts of the Church.\n\nDo they march into the deadly embrace of harlots, armed robbers, kidnappers, drug addicts, the sick, unemployed youth given to crime and hopelessness, corrupt political office holders, broken homes, occult campuses, idolatry, immorality, urban violence etc.\n\nAt Deeper Christian Life Ministry , we are far more aware of this existential crossroads than many perceive. We present the Word of God as delivered in the Holy Bible, alright.\n\nBut we warn that in the long run, the Lord is interested in a fusion of obedience to His Word and relating amicably with fellow human beings, regardless of class, colour, caste religion or culture. We teach that if you\u2019re a genuine believer in Christ, you wouldn\u2019t hate your neighbor.\n\nNor would you disdain those in power because they appear not to be delivering on electoral pledges such that you would go on the rampage, destroying government property or pillaging the public till. We teach a linear life of Christian walk: you can\u2019t be a saint on Sunday and a monster on Monday.\n\nNeedless to say, God recognizes the dual nature He has clothed us with, physical body and soul. Both need to be fed proportionally. The inner soul requires the Word, while the external body needs material fulfillments through food, shelter, healing, job, joy, justice etc.\n\nThe Creator hasn\u2019t annulled that order. He expects the state to cater for the body while He saddles the Church with providing for the inner being. None is mutually independent of the other. Societies run into straits, setbacks and storms when they neglect this arrangement.\n\nBut diligently keying into this plan as individuals, nation and Church, gives us the far-reaching blessedness of obedience to His Word. We can testify to this as we have adopted the strategy, given by Heaven, to constantly embark on Global Crusades, with the community, and not the Church, as the epicenter. The gatherings are all inclusive, nondenominational.\n\nThe limitless reach of today\u2019s smart media and Internet has enabled us to touch almost every inch of the globe. In real time audiovisual streaming, many across Nigeria, the African continent, Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia and New Zealand are able to get connected to our crusades.\n\nThose who can\u2019t make it to the viewing centres connect to me in their homes, hospitals, workplaces etc. Everywhere the Lord has been faithful to His promise to answer our prayers.\n\nAs the Lord graciously uses me to deliver His Word at these events, He never ceases to accompany the ministration with astonishing miracles of salvation, healing, restoration of hope to the despondent and deliverance of the nations from instability, insecurity and the invidious grip of the devil.\n\nWe have verifiable testimonies all over the planet underscoring the incredible power of the God of the Bible times being here with man again. He is leaping from the past to the present to prove that in any generation He doesn\u2019t forsake those who repose full faith in the finished work of Christ, in His promises and in His prophets.\n\nIn Zambia, after one of the crusades, I met a caterer, Sylvia Banda, who asked me to pray for a successful surgery on her right foot following a tendon rupture. A sharp-edged bone was growing on top of the main bone. The pain she was having was unbearable and only an operation could save her. But I told her there would be no operation, since God would heal her. I went ahead to offer a short prayer. Back in the hospital for check-up, the growth had disappeared.\n\nStill in Zambia, a lady in Lusaka, the capital, Arien Gama, received the rare miracle of the restoration of her dismembered finger. In simple faith, she pointed the challenged limb at the screen showing me at a crusade in Nigeria. The power of Heaven which recognizes no physical barriers of distances hit the finger and made it grow out again. There was no human surgery.\n\nA young man who was in the village preparing for one of my crusades learned of the death of his father. He was under pressure to stay behind for the funeral plans. But he said: \u201cI have made a pact with God to honour His invitation to the program. I can\u2019t renege.\u2019\u2019 So he came to the crusade. God also honoured the consecration of the man by bringing his father back to life during prayers while he was serving Him at the program.\n\nThese are just a few of the instances when God has deployed His Church to intervene in the affairs of the nation and its citizens and institutions.\n\nAnd as we now hold the Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State in Nigeria\u2019s south-south for another 5-day Global Crusade from Wednesday October 27, 2021, I foresee more of the Lord\u2019s focus on attending to the challenges of our nation and the countries of the world. I see Him containing the conflicts confronting His people as we pray in the Name of Jesus.",

We are focusing on the raid on Justice Mary Odili\u2019s residence, PDP\u2019s successful national convention, and Channels Television\u2019s record win at the Nigerian Media Merit Award.\n\nSubscribe here to receive this news briefing in your inbox before 6:45am (WAT) every weekday.\n\nOutrage over siege on Justice Odili\u2019s residence\n\nOn Friday, yet-to-be-identified security operatives laid siege on the Abuja residence of a Supreme Court Justice, Mary Odili, brandishing a search warrant that has been found to contain irregularities. The condemnation of the siege \u2013 from the Nigerian Bar Association and senior lawyers \u2013 has been swift.\n\nOn Sunday, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, described the incident as an assassination attempt and asked the Federal Government to act within the next 48 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, have denied any knowledge of the operation.\n\nQuotable: \u201cThe issue here has nothing to do with the Attorney General, we are happy he said he is not aware,\u201d Governor Wike said. \u201cWe said, okay since you are not aware, we are giving you 48 hours to tell us who is responsible.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari meets Tinubu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday met with fellow APC stalwart, Bola Ahmed Tinubu at the State House in Abuja. The pair had previously met in London two months ago when Tinubu was recovering from a knee surgery. After the visit, the President left for Glasgow to attend the biggest climate change event of the year, COP26.\n\nQuotable: \u201cI want to thank, first of all, the President for his visit to my residence in London after the surgery; wishing me well and lifting my spirit,\u201d Tinubu said after meeting the President. \u201cIndeed, that is what an exceptional leader will do.\u201d\n\nPDP comes up with new executives\n\nAfter overcoming legal threats, the opposition party eventually held its National Convention on Saturday (and Sunday) and was able to elect new executives to pilot its affairs.\n\nFormer Senate President, Iyorchia Ayu, perhaps unsurprisingly being a consensus candidate, emerged as the new National Chairman. And a 25-year-old, Muhammed Suleiman, was elected National Youth Leader. You can find the full list of executives here.\n\nChannels Television is Nigeria\u2019s best TV station\n\nNigeria\u2019s \u2018Home for the News\u2019 was crowned the Best Television Station of the Year for a record 14th time at the Nigerian Media Merit Awards (NMMA) on Saturday.\n\nChannels Television\u2019s Controller of Programmes, Mr Ambrose Okoh, and some senior staff members received the award on behalf of the organisation.\n\nThe NMMA award, which recognises media excellence in the country, is another proof of Channels\u2019 leading role in news and broadcasting.\n\nWhat else is happening?\n\nObinwanne Okeke: A Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered the temporary forfeiture of two houses in Abuja and two cars traced to the convicted cybercriminal, also known as Invictus Obi.\n\nNDLEA: A Federal High Court in Lagos has also permitted the drug control agency to confiscate a ship ferrying 32.9 kilograms of cocaine into Nigeria through the Apapa seaport. The agency has also arrested at least three suspects after intercepting illegal drug shipments bound for London, the United Kingdom.\n\nSERAP: The civil society organisation says it is suing President Buhari \u201cover his failure to probe allegations that over \u20a6880bn of public funds are missing from 367 ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs).\u201d\n\nSudan: Anti-coup protesters have barricaded roads in the capital city, Khartoum, as a defiant civil disobedience campaign against military takeover in the North-African nation entered its seventh day.\n\nCOP26: The epochal climate change summit opened on Sunday and summit president Alok Sharma said the event\u2019s climate negotiations are the \u201clast, best hope\u201d to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive.\n\nAfghanistan: Taliban supreme leader made his first public appearance on Sunday since taking control of the radical Islamist group in 2016.\n\nWhat to watch on YouTube\n\nAnambra: Ahead of the governorship election on November 6, the military organised a show of force in the South-East state and gunmen shot at the convoy.\n\nRubbing Minds: Popular entertainer, BasketMouth, speaks on his many projects and had a word on Nigerian development.\n\nSunday Politics: Analysts dissect the just concluded PDP National Convention.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it for this morning.
