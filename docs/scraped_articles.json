Olusoji Adediji, at the Alarere residence of the monarch on Monday.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by the Olubadan Palace.\n\nIbikunle was quoted as saying that, \u201cFor the first time in the history of Oyo State, the Office of Inter-Faith was created by Governor Seyi Makinde, and I became the pioneer officer in charge to demonstrate the open-mindedness of the governor on religious matters.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of Almighty God, I can say without fear of contradiction that there cannot be a religious crisis in the state.\n\n\u201cThe present administration in the state is passionately committed to its growth, progress, and development in every facet of human endeavour as can be attested to in the various projects being executed across the nooks and crannies of the state and could not be bogged down by religious acrimony.\u201d\n\nOba Balogun, in his brief remark, rejoiced with the Christian community over the celebration of this year\u2019s Easter and said the coincidence of the two major religions\u2019 annual fasting period was an important lesson on the oneness of religions and God, who created heaven and earth.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is the need for all adherents of different faiths to live and work harmoniously towards our country\u2019s growth, progress, and development.\n\n\u201cIt is incontrovertible that our God is only one not minding whatever names we call Him, so, why do we have to fight one another because of Him if we are genuine and sincere in our professing of him?\u201d\n\nIn his sermon, Rev. Amos Adediran, said myriad problems confronting the country were caused by a lack of love while charging leaders in all areas of life to embrace love as the only antidote to the problems being encountered as a nation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Easter celebration being held is a demonstration of the greatest love of God for mankind and it is a charge to us all, irrespective of religion which is the only mode of worship to share that virtue of unconditional love for one another for a peaceful, prosperous and progressive society.\u201d\n\nThe programme\u2019s organiser and the Palace Chaplain, Rev. Adediji, said the programme was to rejoice with Kabiyesi being his first Easter celebration on the throne and pray for him for long life, sound health, and wisdom as well as understanding with which to direct the Ibadan affairs.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

May there be an end to the flexing of muscles while people are suffering.\n\n\u201cOur hearts, too, have been filled with fear and anguish, as so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing,\u201d the Pope said.\n\nThe pontiff pointed out that two years of the coronavirus pandemic had taken \u201ca heavy toll.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was time to come out of the tunnel together, hand in hand, pooling our strengths and resources. Instead, we are showing that we still have within us the spirit of Cain, who saw Abel, not as a brother, but as a rival, and thought about how to eliminate him,\u201d he added.\n\nPope Francis sympathised with many Ukrainian victims, especially the millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, the divided families, the elderly left to themselves, the lives broken and the cities razed to the ground.\n\nHe said: \u201cI see the faces of the orphaned children fleeing from the war. May the conflict in Europe also make us more concerned about other situations of conflict, suffering and sorrow, situations that affect all too many areas of our world, situations that we cannot overlook and do not want to forget.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019ll be peaceful again, says Osinbajo\n\nVice President Osinbajo said Nigeria will be peaceful again, assuringNigerians of more prosperous future for all, regardless of current challenges.\n\nOsinbajo stated this in a chat with reporters, shortly after the Easter Sunday service at the State House Chapel, Aso Villa, Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy message is really a prayer. The resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is a defining moment for us Christians. And one of the most important things to bear in mind is the resuscitation of hope.\n\n\u201cWhere there is despair, I pray that hope would be restored, where there is fear, I pray that there is courage and confidence. Where there is deprivation, I pray that there is prosperity, and there is abundance\u201d, he said.\n\nGbajabiamila: unity is key\n\nGbajabiamila congratulated Christians, calling for unity and peace among Nigerians.\n\nHe made the call on Sunday in a statement by his media aide, Lanre Lasisi.\n\nGbajabiamila, who noted the period calls for sober reflection and dedication to nationhood, urged Christians to be their brothers\u2019 keepers at all times.\n\nThe Speaker also asked all citizens to support the government in its efforts to tackle the insecurity in the country.\n\nHe called for concerted efforts to contain insecurity across the country, noting that as a nation, Nigeria is currently facing one of its most daunting challenges.\n\nHe stated that in the spirit of Easter, Nigerians should continue to live peacefully with one another, irrespective of any perceived differences.\n\nLalong: Nigeria has bright future\n\nLalong urged Nigerians to reflect on peace, love and hope for a better Nigeria.\n\nLalong in a message to mark the event said the crucifixion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is at the centre of the Christian faith, guarantees victory because despite the agony Jesus passed through, his sufferings brought emancipation and redemption to mankind.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to embrace the lessons of Christ\u2019s sacrifice and teachings which speak of resilience, love, patience and determination to overcome evil and provide better situation.\n\nThe governor said the current security situation and other challenges call for determination and collaboration among all Nigerians to work together to defeat the forces of evil who are bent on causing pain and agony to the innocent citizens.\n\nLalong said just like Jesus overcame death and liberated mankind, Nigeria will overcome the current phase of insecurity and destruction being perpetrated by criminals, who place little value on human life.\n\nLalong, in a statement by his spokesman, Dr. Makut Simon Macham, called on the people to be security conscious and report any suspicious movement of persons or activity to security agencies to forestall any breakdown of law and order.\n\nIshaku seeks citizens support on fight against insecurity\n\nIshaku called on residents to support government\u2019s efforts at fighting insecurity.\n\nThe governor also called for extra vigilance on the part of the people to check the alarming spate of kidnappings, killings and other forms of crimes and criminality.\n\nThis is contained in the Easter message issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Bala Dan-Abu, in Jalingo.\n\nIshaku advised the people to report suspicious persons visiting the state to security agencies for prompt action.\n\nWhile felicitating Christians in Taraba, Nigeria and the world at large on the anniversary of the death and resurrection of Christ, Ishaku reminded Christians of Christ\u2019s acts of compassion and forgiveness.\n\nAbdulRazaq preaches reunion\n\nKwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq called on Nigerians to seek God\u2019s favour for the country.\n\nThe governor made the appeal in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to reunite against all forces of evil seeking to terrorise people and tear the country apart with violence and economic sabotage.\n\nAbdulRazaq described Easter as the season of reunion, self-discipline, sacrifice, forgiveness and commitment to God.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us come together to fight all forces of evil that work against peace and development this Easter and beyond.\n\n\u201cI wish everyone greater strides and glad tidings as we recommit ourselves to a better Nigeria and stronger ties as a community of people, bound by common destiny.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu preaches harmony\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu urged Nigerians to emulate Christ\u2019s virtues of humility, perseverance and compassion.\n\nThe governor also urged Christians to continue to live in peace and harmony with people of other faiths, noting that good neighbourliness, selflessness and patience were among the lessons taught and exemplified by our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, implored Nigerians, especially Christians, to seek the face of God for continuous peace in Lagos State, an end to insurgency and other insecurity challenges in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs Christians, this period offers us an opportunity to rethink our relationships as individuals, as communities and as a nation. The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ typifies love, affection and tolerance. It also marked the end of evil and the beginning of good deeds. I want to urge us to emulate the virtues of Jesus Christ by positively impacting the lives of friends, colleagues, associates, neighbours and family members.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate this year\u2019s Easter, I want to urge Christian faithful in the state to continue to pray for continuous peace in our dear State, Lagos and end to insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, insurgency and other insecurities.\u201d\n\nFayemi: emulate Jesus\n\nFayemi congratulated Christiansvfor witnessing another Easter season.\n\nThe Governor, in his Easter message by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, urged Christians to emulate the sacrificial lifestyle of Jesus Christ, who gave his life to save mankind.\n\nFayemi, who felicitated Christians for the successful completion of the Lenten season, urged them to continue to intercede for the state and the country.\n\nThe Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) noted that the Easter season is a period of sober reflection, which lessons should be imbibed and reflected on at all times.\n\nHe said such fundamental values would go a long way in promoting and strengthening the foundation of love, peace, harmony and progress in the country, adding that the season should serve as a reminder to the selflessness, love, sacrifice and tolerance of Jesus Christ throughout His earthly sojourn, death and resurrection.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must see this period as a time that presents us the viable opportunity to reflect on how we can help to steer our nation back on the road to peace, stability and prosperity, by living peacefully with fellow citizens.\u201d\n\nKaigama: avoid immorality\n\nThe Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop, Rev. Ignatius Kaigama described Christ\u2019s resurrection as victory of life over death, hope over despair and love over hatred.\n\nKaigama said this in his homily at the Our Lady Queen of Nigeria Pro-Cathedral in Abuja.\n\nKaigama advised Christians to shun sad, fake and bad news.\n\nHe also warned against following the world invaded by the virus of immorality and acts causing hopelessness and needless pains.\n\nRev. Kaigama said: \u201cAmidst the religious and political voices of hatred and violence, Muslims and Christians, whose Ramadan and Easter coincide this year again, should go beyond mutual courteous felicitations to be instruments of fostering social harmony and peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cNigerians should rather speak and act against corruption, injustice and greed; doing everything to overcome ethno-religious and socio-political hostilities.\n\n\u201cThe brutal killings, kidnappings, immoral and anti-social activities in different parts of Nigeria are brought about by the cumulative effect of sins in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe implore the Risen Lord to have mercy on us, to liberate us and the whole world from insecurity and agonies caused by man\u2019s inhumanity to man.\n\n\u201cMay Jesus transform our situations, satisfy our hungers, quench our thirsts, heal our sick world.\n\n\u201cMay God wipe away our tears, and restore our buried hopes and aspirations, and above all, give us the peace that only God can give,\u201d he said.\n\nPresbyterian Church calls for dialogue with agitators\n\nThe Prelate of the Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, Most Rev Nzie Nsi Eke, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to objectively look into the various ethnic agitations and douse the tension through sincere dialogue and positive engagement.\n\nRev Eke, who made the call in his Easter Message, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to also ensure a smooth political transition next year through fair, credible and transparent elections that are devoid of violence and rancor.\n\nHe also urged Mr. Buhari to end the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike to safeguard the future of the youths.\n\nHe lamented the state of insecurity in the country, pointing out that Nigerians are no longer safe anywhere.\n\nAccording to him, no matter how far the situation has degraded or deteriorated, there is still hope for the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor some years now, the nation has been praying and hoping for better days but this hope keep turning out to be an illusion. Instead of getting better, the Nigerian social and political situations are getting worse by the day.\n\n\u201cI wonder how Nigerians are surviving the prevailing high cost of living. All the basic goods and services which people have taken for granted as being parts of life are almost out of reach because of their unaffordable costs.\n\n\u201cNigerians are lamenting because they can no longer afford the cost of petrol, kerosene, diesel, domestic gas, rice, beans, yam, garri, meat, fish, house rent, school fees, transportation, vehicles, clothing, electrical appliances, etc.\n\n\u201cAdded to this state of pain is the deteriorating security situation in the country. T o say the least, Nigerians are no longer safe anywhere within the nation due to the seemingly intractable activities of bandits who operate as terrorists, hoodlums, kidnappers, armed robbers, militant agitators and religious extremists.\n\n\u201cAs we remember and try to empathize with the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are constrained to admit that Nigeria is in pains and reproach at this time. The people are hurting.\n\n\u2018Our children in higher institutions are at home, with their future being mortgaged, because of perennial industrial actions by their lecturers. The ethnic tension in the country is still pervading with some parts of the Southeast being shut down frequently with people forced to stay at home or go out for their legitimate businesses at the risk of their live and properties\u201d.\n\nHe charged Nigerians to keep to keep praying, trust God and support all the good efforts of governments.\n\nRev. Eke added: \u201cWe also must not be afraid to speak out against injustice, bad government and the evils of the society. The nation must come back to righteousness and the ways of God.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai: good will triumph over evil\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the face of the challenges confronting the country.\n\nHe said that good will triumph over evil.\n\nEl-Rufai said: \u201cIn these difficult times, the example set by Jesus Christ, the pain, the sacrifice, the triumph and the message of hope echo with timeless resonance.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement he personally signed, El-Rufai said: \u201cAs people of faith, let us continue to practice in our daily lives the lessons of sacrifice, care for the poor, deep spiritual reflection and love for all humankind, irrespective of tribe or religion, observed during the fasting.\n\n\u201cEaster symbolises the triumph of hope over despair and an affirmation that darkness cannot trump the plans and wishes of Almighty God. Jesus Christ set an example of sacrifice that has moved men and women through the ages.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the triumph of Christ, let us embrace all the lessons of Easter, never losing faith in the will of Almighty God, and the triumph of good over evil. Let us uphold each other in our common humanity and pray for peace in our land. Let us do our best to promote harmony in our communities and reject strife in our land. Let hope never depart from our hearts.\n\n\u201cI call on everyone who calls Kaduna State home to work together to uphold our state, its hardworking people and their accomplishments from those who seek to menace and destroy.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu to politicians: thread with caution\n\nAbia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu urged the political class to thread with caution ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\n\nIkpeazu in a goodwill Easter message assured Abians that a better and more prosperous tomorrow was assured, judging by the available positive macroeconomic indices.\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu assured Abians that he remains irrevocably committed to their welfare, even as the State grapples with scare resources.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe have, by the kindness of God, kept our state peaceful and safe, when compared to our neighbors.\n\n\u201cI therefore, appeal to our politicians to be mindful of these as they plan to go into full scale politicking.\n\n\u201cAny acts capable of plunging our dear state into avoidable chaos must be avoided. The peace and security of our people must remain the most paramount consideration.\u201d\n\nYero: be optimistic\n\nFormer Kaduna State Governor Mukhtar Yero called on Nigerians to remain optimistic about tomorrow, inspite of the present challenges.\n\nYero in his Easter message personally signed by him in Kaduna said: \u201cAs we celebrate this year\u2019s Easter and reminisce on the sacrifice and love that the season embodies, I felicitate with all the Christian faithful in Kaduna and beyond.\n\n\u201cI urge us all to continue to remain optimistic about the potential of our state and Country, let us also continue to pray for peace and oneness among us. Let our humanity defines and bind us together before the considerations.\n\nHe said, It is oneness and love for each other that would continue to create the peaceful environment needed for our growth and development.\n\n\u201cA happy Easter Celebration to us all and May God bless our state and country.\u201d",

          "text": "All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant Asiwaju Bola Tinubu yesterday urged Nigerians to rededicate themselves to the task of nation-builidng \u201cas never before\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet us reach out to one another as never before and, together, build our lives and this nation as never before,\u201d he said in his Easter message to the country.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor said Nigeria will overcome its challenges.\n\nTinubu said in the contest between what is good and bad, \u201cwhat is right and human shall win\u201d.\n\nUrging Nigerias to treat each other \u201cas God intended brothers and sisters to be\u201d, he said \u201cin the process, we shall build a better and more just society\u201d.\n\nReflecting on the current national challenges, the eminent politician said some critics have deluded themselves into thinking that the country has failed and \u201ccan no longer be good\u201d.\n\nTinubu said they restricted themselves to their opinion because they underrated the resilience and power of Nigeria to triumph.\n\nHe said: Sceptic and critics have written us off. They say we have failed and can no longer be good. They are wrong because they do not know us. Yes, challenges face us. But, we also face them. And we shall face them down.\n\nTinubu, in the statement personally signed by him, said the country should be grateful to God for his mercies and benevolence.\n\nHe said as Christians in Nigeria and the world over celebrated the joyous occasion, all people should take a precious moment to reflect on the profound meaning of the day.\n\nUrging Nigerians to imbibe the lessons, Tinubu said: \u201cEaster speaks to a remarkable, triumphant rebirth after tremendous struggle and ordeal. It teaches a crucial lesson: In the contest of peace versus strife, good versus evil, and love versus hate, darkness may come and, for a time, seem to win. But ultimately, what is right and humane shall win.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cJesus sacrificed himself for the wellbeing of others. For his goodness, he was ridiculed, tried, and convicted in the worst of ways. The wrongdoers thought they defeated him. They indeed were wrong. He overcome their cruelty to achieve that which he was brought into this world to achieve. He withstood so much to reach his destiny. In so doing, he brought forth a new faith that has been the fountain of spiritual uplift to billions of people for over two centuries.\n\n\u201cTo the extent possible, we must try to emulate his morals and ethics in our personal and public lives. His devotion and selflessness, we must imitate. His sense of justice, we must reflect. Jesus\u2019s compassion for all and his special love for the downcast and downtrodden, we must revere and honor in all that we do.\n\n\u201cThis goes for each of us as individual Nigerians. It equally goes for us as a nation. Skeptics and critics have written us off. They say we have failed and can no longer be good. They are wrong because they do not know us. Yes, challenges face us, but we also face them. And we shall face them down.\n\n\u201cWe take heart in the life and lessons of Jesus. The extent to which we learn these lessons, is the extent that Nigeria shall enjoy a rebirth and claim its greater triumph.\n\n\u201cWe have not and cannot falter. Our nation\u2019s best still lies ahead.\n\n\u201cOn this Easter, I join my Christian brothers and sisters in celebrating the example and teachings of Jesus. Let us reach out to one another as never before and, together, build our lives and this nation as never before.\n\n\u201cMay God give us the wisdom and commitment to improve this land as He intended. May our service to Him and to mankind be of the compassion, peace, selflessness, and devotion to a higher purpose that Jesus demonstrated.\n\n\u201cLet us give the best of ourselves that we may achieve the reward of a better nation for all.\n\n\u201cLet us treat each other as God intended brothers and sisters to be. In the process, we shall build a better and more just society. Let the spirit of this special season live with and in us throughout the year.\n\n\u201cA happy and peaceful Easter to you all.

He warned that anything short of that would be resisted.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have not said and I will not say that Sen Abe must be the candidate of APC in Rivers State. I have always said that if we have a fair, free, transparent, inclusive and equitable contest and somebody emerges from that process, as a democrat, I will support whoever emerges in that contest and the person will win.\n\n\u201cBut, if you go and cook up a process to exclude me, it will not work. They cannot decide for Rivers people, Rivers people will decide for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a riverine or upland candidate. What we need is a Rivers candidate that is known by Rivers people with the capacity and integrity to deliver.\n\n\u201cThat is why I, Senator Magnus Ngei Abe will contest for the gubernatorial ticket of the APC in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cLet me advise the party; we have been through this road many times; we should not make the same mistake again. There should be an end to political rascality in Rivers State. We should not disregard the people and expect a good result.\n\nFormer Rivers State Attorney-General Worgu Boms, described Abe as the most qualified for the job, saying the APC would have gone into extinction without him.\n\nAkpanudoedehe joins race in Akwa Ibom\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, former National Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe also declared to run at the weekend.\n\nHe made the declaration in Uyo during a grand reception organised in his honour by his supporters from the 31 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe occasion attracted leaders of the party.

We have been battered with lies. What bothers me is how to liberate my people from suffering. I am that special vehicle that can take you people away from poverty.\u201d\n\nGiadom admonished leaders of the party in the state to desist from infighting capable of robbing the party of victory in the coming elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want leaders of the party to unite and confront the common enemy, the PDP.

They are reorganising with new technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that in the coming weeks, people will see the real difference. We\u2019re hoping incidents, such as the rail bombing, will never again happen,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nOn success recording in Northeast, he said: \u201cVirtually all the major roads in Borno State have been re-opened. All the major markets have been re-opened.\n\n\u201cTrading across the border has resumed and if you see what the international terrorism index indicated recently, more than 90 per cent of Boko Haram terrorism is no longer happening.\n\n\u201cSo, that is to say, that things are happening and Nigerians should appreciate the fact that the military, the intelligence and the police are working hard and they are getting results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not denying that there has been a spike recently in some states, particularly Kaduna, Plateau, Niger Benue, and to some extent, Zamfara, which has witnessed a calming down of the situation for some time.\n\n\u201cEssentially, you\u2019re talking about the government\u2019s success in degrading sustainable threats, such as Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cThat is not to say that there are not occasional threats; they might strike from time to time and this is in the nature of symmetric warfare.\n\n\u201cBut the government is preparing well, is planning well, is making acquisitions \u2013 drone technology, airpower.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been given approval by the Americans to buy nearly $1 billion worth of military hardware \u2013 12 helicopters.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re getting somewhere and you know that the Super Tucanos have come; the drones, we have got two more.\n\n\u201cThey were being assembled and the operators were being trained. All of these things are being hastened.\n\n\u201cChanges have happened in commands in the manning of this dangerous axis and the results will show.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigerians should be patient with the administration. We are getting results. It may take time, but we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\n\u2018Abducted train victims will be freed\u2019\n\nThe Presidency appealed to families of those taken hostage from the train attack to be patient as the government works to secure their freedom.\n\nShehu said: \u201cRelatives of those taken as hostages by the terrorists, speaking during a media briefing in Kaduna on Friday, had told Federal Government not to resume the Abuja-Kaduna train service until those being held had been set free from captivity.\n\n\u201cGovernment has already fixed the rail tracks. They\u2019ve been tested and ready to resume train service.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is also concern about family members who are holding up this process and they insist that their family members must be brought home from the bandits before the service is restored.\n\n\u201cYou can understand the emotion, and the government doesn\u2019t want to appear to be insensitive.\n\n\u201cBut again, by stopping this rail service, you\u2019re also in a way exposing other families who have not been so affected by other dangers.\n\n\u201cThere must be a meeting point and I\u2019m sure that the security and intelligence community, with the police, will be able to work with the family members to reassure them that they will not be abandoned and that their family members will not be abandoned to their fate.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesman explained why such rescue operations may take time.\n\n\u201cIf the idea is to just bomb out everyone \u2013 the bandits, the terrorists and their captives, this can be done in a day.\n\n\u201cBut this is a rescue operation and rescue will only be successful when you bring people out alive and well.\n\n\u201cIf they are brought back in body bags, what\u2019s the purpose?\n\n\u201cThe family members should please bear with the administration as it works to ensure that the people who are trained to deal with this situation, give the direction on what to do,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nDeclare emergency on security, says Senator\n\nAlso yesterday, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Cooperation and Integration in Africa/ NEPAD Chimaroke Nnamani, urged the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on security.\n\nThe former Enugu State governor, who represents Enugu East, in an Easter message, said: \u201cThere is no use pretending or shying away from the fact that Nigerians are no longer safe in their homes, workplaces, schools, worship centres, roads and everywhere.\n\n\u201cWe must, therefore, take the necessary steps to declare an emergency on the security situation.\n\n\u201cAll hands must be on deck to tackle the situation headlong but the government must lead the way.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Presidency said there was ongoing re-equipment and reorganisation of the security and intelligence forces.\nYesterday, Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese Matthew Kukah slammed the Federal Government for allegedly failing to halt the worsening security situation.\nDescribing the security system as \u201cbroken\u201d, he accused the government of prioritising the integration of repentant terrorists over freeing kidnap victims.\nQuoting the international terrorism index, he said the Northeast security crisis, which the administration inherited, had been degraded by 90 per cent.\n\u201cHowever, there is also concern about family members who are holding up this process and they insist that their family members must be brought home from the bandits before the service is restored.",

That is why I have a few awards in my office or in my house, not because I was not offered, but because I hardly accept. For me, each one I accept is worth over 100 awards. This is because I believe we should only be given awards for justified reasons.\n\n\u201cWhen I received your nomination letter, I reckoned that The Sun is critical to nation-building. So, I said definitely, there must have been very exhaustive deliberations before you arrived at that choice.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Because I was in the opposition, I had a lot of information, especially when I served as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee; between 2007 and 2015.\n\n\u201cBut, within my limits, I was very conscious of what my nation demanded of me. Politics apart, there is always the need for every politician to know the limit you can take opposition to because you have to have a nation first.

While in the opposition, you sustained a radical approach to law making by speaking truth to power.\n\n\u201cSince your election as Senate president, which makes you the chairman of the National Assembly, you have brought dynamism to the upper legislative chamber. Under your watch, the National Assembly has ensured that the country returned to the right budget cycle.\n\n\u201cOn October 15, 2019, the Senate under your leadership passed the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill 2019. The passage of that Bill raised over $500 million used by the Executive arm of government in funding the 2020 budget. Today, over $1.9 billion has been realised from that initiative.\n\n\u201cYour maturity has translated into many achievement of the 9th National Assembly within a short period including the harmonious relationship with the executive arm of government.\n\nThe Sun Awards 2021 holds on May 7, 2022 at the Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nThe other award winners are, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and Chairman, BUA Group, Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu (Man of the Year), Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State (Governor of the Year), Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State (Courage in Leadership) and Mrs. Nkechi Ikpeazu, First Lady of Abia State (Most Supportive First Lady).\n\nOthers are Gbenga Shobo, MD, First Bank Nigeria and Emmanuel Mbaka, MD, Platinum Mortgage Bank (Banker of the Year), Senator Uche Ekwunife and Dr. Toyin Saraki ( Humanitarian Service Icon); Dr. Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour & Employment and Hon Chibuike Amaechi, Minister of Transportation (Public Service Icon) and star actress, Destiny Etiko (Nollywood Personality).\n\nIn the business categories, the following are winners: Ebuka Okafor, Chairman, Vixa Pharmaceutical and Emmanuel Iheagwazi, Chairman, Climax Lubricants Industries (Industrialist of the Year), Dr. Charles Mba, Chairman, CDV Properties and Development Limited and Okey Nzenwa, Chairman, Pan-Marine Investment Limited (Investor of the Year) as well as Alhaji Auwalu Rano, Chairman, AA Rano and Benson Madubuko, Chairman, De Chico Group (Entrepreneur of the Year)\n\nOther winners are High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Chief Bisi Akande and Col Sani Bello (retd) (Lifetime Achievement), Daniel Igali, Bayelsa State Commissioner for Sports (Sports Personality) and Augustine Okoro, chairman, Corinthia Hotel & Suites (Hospitality Personality).",

          "text": "Funmi Ogundare\n\nThe management of Chrisland schools has explained why it had to suspend some students over a sex tape which went viral on social media.Some students from the private school located in Victoria Garden City, who were in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for the World School Games in March were involved in immoral acts in a trending video on social media.\n\n\n\nThis school\u2019s explanation is coming after the Lagos State government ordered that all branches of the school in the state be shut down.Surprisingly, the school was silent on the action taken against the staff members in whose care the children were at the time of the incident during the trip to Dubai The management had earlier suspended an 11-year-old female pupil said to have been gang raped, claiming that the girl took part in a truth-or-dare game in Dubai where the students represented the school in the World School Games between March 8 and 14, 2022.The school announced the girl\u2019s suspension in a letter to her parent, describing her conduct as improper behaviour.However, the mother of the girl has called on Nigerians to help her seek justice for her daughter, whom she said the school was trying to silence her daughter in order to cover up the immoral incident.\n\n\n\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY on Monday, a member, Advisory Board of the school, Mr. Akin Fadeyi, said it was scandalised and distressed over the issue, adding that it meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. He added that it was also to caution students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences. According to him, \u201cThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform or children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cThe school, he noted, had taken a critical view of the number of students who participated in this trip to Dubai and who did the school proud in its quest to expand the horizons of its students holistically through global exposure, adding that it takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements. Of the 76 children who represented Chrisland, Fadeyi said 71 ensured an untainted adherence to its standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. \u201cWithin these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and boys on the fourth floor, to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands.\u201dFadeyi reassured that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place under its watch saying, \u201cwhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Urges South-east to focus on \u2018what can\u2019t lie\u2019\n\n*Says tales about marabouts predicting his presidency surprising\n\n*Kukah to Buhari: You have divided Nigerians along ethnic, religion, regional lines\n\n\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nFormer vice president and presidential hopeful in the 2023 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, at the weekend, said what Nigeria needed after seven years of ineptitude of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was a leader who could bring together diversity in unity and encourage the people to respect and accept each other, despite their differences. Atiku said Nigeria needed a \u201cunifier, not a pacifier\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe spoke exclusively to THISDAY in the first of a presidential interview series being conducted by this newspaper.\n\nThis was just as the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, yesterday accused the Buhari\u2019s administration of having, \u201cdivided our people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that we have never witnessed in our history.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe former vice president further reacted to the issue of zoning, saying the South-east should focus on what cannot lie, that is his record, \u201cMy attitude towards them. My history with them.\u201d\n\nHe did not miss an opportunity to sell his candidacy and vision, but dismissed tales about marabouts predicting he would be president someday as the reason he had held on to the dream tenaciously. He said the story remained a surprise to him, too.\n\n\n\nSpeaking directly to some of the issues defining the state of the nation on the journey to 2023, Atiku said, \u201cI think after seven years of incompetence, Nigerians just want competence. Where it comes from, they do not mind.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that we face today have so focused us on the need to elect leaders based on their competence, instead of their region or religion. Nigeria needs a unifier, not a pacifier. We will be pacified by unity. We will not be united by pacification.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn insinuations about a groundswell of opinion against his recurrent presidential bids, especially suggestions that the people might be tired of seeing his face on the ballot, Atiku said, \u201cThat is a fallacy. There is no groundswell, to use your word. Yes, there are people who have large megaphones, but they do not constitute a groundswell.\n\n\u201cSome of these people have emotional and historic reasons for making their appeals, and one must be sensitive to them. That is why I have gone round and keep going round this country to consult. I believe in the politics of addition. I am not a subtracting politician.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the mounting sentiments in favour of a Nigerian president of South-east origin in 2023, he stated, \u201cOf course it is in order. Have you forgotten how passionate I have been in advocating for the South-east? Look at my record.\n\n\u201cWhat the South-east has to understand is that people\u2019s records matter more than people\u2019s rhetoric. I ask my beloved people of the South-east to focus on what cannot lie; my record. My attitude towards them. My history with them.\u201d\n\n\n\nDismissing speculations that marabouts played a role in his presidential aspiration, Atiku said, \u201cEven me, I am surprised when people bandy about these types of beer parlour myths. I am a devout Muslim. My principles do not allow for anything other than total submission to the will of God.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a myth put together by my political opponents to achieve whatever ends they wanted to achieve. That is just like saying Reagan and Churchill kept trying multiple times because they were powered by soothsayers. It may interest you to know that I became governor after four attempts. Tenacity is a virtue. It is not a vice. It should be celebrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nTalking about moves for consensus approach in selecting the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) , Atiku contended, \u201cI just believe that no man should be a judge in his own case. Let\u2019s go down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2010-2011, the North chose to go that route. However, it was not the aspirants who elected on their own to come up with a consensus candidate. It was the region. Specifically, the Northern Political Leaders\u2019 Forum led by the late Malam Adamu Ciroma.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the North as a region wants that option, then, it should be driven by our natural leaders and elders. It should not be promoted by partisans. Once it becomes like that, then, it may become a poisoned chalice.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing the issue if zoning, Atiku said, \u201cI will add this: the Peoples Democratic Party, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning!\u201d\n\n\n\nOn why he still wanted to be president of Nigeria after five \u201cfailed attempts\u201d, he said, \u201cPlease, allow me the liberty of rephrasing your question. I would rather say, after several attempts. They were not failed attempts, as I have already explained above.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the year 2022, Nigeria is the world headquarters for extreme poverty, and the third most insecure nation in the world. Our economy is not growing, while our population is expanding.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you now look at my record in government, where under the leadership of President Obasanjo, I was the chairman of the National Council on Privatisation, and a coordinator of our economic management team, you can clearly see my achievements.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose achievements need to be replicated if we are to turn the tide. In fact, it is almost as if providence thrust me out this time to do again what God had enabled me to do before.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe provided jobs. Nigerians are now unemployed in record numbers. We paid off Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt. Nigeria is now more indebted than at any time in our history. Through our policies and inclusiveness, we had relative peace.\n\n\u201cNow, Nigeria is in crisis due to insecurity. It would look to me that my curriculum vitae or my resume appears tailor-made to address the challenges we now face as a nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAtiku spoke on the corruption allegations against him, saying, \u201cThank God you said allegations. Anybody can allege. You know the history of this country and what specifically I went through. All that is now in the past. What I will say, however, is that I am the most investigated politician in Nigeria; yet, nothing has been established against me. I have received a clean bill of health with regard to the allegations raised against me.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat alone should tell you something. It speaks volumes. In the attempt to stop me, knowing that my plans are sound, my ideology is solid and stable, and my connection to Nigerians is enduring, the only thing that my political opponents could use against me are false allegations. My only answer to that is that I have judicially been exonerated and vindicated of all of them.\u201d\n\n\n\nKukah to Buhari: You Have Divided Nigerians Along Ethnic, Religion, Regional Lines\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Kukah, in his Easter Message to the Church and Nigerians, made available to THISDAY, said the problems and challenges currently facing Nigeria were beyond the 2023 elections.\n\nHe lamented that the government had made Nigerians vulnerable and, \u201cignited the most divisive form of identity consciousness among the people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe years of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping. Notwithstanding these challenges, religious leader must recover to deploy their moral authority and avoid falling victims to the schemes of politicians and their material enticements,\u201d the Catholic Bishop said.\n\n\n\nHe disclosed that the values of interfaith dialogue have come under severe strain and pressure, \u201cwith extremists from both sides of our faiths denigrating the idea of dialogue with their counterparts of other faiths.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnorance and miseducation have combined with prejudice to create the falsehood that somehow, one religion is superior to the others.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith so many ill equipped fraudsters posing as religious leaders, there is an obsession with defaming the others and widening our differences,\u201d Kukah added.\n\n\n\nHe said religious leaders must face the reality, \u201cthat here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam. While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful who are marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the last few years, we have had some good news from outside the shores of Nigeria. The most noteworthy is the initiative undertaken by both Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, Egypt, Shaikh Mohammed Al-Tayeb in 2019, when both of them met and signed the Document on Human Fraternity.\n\n\n\n\u201cPope Francis followed up with the publication of an Encyclical titled, \u2018Fratelli Tutti, We are all Brothers,\u2019 in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe following year, the United Nation\u2019s General Assembly declared February 4, World Day of Fraternity. Both leaders agreed that: \u2018We need to develop the awareness that nowadays, we are either all saved together or no one is saved. Poverty, decadence, and suffering in one part of the earth are a silent breeding ground for problems that will end up affecting our entire planet.\u201d\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Kukah said, \u201cWe need to start thinking of a Nigeria beyond banditry and kidnapping and the endless circles of violence that have engulfed our communities and nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to pretend that there are no religious undertones to the violence in the name of God that has given our religions a bad name. The way out is for the state to enforce the secular status of the Nigerian state so as to give citizens the necessary freedoms from the shackles of semi-feudal confusion over the status of religion and the state in a plural democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must be ready to embrace modernity and work out how to preserve our religions and cultures without turning religion into a tool for tyranny, exclusion, and oppression.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe maintained that, \u201cin finding our way forward, the President must concede that it is within his powers to decide how we are going to end the war that has engulfed and is tearing down our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems that the federal government has shown far greater commitment to integrating so called repentant terrorists than getting our children back from kidnappers or keeping our universities open. Earlier last month, Operation Safe Corridor announced that it had graduated 599 members of various terrorist groups who have acquired new skills and are now ready to be integrated into society.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total comes to over a thousand now. It is plausible to note that the programme involves pyscho-social support, rehabilitation, vocational training, skill acquisition and start-ups.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite all these, the larger issue is that their various communities have expressed their reluctance to receive their erring sons back. Nigerians have no access to the transcripts of the texts of the confessions of these terrorists not to talk of evidence of their commitment to not sin again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have only the words of the terrorists and the same military that they have been fighting a war with. It speaks volumes when the President and his military hierarchy choose to believe these young men who took up arms and for years waged war against their country, killed, maimed and wasted thousands of lives, destroyed entire communities and now, they are being housed, fed, clothed with public funds,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kukah, \u201call this while their victims have been forced to make the various IDP camps their new homes! Where is the justice for the victims and the rest of the country they have destroyed.\u201d\n\nHe said as a priest, he cannot be against a repentant sinner or criminals changing their ways, noting that, \u201cafter all, the doors of forgiveness must always remain open.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, in this case, Nigerians have very little information as to the entire rehabilitation processes.\n\n\u201cHave these terrorists felt the heat or have they seen the light or, is their repentance a mere strategic and tactical repositioning? So far, we have no evidence that these terrorists have been able to confront their victims not to talk of seeking forgiveness from them. Something is wrong. We see these terrorists adorned in our national colours in their green and white kaftans, trousers, and looking like heroes of the state!\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we to assume that they have become acknowledged models for Nigerian youth? Perhaps the next graduating set might be treated to Presidential handshakes, receptions at the villa with full national colours.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the unfolding event have vindicated his criticism of this government, saying that last week, in solidarity with him, the Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam, JNI, in a statement stated that: \u2018It appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place\u2026.our humanity is being eroded and that erosion is become a new normal.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition, Kukah pointed out that the Northern Elders Forum and the House of Representatives recently called on the president to resign since, in their view it was now clear that he cannot protect his citizens.\n\n\u201cThis has come three years after the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Statement issued on April 26th, 2018 made the same call that was greeted with cynicism,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nThe cleric stated further that the challenge of fixing, \u201cthis broken nation is enormous and, as I have said, requires joint efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith everything literally broken down, our country has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy. Our individual hearts are broken; our family dreams are broken; homes are broken; churches, mosques, infrastructure are broken.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur educational system is broken; our children\u2019s lives and future are broken; our politics is broken; our economy is broken; our energy system is broken; our security system is broken; our roads and rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bishop, \u201cas 2023 beckons and the stage is set, the next president of Nigeria must be a man or woman with a heart, a sense of empathy and a soul on fire that can set limits to what human indignities visited on citizens that he or she can tolerate.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have no need for any further empty messianic rhetoric laced with deceitful and grandiose religiosity. We need someone who can fix our broken nation, rid our people of the looming dangers of hunger and destitution.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur presidential aspirants must show evidence from their legacies and antecedents that they know the country well enough and its severe wounds. Whoever wants to govern us must illustrate that he or she understands what is on ground.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe thanked the president for accepting the report of the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy and granting pardon to over 150 Nigerians serving various terms of imprisonment.\n\nHowever, Kukah noted that more serious challenge was to immediately free all innocent Nigerians who are held captive and whose only crime was that they are living in Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Bishop congratulated Christians, saying the Easter celebration brings hope and restoration.\n\nHe further explained that Easter was a fulfilment of what the Jesus Christ had foretold when he said, \u201cunless a grain of wheat falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain, but if it dies, it bears much fruit.\u201d\n\nKukah stressed that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to the Christian faith.\n\n\n\nHe noted that the greatest challenges facing the country was how to begin a processes of reconstructing, \u201cour nation hoping on and to survive the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real challenge before us now is to look beyond politics and face the challenge of forming characters, faith in our country that many have lost confidence in,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nFollowing their aggressive expansion into other African countries, Europe, and Asia, the subsidiaries of United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), Access Bank Plc, Zenith Bank Plc and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GTBank) raked in about 29.5 per cent of their combined profit before tax in their 2021 financial year ended December 31, 2021, from their foreign subsidiaries, compared with the 23.3 per cent contribution to profit before tax recorded by the four banks in their 2020 audited financial statement.\n\n\n\nAccording to data compiled by THISDAY, in terms of value, the four banks\u2019 foreign subsidiaries generated N245.47 billion, which was an increase by 43 per cent, compared with the N171.83 billion recorded in 2020.\n\nData gathered from the banks\u2019 audited financial statements revealed that UBA, with presence in 20 African countries, a pension custodian subsidiary and branch in United Kingdom generated earnings from its foreign subsidiaries in 2021.\n\n\n\nUBA\u2019s subsidiaries generated profit before tax of N100.23 billion in 2021, up from N71.57 billion in 2020, while Access Bank with subsidiaries in Gambia. Sierra Leone, Zambia, UK, Ghana, Rwanda, D.R.Congo, Guinea, Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya and Botswana generated N67.7 billion profit before tax in 2021, from N35,73billion in 2020.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, the foreign subsidiaries of GTBank with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia. Gambia, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Kenya Group, Tanzania and UK generated profit before tax of N45.4billion in 2021, higher than N22.96 billion in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe contribution of the foreign subsidiaries to the Group performance of GTCO revealed significant contribution from the West African countries.\n\n\n\nAlso, the subsidiaries of Zenith Bank\u2019s subsidiaries in Africa, Europe, Dubai and China generated N32.17 billion profit before tax in 2021, up from N41.56 billion in 2020. Zenith Bank, which is the most profitable bank in Nigeria had reported N280.37 billion profit before tax in 2021 from N255.86 billion in 2020, with Nigeria contributing about 94.8 per cent or N265.91 billion in 2021, up from 85.32 per cent or N218.3billion in 2020.\n\n\n\nZenith Bank had also revealed that its foreign subsidiaries contributed 12 per cent of its total revenue in 2021, from 13.9 per cent in 2020, while Nigeria contributed 88 per cent in 2021 from 86.1 per cent in 2020.\n\nHowever, except for Access Bank that reported significant increase in profit before tax in 2021 from its United Kingdom subsidiary, three other banks struggled in the UK.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Access Bank in 2021 reported N22.63 billion profit before tax in 2021 from N7.27 billion in 2020, from its UK subsidiary, while GTBank UK reported a loss of N1.16 billion in 2021 from a loss of N1.62 billion in 2020. Also, Zenith Bank UK\u2019s profit before tax dropped to N4.93 billion in 2021 from N7.6 billion in 2020, while UBA UK Limited reported a loss of N428 million in 2021 from N1.41billion reported in 2020.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to analysts and investors on the group performance in 2021, recently, the Group Managing Director, Access Bank, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, revealed that in 2021, the growth in its subsidiaries have continued to grow.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSubsidiaries\u2019 contribution to the group\u2019s profit before tax performance stood at 38 per cent compared to 28 per cent in the corresponding period last year, and of course recording total subsidiary PBT of about N67.7 billion compared to N35.7 billion it contributed in the same period of last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost of the subsidiaries recorded a decline in their cost to income ratios, reflecting the impact of our effective cost management across the group including Guinea and South Africa, Botswana as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese three countries had their first three months of operations, hence the high cost operating ratio that you probably see in Guinea, South Africa and Botswana. But for all the others they have brought the costs down.\u201d\n\nWigwe noted that the transition into a holdings company was expected to play four key roles to deliver on the management objectives.\n\n\n\nCommenting on banks\u2019 expansions drive, the Vice President, Highcap Securities, Mr. David Adnori said banking with subsidiaries in Africa and Europe brings balance and improved corporate earnings, which he said was a win-win for shareholders and the economy where the banks have presence.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Says Nigerians tired of excuses, lamentations\n\n*We\u2019re not overwhelmed by Plateau killings, Lalong reassures\n\n*Blames crises on porous interstate borders\n\n*Terrorists have formed parallel govt, MBF laments\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nAs the country battles multiple security challenges, a frontline presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and National Leader of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, has promised that he will deliver a united and banditry-free Nigeria if elected president.\n\n\n\nThis is as the Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong has stated that his government was not overwhelmed by the recent mass killings in Kanam Local Government Area of the state in which over 100 lives were lost to attacks by the terrorists.\n\nBut the President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, has stated that terrorists have formed a parallel government in Nigeria, describing the country\u2019s security situation as that of a failed state.\n\n\n\nSpeaking yesterday at a grand rally by the youths under the aegis of Progressive Youth of South-West who declared their support for his presidential aspiration at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Onikan in Lagos, the former Lagos State governor stated that Nigerians are tired of excuses and lamentations of the past.\n\n\n\nThe youths from different states in the South-west, converged on Lagos in large numbers to drum up support for the aspiration of the national leader of the party.\n\nTinubu urged them to team up with him in his bid to change the story of Nigeria for the youths of today and tomorrow, which they represent.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAll you need is courage, determination and perseverance, if the YouTube alone has 2.9 billion people following it, including you all standing here, then Nigeria can excel, we can do it, you must develop the can-do-attitude, you must believe that this country is yours and you want to change the story. You must change the story of potential, the story of banditry, you must change the story of tribalism.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe as a nation can conveniently feed ourselves by being creative, visionary and committed, anybody who says we cannot, they can get out because it is voluntary. We cannot continue the lamentation of the past. We cannot continue with excuses of power failure, no nation made rapid development without electricity. Give us light and if we cannot be successful then you can abuse us, you cannot give us erratic light that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria, it is about time we have enough gas to fire up electricity and supply the rest of Europe and make money, long term from it. You know it. We don\u2019t want to bore you with it, when I started we used to pick dead bodies on the streets, but today Lagos is one of the cleanest, most progressive states in the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe urged the youths to revalidate their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards and be ready to vote in the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nIn his keynote address, Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who appreciated the grand support for Tinubu, noted that youths would continue to be identified as critical stakeholders, just as he enjoined all delegates to the APC primary to exercise their franchise wisely.\n\nThe South-west youth leaders at the event took their turns to speak on why they are promoting Tinubu to become the next president of Nigeria, come 2023.\n\n\n\nSpeaking, Dr Muritala Seriki, Dayo Israel, Muhammed Sulaiman, among others applauded the achievements of Tinubu in infrastructure, education, and raising the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of Lagos, while he was governor of the state, saying some of them were his products having brought them to the level they had attained presently.\n\nThis was just as they described the APC national leader as a detribalised Nigeria.\n\nWe are Not Overwhelmed by Plateau Killings, Lalong Reassures\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau State Governor, Lalong has stated that his government was not overwhelmed by the recent mass killings in the Kanam Local Government Area of the state in which over 100 lives were lost to attacks by the terrorists.\n\n\n\nLalong lamented that a planned military raid of the locations of the terrorists at the state borders may have been leaked to the terrorists who attacked the state a day earlier than the planned military operations.\n\nThe Plateau State governor, who was featured on ARISE NEWS Channel on Friday night, blamed the persistent attacks in the state on porous interstate borders, pointing out that the state government was not overwhelmed by the state of insecurity in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will not say I am overwhelmed because I have been working with the security agents. But for this reason (Kanam attacks), we may say we are overwhelmed, but not overwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said one of the challenges facing the state was the long stretch of borders it has with Kaduna, Taraba, and Bauchi, saying \u201cyou may work out measures to protect your border, but some people will enter from other states, especially if the states are not doing same.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said that was the reason the Northern Governors Forum (NGF) was working out a synergy \u201cso that as one state protects its borders, others do same, if not, just when you think you have done well, you will see an influx of bandits from other states.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that with the heavy military bombardments in the North-west, the terrorists are now looking for hideouts, and migrating towards states in the North-central, and vowed that Plateau will not harbour them.\n\nHe said he was not only worried about Plateau State, adding that as Chairman of NGF, but he was also worried about a region devastated by the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHe added that there must be some informants that leaked the planned military operations to terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe had started having meetings on synergy to prepare to secure our borders against the terrorists, but it was like someone leaked the information. This is because the military was planning a raid on the border areas, but before we carried out the raid, they were very fast and had attacked a day earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut some of these terrorists move like thieves \u2013 thieves won\u2019t inform you before they come. They come when they know you\u2019re not awake,\u201d Lalong lamented, adding that \u201cwhen our attention was on other places, they sneaked into where we had relative peace, caused havoc and ran away.\u201d\n\nThe governor also insinuated that the terrorists may have used mining activities in the area as a cover for their sinister motives.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are massive mineral deposits in the area; they may have pretended that they are there for mining activities and wreak havoc on the people. \u201cIncidentally, that\u2019s where we also planned our pilot scheme on ranching; all these may have been the attraction.\u201d\n\nHe said that at a recent meeting, he reminded the Council of State that the governors had enumerated certain challenges in addressing some of the security issues in some states that were identified as frontline states in the North.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr President had directed sometimes ago that we have a meeting with the security chiefs, which we did. But shortly after that, the then Chief of Army Staff died in an accident. After his death, it took a while to come back to the issues. So, at the Council of State, I had to ask what had happened to the measures that were being put in place,\u201d Lalong explained.\n\n\n\nHe said that as a followed-up to the issues he raised at the Council of State, President Muhammadu Buhari had called for a Security Council meeting. \u201cThis is particularly because it\u2019s now farming season, and farmers need to feel secure to go back to their farms,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe governor who was in Kanam five days after the attacks, said: \u201cI drove there immediately\u201d to commiserate with the people, and to show them that the state cared much for them.\n\n\n\nPriding himself as one that has brought a measure of peace to the state in the last two decades, Lalong said he has done much in this regard. He said that on the assumption of office, he had set up an inter-religion council, established Plateau Peace Agency, mediated between Fulani and Berom, and now mediating between the Fulani and Irigwe, all of which he said had paid off by the measure of peace that was witnessed in the state before the recent attacks. He added that it\u2019s no longer the issue of farmers and herders crisis, but terrorist attacks.\n\n\n\nHe said that the white papers from the various commissions set up to address crises in the state revealed that injustice and unfairness were a major cause of the crisis, which he said has largely been addressed, and has nothing to do with the current attacks by terrorists.\n\n\n\nIn another development, the President of MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu stated that terrorists have formed parallel government in the country and described Nigeria\u2019s security situation as that of a failed state.\n\n\u201cWe have a parallel government out there that seems to do what it feels like, while the constituted government seems to be incapacitated. So terrorists continue to do what they want to do and get away with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, Pogu said: \u201cConfidently I can tell you that these people are not more powerful than our military, but political forces are stopping our military from doing what are supposed to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has gone beyond the acceptable level. The unfortunate thing is that this government, because of its attitude, has pushed people into hating Fulani, because everybody now thinks Fulani are a nuisance; a people that will come and kill others in their sleep for whatever reason. But we can say that it is for displacement and taking over of ancestral lands and to change democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, this thing has to stop, because if, and when it gets to a level, the innocent Fulani who may not be part of these whole attacks will pay for it. How many Fulani are there across this country; if their attack is triggered from somewhere, it will spread like wildfire and they will be wiped out. So, this government has to change its attitude and deal with these criminals, otherwise, we are heading in that direction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Julian Owusu\u2019s journey from football to fintech",
          "text": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me as a footballer anymore. I\u2019m no longer defined by the game. This, along with the fact that I can build products that real people are using, is a true mark of success.\u201d\n\nAt 14, UK-born Ghanaian Julian Owusu discovered a talent that would earn him money: playing football.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream many young boys have, to gain global recognition and wealth doing something they enjoy, a sport watched by over 1.1 billion people across the world. While football might not be one of the top 20 paying professions in the world, it is the fifth-highest paid sports profession, with pro players getting an average of $3.6 million yearly.\n\nEven though football held a promising future for Julian, it was only one of his dreams. \u201cI grew up playing football,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in tech, even long before I started playing professionally.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his football career, Julian knew he wanted to tell a different story with his journey. \u201cMost of the other footballers I know have the same story, whether they were rich or poor. They don\u2019t know what else to do when they\u2019re not practising or playing. They don\u2019t know where or if they belong outside the field. I wanted to be different.\u201d\n\nHe started his professional journey at 16 when he joined Eleven Wise\u2014a Division One football league club based in Ghana\u2014as a striker. Julian had joined the club on the recommendation of his agent who thought he would benefit from the club\u2019s rigorous training. \u201cIt was actually my first solo trip to Ghana,\u201d he says. \u201cMy folks had brought me over every year, but coming down to join Eleven Wise was the first time I\u2019d be in Ghana on my own. And I think that trip is really what helped me build my entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d\n\nHe had to forget his UK background and immerse himself in Ghana\u2019s culture. \u201cI had to understand local cultures and become like my teammates. I had to understand what the fans wanted, and what my coaches wanted. So I learned a lot of lessons very quickly about becoming a professional and just having a professional mindset.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of his one-year contract with Eleven Wise, Julian moved to Berekum Chelsea, a premier league club out of Ghana, in 2010 where he helped the team score several goals including the 2010\u20132011 Ghana Premier League cup\u2014the youngest team ever to win the cup\u2014the MTN FA Cup, and the 2011 Ghana\u2019s President\u2019s Cup.\n\nFrom Berekum Chelsea, he glided through other clubs, from Hayes and Yeading United, to Burnham, right until 2014 when he decided to retire.\n\nWhen football players on defining paths, such as Julian, retire, it\u2019s often because of injury. Like in most contact sports, football players are exposed to more than their fair share of harm including muscle sprains and toe fractures.\n\nJulian\u2019s retirement, however, had nothing to do with injury, age, or scandal. He simply wanted to be more.\n\n\u201cI was on holiday one year, writing and thinking through what I wanted to become,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wondered what I wanted to be when I was in my 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s, and I realised that football wasn\u2019t the only thing I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe needed to build knowledge in an industry that could set him up for success, and so he decided to return to school, a transition he didn\u2019t find so difficult, he says. \u201cIt was difficult at the beginning, but all the skills I\u2019d learnt playing football were transferrable. I knew how to work hard. The only reason it was difficult at the start wasn\u2019t because I was studying. It was more because I wasn\u2019t training or going to play a match.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, enrolled at the London School of Business and Management, Julian got introduced to digital product management by executing the website for the New Student Union. But he didn\u2019t fall in love with the field until 2 years later when he landed a product management role at Landon and Fitch, a London-based advertising firm. \u201cIn my first role, I was only managing the teams and scope, and I wanted more. At Landon and Fitch, though, I got hands-on experience with building and ideating, and that\u2019s where everything clicked into place and I knew it was what I would continue doing. There\u2019s something beautiful about the process of taking something from an idea, bringing it to life and seeing real people use it.\u201d\n\nFrom his product management role at Landor & Fitch in 2018, Julian went on to manage other products at Culturetool and Spark44, right until he decided to build a product of his own: Zuberi Pay.\n\nThe idea for Zuberi came to Julian as he drove through the streets of London. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of building a fintech. I just wanted to tackle a problem every day people had. And when I thought about what problems 90% of people had, it was cash flow, money!\u201d\n\nWhile the product was officially released for beta-testing in January 2021, Zuberi started operation right around the time COVID went mainstream in February 2020. Julian added 10 workers to a WhatsApp group and explained his idea to them: Zuberi would provide them with salary advances, for a small interest fee.\n\nZuberi\u2019s app interface\n\nWithin a few months, the number of people who\u2019d joined the group doubled. He was providing 30 people with advances, using everyday tools like WhatsApp for communication, Excel for data collection, and Taptap Send to transfer payment. \u201cWhen I thought about how much I was doing just on WhatsApp and Excel, I realised that I could learn more and expand better with an app. So I started pitching to investors.\u201d\n\nMonths later, he\u2019d raised about \u00a322,000 ($28,700) from friends and family to build the first iteration of the Zuberi App. At that time, he also brought on as co-founder Nana Adomako\u2014who worked as the Growth Manager for Taptap Send.\n\nBy December 2021, Julian quit his 9\u20135 as a product manager and moved to Ghana to focus on and lead the vision of Zuberi. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a founder of a startup,\u201d he says, \u201cI think the best role is probably to be a product manager because you\u2019re basically the CEO of the product and you get to know the ins and outs of what you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWhile Zuberi is still in its early stages and available to only a select group of users, it has thousands of Ghanaians on its waitlist. \u201cWe are still sorting out regulation and yet to fully launch. We\u2019re working with the Bank of Ghana to get Zuberi up as soon as possible so people can access its benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his fears, Julian says he has none, even though he\u2019s earning significantly less as a CEO, compared to when he was a footballer or a product manager. \u201cI think I could probably play again if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve found my calling. Here, I\u2019m building value, actual value I can see in people\u2019s lives. I might not be earning as much but I\u2019m not high-maintenance. As long as I can provide for my family, then that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "In the wake of explosive accusations against Africa\u2019s most valuable startup, Flutterwave co-founder speaks",
          "text": "Former CEO of Africa\u2019s most valuable startup Flutterwave, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, has responded to the recent allegations of fraud and insider trading levelled against the company\u2019s management and current CEO and co-founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nThe accusations were laid out in an article by David Hundeyin, and a Medium post by Clara Wanjiku.\n\nWhile both Wanjiku and Hundeyin\u2019s articles raised important questions about the culture, ethics, and governance at Flutterwave, Aboyeji claims no privileged insight into the company after his time there. He however addressed concerns raised about things that happened while he was CEO of the payment giant.\n\nOne of the many actions Agboola was accused of was creating a ghost \u201cco-founder\u201d identity, who went by the name Greg, to give himself more shares, in the company\u2019s early days. To this, Aboyeji told TechCabal that the agreement between the co-founders was that Agboola would hold some shares in trust for the fictitious Greg.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the company, I was told there\u2019s a chief technology officer named Greg, who\u2019s from MIT, whom I\u2019d meet someday. It never happened,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cAfter a while, it became clear what had happened. By that time it didn\u2019t matter. We [Aboyeji and third co-founder Adeleke Adekoya] had already signed agreements, and I decided to just move on.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, on Wednesday, April 13, Aboyeji had put out a series of tweets, aimed at distancing himself from any involvement in the allegations levelled at Agboola and Flutterwave. He said, in one of them, that some of the allegations made could prevent him from being a company director, and thus affect his livelihood.\n\nHe also said that Hundeyin, the article\u2019s author, didn\u2019t reach out to him for comment.\n\nThe article alleged that Agboola did not resign from his job as Head of Digital Factory and Innovation at Access Bank before working at Flutterwave. It said Aboyeji had been a co-conspirator who had testified, alongside Agboola and Access Bank CEO Herbert Wigwe, before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under oath, that Agboola never worked simultaneously at Flutterwave and Access Bank.\n\nAboyeji\u2019s time as CEO\n\nLaunched in 2016 as a Nigerian and US-based payments company, with offices in Lagos and San Francisco, Flutterwave was co-founded by Agboola, Adekoya, and Aboyeji, who had earlier co-founded Andela. TechCabal obtained a copy of Flutterwave\u2019s US certificate of incorporation, prepared by Aboyeji on May 2, 2016.\n\nFlutterwave started when Aboyeji met the other co-founders Agboola and Adekoya while still at Andela.\n\nAccess Bank had hired an engineer from Andela to work on a product that later turned out to be PayWithCapture, a mobile payment solution that permitted customers to make payments by scanning a merchant\u2019s pre-generated QR code using their phone cameras.\n\nAfter a series of conversations about the African payment landscape, Aboyeji, Agboola, and Adekoya teamed up to start Flutterwave, to solve the challenges with African payment. Agboola and Adekoya had the ideas; Aboyeji came on board to execute.\n\nIn the early days of Flutterwave, the co-founders were still working at their previous jobs. Aboyeji explained that although the trio had agreed to a transition timeline towards working on Flutterwave full-time, there were challenges with adhering to that timeline. Flutterwave investors were made aware that Agboola and Adekoya had transitioned from working for the bank to consulting for the Africa Fintech Foundry through an investor update.\n\n\u201cMy co-founders informed me that they\u2019ve resigned from Access Bank, but they had to give some notice to the bank, and since they were handling sensitive positions at Access Bank, what ended up happening was they became consultants to Africa Fintech Foundry,\u201d Aboyeji said. Africa Fintech Foundry is an initiative by Access Bank that nurtures and accelerates the growth of fintech startups in Africa.\n\nAboyeji described the relationship between Access Bank and Flutterwave as a mutually beneficial one. Access Bank was the budding fintech\u2019s banking partner and Flutterwave helped introduce the bank to its Silicon Valley network.\n\nHe also disclosed that, early on, when the company started, there were ongoing conversations with Access Bank to invest in Flutterwave, but due to Nigerian banking regulations that prohibited banks from getting involved in non-banking activities, the deal couldn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of Flutterwave was as a result of the collaboration between a bank and the local tech ecosystem. I think that\u2019s an incredible learning opportunity,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to Access Bank to comment on their relationship with Flutterwave\u2019s founders but hasn\u2019t gotten a response as of press time.\n\nSEC investigation\n\nIn an investor update obtained by TechCabal, covering Flutterwave\u2019s activities from May 2016 to June 2017, Flutterwave\u2019s investors were informed that the SEC had opened an investigation into the company and its investors.\n\nAs seen in a legal brief by Orrick, a US law firm, Flutterwave had 85 investors, and there was concern that some of them were not qualified to be investors under US law.\n\n\u201cTo invest in a startup in the US, you have to be a US resident, an international investor who can claim to be a Reg S investor or a close family, friend, or employee of founders,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cThe SEC were concerned about whether we had followed the right process in making sure the investors were accredited. We proved that every investor was profiled and qualified under the required exemptions.\u201d\n\nAfter the SEC\u2019s initial enquiries, further investigation on Flutterwave, as related to this matter was closed, according to a letter from the SEC dated September 28, 2017. There was no other investigation made by the SEC outside of this incident during his tenure as CEO, according to Aboyeji.\n\nChange of name\n\nAfter the initial fictitious Greg co-founder incident, there were accusations of instances where Agboola often changed his first name to Greg when communicating with external parties.\n\nAboyeji acknowledged being aware of this happening on a few occasions, stating that it sometimes happened when Agboola, who was already well known as an Access Bank employee\u2014but now with Flutterwave\u2014needed to engage with other banks.\n\n\u201cThat was the context to which I understood him using Greg. Otherwise, as a result of the hostility among banks, other banks can just say, \u2018You\u2019re from Access Bank, we will not use you.\u2019 While we\u2019re not Access Bank. We\u2019re Flutterwave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nExiting Flutterwave\n\nIn October 2018, when the news broke out that Aboyeji was stepping down from his role as Flutterwave CEO, there were rumours that all wasn\u2019t well, and that he had been fired. Aboyeji explained to TechCabal that his departure was due to differing opinions with Agboola on how the company should be run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. GB [Agboola] and I started butting heads,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cHe wanted input on things that I felt were my responsibilities, and he didn\u2019t want input on things he felt were his responsibilities. And I said there can\u2019t be two captains of this ship.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September 2018, during a board meeting, Aboyeji stated that he wanted to leave the company and suggested that Agboola, who was then Chief Product Officer, be brought in as a product-focused CEO.\n\nAboyeji offered to leave Flutterwave within 6 months, to allow for a smooth transition. But the board said that there was no need for that, suggesting he could hand over immediately.\n\n\u201cI thought it was rather sudden, but I agreed because I already wanted to leave,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nAfter a few weeks of negotiating the terms of his exit, on October 12, 2018, Aboyeji sent an email announcing his decision to resign as CEO and board member at Flutterwave. A copy of this email was shared with TechCabal.\n\nAboyeji maintains that his exit followed due process and that he currently doesn\u2019t own a stake in the company; he also insists he wasn\u2019t forced to sell his shares at a lower price.\n\n\u201cHow can someone force me to do that? I didn\u2019t sell my shares to GB [Agboola]. I sold my shares to a third party. I fully exited Flutterwave at the $1 billion valuation round last year.\u201d\n\nAboyeji also shared his thoughts on past Flutterwave employee Clara Wanjiku\u2019s recent account of Flutterwave neglecting to remove her as the contact person on their M-Pesa account, resulting in the police hounding Wanjiku and her family after the account recorded a fraudulent transaction.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think it was intentional. Based on his experience, the company\u2019s negligence was due to not having a process to properly off-board employees when they leave.\n\n\u201cI kept getting Flutterwave bank alerts for over a year after I left,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cI\u2019ve run into trouble with the authorities because Flutterwave still had me listed as a point of contact, long after I left.\u201d\n\nThese allegations come 2 months after Flutterwave raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion in just 12 months.\n\nCommenting on the allegations raised in Hundeyin\u2019s article, Flutterwave shared this response with TechCabal:\n\n\u201cThe blog post in question is based on recycled and previously addressed claims, and several others that are false. As part of our commitment to operating an ethically responsible company in compliance with all applicable laws, we take all claims of this nature seriously, and are conducting a thorough review. We will take action as and when appropriate. This enables us to maintain the highest workplace standards and remain focused on our mission to create financial possibilities for companies and consumers across Africa.\u201d\n\nLed by Agboola, Flutterwave has grown to become a beacon of success in the African tech ecosystem, with Agboola seen as not just a successful entrepreneur but a notable investor in the African startup space.\n\nIn its last fundraising announcement in February, the company revealed that 900,000 businesses globally use Flutterwave to process payments, in 150 currencies, up from 290,000 businesses, as at March 2021. This threefold increase means that the African payment giant has now processed 140 million transactions worth more than $9 billion since its inception.\n\nUpdates: Flutterwave\u2019s response to the allegations were added to this story by 11:00 PM GMT+1 on April 16, 2022\n\n\n\nFlutterwave is an advertiser with and sponsor of several TechCabal properties. Future Africa, which Iyin Aboyeji leads, and Gbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, are investors in Big Cabal Media, parent company of TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Yeah, I still care.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWho will take the poison pill?\n\nTwitter\u2019s Edit button\n\nSafaricom\u2019s online SIM card registration portal\n\nRise.ng\u2019s $150K pre-seed\n\nThis year, Techpoint Africa is organising the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, where you can learn the basics of Web3 and discover how to build a career in Web3 and blockchain.\n\nThe Blockchain Summit will be held on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos.

Well, I\u2019m here to give you the lowdown because it doesn\u2019t appear to be ending anytime soon. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nIt all started when Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, announced the purchase of a 9.1% stake in Twitter on April 4, 2022. That news sent the company\u2019s stock price soaring.\n\nWhat prompted his purchase? Musk publicly questioned Twitter\u2019s approach to free speech via a poll conducted on his Twitter account on March 25, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing that, Twitter announced Musk would join its board of directors. In a tweet, Musk stated that he intends to collaborate with Twitter\u2019s CEO and board \u201cto make significant improvements to Twitter in the coming months!\u201d\n\nMusk, however, declined the offer to join the board of directors after initially responding in the affirmative. Consequently, he updated his Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing after declining a seat on Twitter\u2019s board to indicate that he would not be a passive player in the company\u2019s affairs.\n\nHe claims that his bid to buy Twitter is \u201cbest and final\u201d and that to make the necessary changes \u2013 an edit feature, an open-source algorithm, less moderation, and a higher threshold for removing offensive tweets \u2013 Twitter must go private.\n\nWhat did Twitter say? Twitter, on the other hand, regarded Elon Musk\u2019s offer to take over the company as unwelcome. Consequently, Twitter is reportedly employing the poison pill strategy, making it more difficult for Musk to acquire a significant stake in the company and avoid a hostile takeover.\n\nWhat does this mean? If the Tesla CEO wants to buy Twitter, he\u2019ll have to increase his $43 billion bid.\n\nIs the poison pill strategy similar? Yes, it is. Recall that in 2012, Carl Icahn, an American business mogul, became a major investor in Netflix after purchasing a nearly 10% stake.\n\nIcahn informed Bloomberg that Netflix was a good candidate to sell its business to another company like Amazon or Google. In response, Netflix\u2019s board of directors implemented the poison pill strategy.\n\nGiven Musk\u2019s estimated net worth of $259 billion, it\u2019s unclear how much capital he has at his disposal. Nonetheless, he stated in a Thursday interview that he could \u201ctechnically afford\u201d to buy Twitter outright for the price he proposed.\n\nYet, he admitted that he is \u201cnot sure\u201d his takeover bid for Twitter will be successful. He also said that if his offer for Twitter is rejected, he has a \u201cPlan B\u201d but provided no further details.\n\nDo you see why I said this drama doesn\u2019t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon? Can he, however, afford Twitter with this poison pill strategy? And what do you think his backup plan is?\n\nThe Twitter Edit button may keep a record of previous tweets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter announced it was working on an edit button on April 1, 2022 \u2014 April Fool\u2019s Day. Many of us probably thought it was a joke, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not.\n\nWhy? Reverse Engineers, Nima Owji and Alessandro Pelluzi, confirmed this here and here, respectively.\n\nThey both discovered that after writing and publishing a tweet, you can click on the three dots above the post on the web and select \u201cEdit tweet.\u201d However, for now, you can only edit the entire post, but you can\u2019t change what\u2019s already there.\n\nWhat does that even mean? Jane Manchun Wong, another reverse engineer, explains in a tweet that the edit function appears to have an \u201cimmutable\u201d quality, which means that when a tweet is edited, Twitter may create an entirely new tweet while preserving previous versions of that tweet.\n\nTo confirm this, Owji claims that users will not be able to change the audience of a tweet after it has been edited.\n\nHowever, Twitter has not confirmed the existence of a tweet history tracker.\n\nIs this feature available to all users? No, it\u2019s not. The feature will only be available to Twitter Blue subscribers.\n\nCurrently, Twitter has begun implementing the edit button on the web version, and none of the reverse engineers mentioned this feature for iOS or Android devices.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon. Get it directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Intelligence by Techpoint newsletter here.\n\nSafaricom\u2019s online SIM card registration portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s telco operators, has provided an option for its customers to register their SIM cards online following the new SIM card registration deadline extension from April 15, 2022, to October 15, 2022.\n\n\u201cAfrican governments are all the same,\u201d Ogheneruemu said when she saw the news. Well, who am I to argue?\n\nRemember that Mrs Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, Ghana\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digitalisation, extended the deadline for re-registering SIM cards \u2014 an exercise, which began on October 1, 2021 and was scheduled to conclude on March 31, 2022 \u2013 to July 31, 2022.\n\nWhy is Safaricom introducing the portal, though? Well, subscribers vented on social media, urging the company to follow in the footsteps of Telkom and Airtel Kenya, which had already implemented online SIM card registration.\n\nWhat does this imply for its customers? It reduces the stress of waiting at telco offices for several days while trying to meet the deadline. Consequently, customers will be able to fill out their information on the new portal without having to visit the stores.\n\nAlso, customers need their smartphones to update their SIM card information and upload their passport photographs to the system.\n\nAs of September 2021, the penetration levels of feature phones and smartphones were reportedly 67.9% and 53.4%, respectively, implying that half the Kenyan own a smartphone.\n\nSo, how do you register? After clicking this link, enter your phone number to receive an SMS with a one-time passcode. Upload both the front and back of your ID, and then press the \u201cSend\u201d button.\n\nIs that all? Yes! After completing this process, you will be notified that your registration was successful.\n\nRise.ng\u2019s $150K pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRise.ng, a Nigerian startup, has secured a $150,000 pre-seed round as it prepares to launch its business operations in the country.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Olawunmi Oyedeji, the startup was inspired by \u2018Try My Job\u2019 \u2014 a reality TV show where influential people swap jobs with their fans for a day and SMEs are given a platform to showcase their products and services.\n\nThe startup claims it takes advantage of this to provide the best selection of artisans and vendors for anyone\u2019s day-to-day needs.\n\nEssentially, it provides artisans/vendors who use its platform with access to a dashboard that allows them to advertise and promote their services or products with a safe finance setup that makes their payment seamless and secure. In turn, the customer benefits from working with a vendor/artisan who has been verified and has insurance cover in case of an unforeseen event.\n\nAccording to the company, it plans to revolutionise service delivery by focusing on low-income earners, specifically artisans and vendors who lack access to digital/online visibility. This will help it grow its customer base as it claims to be the starting search point for such services.\n\nEverything in African tech last week\n\nCan embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAnalysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAn insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nHow Microsoft\u2019s Adora Nwodo is living the software engineering dream she had as a 6-year-old\n\nHere\u2019s the low-down on all that happened at April\u2019s Pitch Friday\n\nMTN receives final PSB approval to kick-start an exciting era for Nigerian fintech\n\nThe science behind NFTs: How viral coffin dance meme sold for over $1m\n\nDon\u2019t wait for ASUU; here are 7 marketable skills you can learn in 30 days\n\nWeb3: Engineering tomorrow\u2019s Internet at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

Although eventful, it has been overwhelming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), I knew the first few days would be that way. But, it hasn\u2019t been easy! And honestly, I\u2019ve been looking forward to today.\n\nSo, aside from the fact that it\u2019s Good Friday, I must say that it will be a good one for me because I\u2019ll get plenty of rest and possibly watch some Netflix and chill.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m available for enjoyment this weekend!

To register, please, click here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDriving financial inclusion with embedded finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, I wanted to get a phone for someone, so I decided to go to a store \u2014 after comparing prices on Jumia and CDcare.\n\nHowever, when I got there, I discovered the phone was more expensive than I had anticipated, and for the first ten minutes, I was blank. I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria? Click on the link to find out.\n\nUber Tanzania suspends operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Thursday, April 14, 2022, ride-hailing company, Uber, suspended operations in Tanzania until further notice after six years in the country.\n\nUber announced the decision in a statement sent to customers across the country, noting that they will not operate in Tanzania until an agreement with the authorities is reached.\n\nWhy the suspension? Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services. However, considering financial inclusion can be achieved in other ways besides using a bank account, this may not be an accurate representation of financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy integrating financial services into non-financial solutions, more Nigerians can be integrated into the financial system without requiring a bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Thus, many experts are excited about the inclusion of telcos in financial services in Nigeria.\n\nAfter more than four years of initiating talks, the CBN announced last Monday that it had approved the licence application of MTN. The apex bank had already issued three PSB licences in 2021 to 9Mobile, Globacom, and Unified Payments. Among the telcos, only 9Mobile is operating with its licence as 9PSB.\n\nAirtel is yet to receive a final licence approval, although it got the Approval-in-Principle (AIP) alongside MTN last year. MTN, however, had a head start as it got a Super Agent licence in 2019, which allowed it to build the largest mobile agent network in Nigeria. It currently has over 770,000 agents in the country.\n\nAirtel, on the other hand, only got its Super Agent licence in November 2021, less than two months after the AIP. Hence, the second-largest telecom operator may still be preoccupied with building out a robust agent network to ease the deployment of its Airtel Pay service once it is approved by the CBN.\n\nKalu Aja, a personal finance expert, says the new MTN licence means more revenue for the telco, more productivity for users, more revenue for Federal Inland Revenue Service, more jobs, and more competition for banks.\n\nThe PSB licence enables Africa\u2019s largest mobile network operator, MTN, to accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nPSBs are also expected to have not less than 50 percent physical access points in rural areas. In essence, the CBN expects MTN and other PSBs to have significant ground operations in rural communities where the burden of financial inclusion is most acute.\n\nThe MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) comes with all the features. MoMo is described as a secure electronic service that enables MTN Mobile Money wallet holders to store funds, send and receive money, make payments and do a number of other transactions simply using their mobile phone.\n\n\u201cThinking about MoMo in rural areas and payments for agricultural produce through it,\u201d said Sakwe Njioh, CEO of Morari, an agritech that supplies fresh produce from vetted farms. \u201cThis will be lit as more than 80 percent of food vendors and farmers don\u2019t have accounts.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA), 38.1 million of Nigeria\u2019s 106 million (18 years and above) adults or 36 percent of Nigerians remain completely financially excluded.\n\nThe CBN set a target of 95 percent financial inclusion by 2024. While millions of people own a bank account, they are unable to access other banking services. For example, less than five percent of the adult population have a pension or insurance cover.\n\nFinancial inclusion in Nigeria has become a shifting target for the authorities as efforts to include millions of people have yielded very little results. In 2012, the CBN pledged to reduce the number of people without access to financial services from 46.3 percent in 2010 to 20 percent by 2020. Hence, the number of Nigerians included in the formal sector was expected to increase from 36.3 percent in 2010 to 70 percent by 2020.\n\nTo achieve the goal, the apex bank chose a bank-led financial inclusion, which meant that banks were the major drivers of financial inclusion in the country. However, traditional banks have not been able to reach rural people due to several reasons such as the high cost of operating bank branches, onerous and bureaucratic onboarding procedures, and lack of identity documents to open bank accounts.\n\nThe CBN, in an attempt to remedy the situation, initiated the agent banking network alongside the banks in 2018. The financial regulator also adopted mobile money and gave financial institutions a blank cheque to operate in the space.\n\nThe GSMA noted in a report that the mobile money licensing framework restricted mobile network operators from delivering financial services directly, instead they were only able to provide their infrastructure to third-party financial services providers, limiting both incentive and impact.\n\nThe PSB model the CBN also unveiled in 2018 was copied heavily from India\u2019s Payment Banks model. Like Nigeria, the Indian model restricts lending (either directly or in partnership), underwriting insurance, or dealing in foreign exchange, except to swap international remittances in foreign currencies to the local currency.\n\nRead also: How embedded finance can drive Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion\n\n\u201cWith the restrictions on product offerings, it is possible that PSBs in Nigeria will face the same challenges as PBs did in India,\u201d GSMA said. \u201cOf the 11 PBs that were granted licences in principle in India in 2015, only six have survived and three are now profitable after approximately three years in operation.\u201d\n\nBut the suitability of telcos to tackle financial inclusion is not in doubt. The majority of Nigerians who are unbanked live in rural areas. They are also mostly young people and women, and the northern region accounts for the most population, as well as people with low literacy.\n\nThe GSMA, however, noted that 61 percent of unbanked people have a mobile phone, which is an indication of the enormous potential of reaching underbanked segments through mobile financial inclusion.\n\nVictor Asemota, growth partner at AnD who has worked on several MTN projects, believes the licence is first beneficial to MTN as a telecom operator.\n\n\u201cMTN will make your PSB account ground zero for selling all of its services and more. It will also need it to pay others who work for them and distribute for them. The biggest headache we had with VTU at some point was helping with reconciliation reports. It was a nightmare,\u201d he said.\n\nHe sees MTN unifying transactions using its platform. During the unveiling of the telco\u2019s new logo, Adia Sowho, chief marketing officer, said MTN was exploring collaboration with an open API that could be accessed by innovators, including fintech companies and other financial services players.\n\nThe telco has already secured different partnerships with fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nBut for Adewale Adetugbo, a telecoms expert, MTN\u2019s success in financial inclusion depends on how it is able to convince the unbanked to use MoMo instead of what they are already used to.\n\n\u201cApart from MTN being \u2018big\u2019, why would Iya Modina use them instead of what she uses today? What can MTN do that others can\u2019t?\u201d Adetugbo asked.\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, CEO of TeamApt, also doesn\u2019t see fintech companies losing ground to MTN in the long run.",

          "text": "Since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced the final approval of MTN\u2019s Payment Service Bank (PSB) licence application, many have tried to define the role the telecommunication company will play in the financial services industry in Nigeria.\n\nMTN\u2019s fintech business is known as MoMo, short for \u2018mobile money\u2019. Hence, the conversation has been that the PSB licence enables MTN to become a mobile money operator.\n\nHowever, a PSB is not entirely a mobile money operator. In fact, the CBN has a guideline for mobile money, separate from the one it issued for payment service banks.\n\n\u201cNo matter how they try, and although MoMo means mobile money, MTN\u2019s MoMo is still a payment services bank and not a mobile money operator. But considering everyone is conflating both, they are surely on to something,\u201d said Edmund Olotu, founder and CEO of TechAdvance.\n\nDefining mobile money\n\nThe International Monetary Fund defines mobile money as a pay-as-you-go digital medium of exchange and store of value using mobile money accounts, facilitated by a network of mobile money agents. It is a financial service offered to its clients by a mobile network operator or another entity that partners with mobile network operators, independent of the traditional banking network.\n\nIn 2019, there were 15.3 million mobile money customers in Nigeria, according to Statista. Compared to previous years, the number of users increased significantly. Nigeria, however, still lags its peers in West Africa in the growth of mobile money, according to Ericsson\u2019s Consumer and Market Insight report, titled \u2018Mobile Financial Services on the Rise\u2019.\n\nThe report found that Nigeria made progress from the 3 percent mobile money adoption rate in 2015, its 30 percent in 2021 lags Ghana\u2019s 90 percent, Angola\u2019s 47 percent, Ivory Coast\u2019s 79 percent, and Senegal\u2019s 75 percent, as gathered from the latest Ericsson.\n\nA bank account is not required to use mobile money services \u2014 the only prerequisite is a basic mobile phone. In many countries, phone numbers are used in the place of bank accounts for mobile money.\n\nThe MTN Mobile Money, for example, stores funds in a secure electronic account linked to an MTN mobile phone number.\n\nWhile licensed operators can use phone numbers to receive and send money, the phone numbers must be linked to a bank account where the money eventually resides.\n\nRead also: Mobile money transaction growth in 3 charts\n\nIn fact, there are only three scenarios in which mobile money can take place including a bank account (savings, current, and domiciliary accounts), a card account (credit, debit, and pre-paid), and a stored value (e-wallet: reloaded stored value account and pre-paid account).\n\nMobile money operators offering savings wallet services are only allowed to operate a Savings Wallet Principal Pool Account and a Savings Wallet Interest Pool Account in a settlement bank with the funds having the protection of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation under the pass-through insurance.\n\nWhat is a PSB?\n\nIndia first introduced the payment bank model in 2013 as a measure to tackle over 40 percent financial exclusion growth.\n\nThe initiative has helped to accelerate financial inclusion. According to the World Bank\u2019s Global Financial Inclusion database or Global Findex Report (2017), 80 percent of the Indian adult population have a bank account as of 2017, up from the 53 percent in 2014.\n\nThe Guideline for Payment Service Bank (PSB) released by the CBN in 2018 was heavily influenced by the Indian Guideline for Payment Banks. In 2021, the CBN released a supervisory framework for payment service banks to streamline their operations and deepen financial inclusion.\n\nThe apex bank defines a PSB as a type of bank that operates on a smaller scale by harnessing technology services via mobile and agency banking to mobilise deposits and facilitate transfers from unbanked customers in rural areas and any location where they exist in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN mandates, among other things, PSB operators to deploy at least 25 percent of their services to rural areas to be defined by the regulatory body from time to time and other underbanked areas. PSBs will also need to deploy automated teller machines and point-of-sale (PoS) centres to the areas.\n\nThe apex bank, however, banned PSBs from granting loans or advances or guarantees, accepting deposits in foreign currencies, underwriting risks, establishing a subsidiary, except as prescribed in the CBN Regulation on the Scope of Banking and Ancillary Matters.\n\nMobile money vs PSBs\n\nSome experts say the difference between the two concepts is very subtle.\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, co-founder and CEO of TeamApt, says what separates the two is that while mobile money services need a deposit money bank as a settlement bank, a PSB is allowed to deal with the central bank directly.\n\n\u201cA PSB is like a retail bank, except it doesn\u2019t give loans. A super agent initiates transactions to and from your third-party bank account. Mobile money initiates transactions to and from your mobile money wallet with them,\u201d said Olotu.\n\nPSBs have more in common with mobile money services. For instance, mobile money depends on wallets; most banks are prioritising mobile wallets. MoMo is also a secure electronic service that enables MTN Mobile Money wallet holders to store funds, send and receive money, make payments and do a number of other transactions simply using their mobile phone.\n\nBoth mobile money services and PSBs use banking agents or PoS terminal operators. MTN currently has the largest agent network in Nigeria, with about 770,000 agents across the country. It is expected that the operator will be utilising this asset to push its payment services.",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, debited 10 banks N7.02 trillion in 2021 over failure to meet the 27.5 per cent Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) threshold\n\nAccording to audited financial statements of the banks, the apex bank had debited them a sum of N6.71trillion in 2020 for not meeting its monetary requirement.\n\nThe CRR is the minimum amount banks and merchant banks are expected to retain with the CBN from customer deposits and it carries no interest and is not available for use by the banks in their day-to-day operations.\n\nIn early 2020, the apex bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased CRR by five per cent from 22.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent over its intention to address monetary-induced inflation whilst retaining its 65 per cent Loan Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy.\n\nThe CBN by regulation forces banks to retain up to 27.5 per cent of their deposits in CRR requirement, meaning that the deposits are not accessed by the banks for loans and advances, ThisDay reported.\n\nThe policy, which started in 2019 has drawn criticisms from most of the banks and shareholders who have cited a drop in their profitas a major consequence.\n\nThe banks include: Access Bank Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank), United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, FCMB group and Sterling Bank Plc.\n\nThe others are; Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc, and Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nExtracts from 2021 audited accounts by THISDAY revealed that, Access Bank, followed by Zenith bank suffered the highest debits in 2021, among other 10 banks, while Sterling bank suffered the lowest debit.\n\nAccess bank and Zenith bank are the top two banks in terms of customer deposits.\n\nAccess Bank reported 12 per cent increase in restricted deposits with CBN in 2021 to N1.47trillion from N1.31trillion reported in 2020, while Zenith Bank reported a decline of 6.05 per cent to N1.25trillion CRR deposit with CBN as against N1.33trillion in 2020.\n\nGTBank, the banking subsidiary of Guaranty Trust Holding company reported N953 billion CRR debit with CBN, a decline of 5.5 per cent from N1.01trillion reported in 2020.\n\nThe Group in its 2021 audited results explained that, \u201cRestricted deposits with central banks comprises of restricted deposits with the central bank not available for use in the Group\u2019s day-to-day operations.\n\n\u201cThe GTBank Nigeria had restricted balances of N953,040,540,000 with the CBN as at 31 December 2021 (December 2020: N1,008,748,051,000). This balance is CBN cash reserve requirement. The cash reserve ratio represents a mandatory total Naira deposit which should be held with the Central Bank of Nigeria as a regulatory requirement.\u201d\n\nThe group in its 2021 investors/analysts\u2019 presentation noted that CRR closed at N952 3 billion in 2021 from N1 009 trillion in 2020, resulting in effective CRR ratio of 37 6per cent from 44 33per cent in 2020 (with Special Bills, CRR closed 59 7 per cent).\n\nHowever, UBA\u2019s suffered a debit of N915.15billion in 2021, a decline of 13 per cent from N1.05trillion reported in 2020.\n\nUnion Bank of Nigeria and Stanbic IBTC reported 28per cent and 22 per cent increase in deposits kept with the central bank as CRR in 2021, respectively.\n\nThe effect can be seen in both banks\u2019 profits reported in the year under review.\n\nFrom recording a mandatory deposit of N454.8billion with CBN in 2021 from N356.45billion in 2020, Union Bank of Nigeria reported 20 per cent decline in profit before tax to N20.69 billion in 2021 from N25.97 billion, as Stanbic IBTC reported 30.3per cent drop in profit before tax to N66 billion in 2021 from N94.72 billion when its CRR closed 2021 at N423.18billion in 2021 from N348.17billion reported in 2020.\n\nOther banks are, Fidelity Bank with N686.1billion CRR debit from CBN in 2021 as against N540.13billion in 2021; Wema Bank grew its CRR debit to N313.8billion in 2021 from N246.97billion in 2020; FCMB Group closed 2021 with N309.63billion CRR debit with CBN from N289.14billion in 2020 and Sterling Bank reported N243.87billion mandatory reserve deposits with CBN from N228.79billion in 2020.\n\nAnalysts at GTCO in its report titled, \u201cNigeria Macro-economic outlook for 2022,\u201d explained that the reason for the tight system liquidity is the CBN\u2019s discretionary CRR debits which posed a huge challenge to credit growth for most banks.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cA rough estimate of the industry\u2019s effective CRR position suggests that about 50per cent of total naira deposits are sterilised with the CBN as CRR and Special Bills.\n\n\u201cGoing into 2022, the general build-up to the 2023 Elections will very likely result in a system awash with liquidity. We believe that the apex bank will tighten the system from the second half of the year just as political campaigns start, to mop-up excess liquidity from the system.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is unlikely that the CBN will slow down on its discretional CRR debits, we expect more banks to approach the apex bank for the release of a portion of their \u2018excess\u2019 CRR to assist them in funding their transactions, payment of regulatory levies/fees, etc.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori said the apex bank is using CRR to control inflation, stressing that the introduction of CRR is a drastic monetary policy targeted at controlling money supply in the banking system.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIf CBN fails to maintain its CRR policy, so much money will flow into the market and further deprecates naira. Generally, the policy has not favoured banks because the fund is not yielding any interest and of no benefit to the productive sector.\n\n\u201cThese are funds banks lend to the real sector to drive business activities, finance working capital of productive sector and boost GDP but the CBN is holding it down.\n\n\u201cIt is not a good development for the nation\u2019s economy in general. However, CBN has its reasons and releasing these funds, it might result in hyperinflation, which can damage the nation\u2019s economy. It is like a double edge situation- if you don\u2019t do it, the economy is damaged and if you do it, the economy also struggles.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the only way CBN can cut CRR is when inflation dropped to a single-digit rate.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had at the end of 2020 MPC noted that: \u201cthe committee is confident that increasing the CRR at this time is fortuitous as it will help address monetary-induced inflation whilst retaining the benefits from the Bank\u2019s LDR policy, which has been successful in significantly increasing credit to the private sector as well as pushing market interest rates downwards.\n\n\u201cThe Committee further encouraged the Management of the banks to be more vigorous in its drive to improve access to credit through its pursuit of the Loan-to-deposit ratio policy as doing this would help, not only in creating job opportunities but also help in boosting output growth and in moderating prices.\u201d",

          "text": "Founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has restated that restructuring remained the only solution to the country\u2019s developmental problems and not another election.\n\nEvangelist Uko who said this in a statement at the weekend, noted that it was unfortunate that almost every political actor in the country had focused attention on winning elections in 2023, while neglecting the core issues about the country\u2019s survival and development.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018The Politicking and 2023 Elections, Uko said, \u201cThe country is presently agog with political activities and politicos and their agents are having a swirl time endlessly meeting, scheming and plotting for political power.\n\n\u201cSerious contenders, gambling aspirants, jokers, and outright spoilers, are all in the fray. Clich\u00e9s such as zoning, consensus and sellable candidate pop up now and again in our media space, as aspirants and their handlers try to manouevre for advantage over others. Power is the name of the game.\u201d\n\nHe regretted that, \u201cNobody cares anymore about the real issues plaguing the land: structural defects of the foundation carrying the edifice and great need to urgently reconstruct the polity and save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe unworking unitary system and the obtuse political, social and economic culture that emanated therefrom over time.\n\n\u201cEveryone seem interested only in the 2023 elections. Every clique argues their man will transform Nigeria into a first world nation in no time.\n\n\u201cOur people still find the truth, that even an extraterrestrial being from another planet cannot achieve much under this 1999 constitution unitary structure, offensive. They don\u2019t want to hear about the truth. They want power by all means.\n\n\u201cPresidential power is huge. If well used, could impact positively on the land. That\u2019s true though. When I marched twenty years ago for a President of Igbo extraction, the idea was to give everyone a sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nUko maintained that the current Nigerian structure is not working, and according to him, anyone who genuinely believes in the country should be interested in evolving a system that truly works.\n\n\u201cBut the truth remains that our structure isn\u2019t working. The core structural adjustments remain imperative and a necessity if Nigeria is to be great,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs the noise and frenzy of politicking rises to higher crescendo and half truths and outright lies dominate the air, it becomes necessary to remind ourselves that the 2023 elections truly presents a great opportunity to save and heal the land, a chance that would be bungled at a great price and consequence.\n\n\u201cStories about vice-presidential aspirants masquerading as Presidential hopefuls, is disappointing. Raising the hopes of a people only to dash same in time, is unfair.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the 2023 polls, Uko, however, noted that the quest for a president of Igbo extraction was justified, pointing out that the like of Peter Obi, former Anambra State governor; Anyim Pius Anyim, former senate president, among others, are good candidates.\n\nHe noted, regardless, that the quest by the Igbo should not take precedence over restructuring.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the whispers that ala Igbo would once again produce only a running mate, isn\u2019t inspiring one bit. There are good presidential materials from the East. It is not true that only vice-presidential materials could be found in the East. Obi and Anyim from the opposition party are good choices,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNgige and Ogbonnaya Onu from the ruling party are great Presidential materials as well. There are credible Eastern suitables in other parties as well. Igbo candidates who are willing to accept second fiddle position are only self centered and greedy.\n\n\u201cBut there are other issues plaguing the land though. Whereas the issues responsible for the loss of faith, lack of interest and restiveness in the East remain unaddressed from the root, sadly, the refusal of the authorities to altruistically seek resolution and closure, isn\u2019t helping the situation. Another issue largely undiscussed.\n\n\u201cAgain. Failure to aggressively mobilise the people towards mass registration (PVC revolution), for the elections, seem to suggest the leadership across-the-board are probably hiding something from us all.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high, the election ten months away could determine the future of the country, yet a huge segment of the potential voters remain uninterested. Sad.\u201d\n\nThe activist also called the attention of Nigerians to another group using the IYM acronym associated with the Igbo Youth Movement to pursue agendas contrary to the objectives of the movement.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in another development, it has come to our attention that the acronym IYM is suddenly being used by some other persons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor sake of clarity, we state that we do not know any other IYM.\n\n\u201cWe have no relationships whatsoever with any group that replaced \u201cMovement\u201d for \u201cMandate\u201d. The Igbo Youth Movement was built to stand in a classs of it\u2019s own through decades of sacrifice and consistency. We remain non partisan and apolitical. We respect other folks views and choices and expect same from others. 2023 election is critical. The tempo and style of the aspiration and mobilisation remain uninspiring though.\u201d",

          "text": "Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, will formally join the presidential race Tuesday, joining several other aspirants who have made their intentions known.\n\nNgige will declare in Alor, one of the seven communities comprising the Idemili South Local Government of Anambra State.\n\nHis media office stated on Sunday that the minister had been consulting stakeholders in his All Progressives Congress (APC) party as well as stalwarts of opposition political parties.\n\nIt added that Ngige gave his explanation for consulting opposition political parties when he addressed his supporters at Amansea, a border town with Enugu State after visiting Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.\n\nThe media office stated also that Ngige\u2019s standpoint was informed by his belief that his aspiration had a cross-party appeal.\n\n\u201cI visited Enugu State governor as part of my nationwide consultation. Even though he is in PDP, he is an Igbo man.\n\n\u201cHe is a very realistic, discerning person. Don\u2019t forget also that Enugu is the capital of the former Eastern Region. And you know that respect is reciprocal.\n\n\u201cOver the week, I also consulted some other Nigerians not allied to any political party. Therefore, I had to consult the Enugu State governor over my intention to contest and to seek his views too.\n\n\u201cHe told me to kick the ball into the net.\n\n\u201cSo this journey is not for APC members alone. Our brothers in PDP are easily agreed that I tower above some of the persons aspiring to the position in their party.\n\n\u201cI have no fear whatsoever. I am equal to the task. Even our brothers in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) will join us in the task ahead,\u2019\u2019 Ngige was quoted as saying.\n\nThe minister said also that his antecedents, stewardship as a civil servant, governor, senator and minister stood him apart.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in Anambra in 34 months, those who did eight years have not done them.\n\n\u201cI did 34 months during which I laid the foundation for the new Anambra. I didn\u2019t just lay the foundation; I also took the house beyond the lintel level.\n\n\u201cI built schools, returned schools to the missions, rescued Odumegwu Ojukwu University from the status of a glorified secondary school \u2013 built structures there and secured accreditation for 15 courses including Law and Medicine.\n\n\u201cI rehabilitated and upgraded our general hospitals, including Enugwu-Ukwu, Onitsha and Amaku in Awka and restructured the state\u2019s civil service and also introduced examination as basis for promotion.\n\n\u201cI built more than 500km of roads across all senatorial zones that are still standing today.\n\n\u201cI also inherited N42 billion debts when I assumed office. I didn\u2019t talk about it. I put my hands on the plough and started working and cleared arrears of pensions and salaries, among others,\u2019\u2019 Ngige was also quoted as saying.\n\nNgige added that he had an advantage of being part of this government and part of the 7th Senate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well equipped for the job,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\n\u201cI plan to re-engineer Nigeria the way I re-engineered Anambra. April 19 is the date. Let all roads lead to Alor where the matter will be laid to rest,\u2019\u2019 Ngige quipped",

          "text": "Chrisland School officials in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, have finally responded to the sex tape issue involving their kids.\n\nPreviously, a mother alleged that her 10-year-old daughter was raped while on a school trip to Dubai organized by the Lagos school.\n\nBetween March 10 and 13, 2022, students from a private school in Victoria Garden City were in the UAE to compete in the World School Games.\n\nHowever, the pupil\u2019s mother alleged in the now-viral video that graphic footage of the incident had been spread on social media platforms.\n\nThe state\u2019s education ministry had also issued a warning to the broader public that uploading such footage amounted to child pornography.\n\nAccording to Akin Fadeyi, a member of the Chrisland advisory board, the school did not do any rape or pregnancy tests on any of the students, as has been widely reported.\n\nIn the historic sex scandal, there was no rape, according to the statement.\n\nAccording to Fadeyi, 76 students were enlisted for the Dubai trip, with 71 of them adhering to the code of behavior.\n\nMale and female students were kept seven storeys apart in the hotel where they stayed, according to the board member.\n\nHe claimed that the remaining five students who disobeyed the regulations had been subjected to disciplinary action.\n\nRead full statement below:\n\nWe have followed up on reports making the rounds on certain developments bordering on the morals and ethics of some of the students under our care, who represented the school at the World School games, Dubai between 8 and 14 of March 2022.\n\nWhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\n\nHowever, after a comprehensive evaluation of the situation, we cannot help but express how scandalised and distressed we feel as mothers, fathers and instructors with a relationship that holds a direct bearing on the development of those involved.\n\nNonetheless, we took a critical view of the number of students who partook in this recent trip and who did the school proud in our quest to expand the horizons of our students holistically through global exposure, which takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements. Of the 76 children who represented Chrisland, 71 ensured an untainted adherence to our standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. Within these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and Boys on the 4th floor to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\nWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. This was also to caution our students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences.\n\nThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform our children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\nWhile we hasten to affirm that as an institution that is managing children from diverse backgrounds, we cannot lay claim to, or embark on any sense of self-righteousness in our approach, but we learn and evolve within the frames of best practices every single day.\n\nAs such, as we recognise that there will always be space for improvement, we are therefore irrevocably committed to re-evaluating our processes to reinforce child protection protocols, even as we shall leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the senses of esteem of the children involved are uncompromisingly preserved. We have activated child protection processes and shall be engaging the expertise of child psychologists to ensure we translate this incidence to benefit the children in our care.\n\nWe are therefore not going to give room to sentiments that adopt less empathy in terms of the effects of the present situation on our children. We implore all of us as stakeholders to work together as build-up partners, rather than pull-down enablers. For every comment we make in this delicate period, we should remember that those involved are children and as such, they deserve our very responsible management of this situation in order not to affect their mental health, as we seek to clear this temporary fog in the path of their growth. This is why irrespective of currently charged emotions, we need to endeavor to keep our heads in focus, while carrying the authorities along in manners that leave nothing hidden, especially as we had nothing to hide.\n\nWe are proud to reassure our stakeholders that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place on our watch. For emphasis, only a COVID post travel test was conducted on the returning delegation of our students, in compliance with COVID-19 travel protocols, at the Life Centre Medical Services on March 21, 2022 at School Hall, Opebi.\n\nThis was through the nose swab test as consistent with COVID-19 health protocols. We trust that this can be verified at the source provided. To insinuate that a pregnancy test was carried out on a student, for whatever reason therefore, is a highly unfortunate conjecture.\n\nNevertheless, our processes would be readily opened up for the scrutiny of regulators and stakeholders at the earliest indication of this, to enable the course of scientific or forensic inspections. We are certain this will lay to rest any shred of doubt or hazy optic that the present flurry of activities might have occasioned.\n\nFinally, we assure parents and guardians that we take unequivocal cognisance of the duty of care entrusted on us and we would never betray this, as we are more than ever resolved to work harder at keeping and building the trust reposed in us. We refuse to indulge in or give credence to the sentimental contrivances seeking to fuel this crisis the more with various renditions that have taken over the social media space. The only account we are obligated to render is how well the children entrusted in our care have been managed, as we have excelled in doing in this past 45 years of our existence as an educational institution, and to ensure that in this whole development, the only winners here shall be this children.",

A full-scale investigation has been done and the parents of all the culpable learners have been duly notified of the necessary punishment meted out on the learners.\n\n\u201cThe parents gave their full cooperation realising the need to work with the school so that the learners can be corrected and be of expected proper behaviour henceforth.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the course of the school\u2019s efforts to see how best we can help\u2026who was a major participant in the whole incident, every effort to inform you as her parents about the incident and ensure that this improper behaviour is permanently corrected, has proved to be futile.\n\n\u201cWe cannot as a school condone such. Consequently, (the student) is hereby placed on an indefinite suspension until you as the parents ensure that she is punished, adequately counselled and rehabilitated.\u201d\n\nPregnancy test carried out on my child without my consent, mother cries for help\n\nThe mother of the student expressed displeasure over how the school handled the incident, saying, \u201cmy daughter was dying in silence and she couldn\u2019t speak.\n\n\u201cThey threatened to kill her if she speaks and conducted a pregnancy test on my daughter without our consent.\u201d\n\nThe mother, in a video, also lamented that the school \u201clied\u201d to her that what happened was \u201ca kiss\u201d until another parent showed her the video of the \u201cimmoral act\u201d.\n\nAccording to her, the daughter said the \u201cimmoral act\u201d happened under the influence of drugs.\n\nShe said, \u201cMy child attends Chrisland School VGC. Please, I am making this video to beg Nigerians to get justice for me.\n\n\u201cAbout a month ago, I was on my way out of Lagos when I got a call from the head teacher in Chrisland; she said she wanted to see me and so two days later I went to the school.\n\n\u201cI got to the school and I met their representatives.\n\n\u201cThey said they wanted me to know that my daughter whom I left in their care on a trip to Dubai had a kiss with a boy and the boy also kissed her.\n\n\u201cThey found out that they got the kissing idea through \u201cTruth and Dare\u201d and advised that I should caution my daughter and take her phone from her.\n\n\u201cI said okay, if it is just that, I was going to collect the phone from her. Mrs Kemi also advised me not to tell my husband that it is not everything a woman should tell her husband. I thought the issue wasn\u2019t more than that; so it ended then.\u201d\n\n\u2018What my daughter told me\u2019\n\nThe mother claimed her daughter was suspended after she confronted the school authorities.\n\n\u201cA parent called me that she needed to see me urgently. I went to her house and she told me that something had been trending in Chrisland and she believed I was not aware. The woman showed me the video and told me that all the parents were aware. Immediately, I informed my husband.\n\n\u201cBecause we had started confronting them that we were aware of what they did, the school sent her a suspension letter.\n\n\u201cWhen my daughter explained to me what happened, she said that they went out in the morning to have breakfast and one of the boys begged her to lend him her phone charger which she obliged. After they had dinner, the boy called her room that she should come and take her charger. She went there for her charger.\n\n\u201cWhen she got into the room, one of them said she should take her charger from the toilet; it was when she entered the toilet that they told her to take a substance, so they were all under the influence. She said after that she did not know what she was doing again.\n\n\u201cPlease, I am begging Nigerians to help me because Chrisland is trying to hide this issue. They are trying to push us out of the way and my daughter is affected psychologically. Please, I need help as a mother. I am begging fellow Nigerians to help me.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\nAmid rising nationwide security challenges and the accompanying criticism of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government, the Presidency has said critics of the administration \u201cuse their mouths to divide the country.\u201d\n\nSpecial Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said this Monday in Abuja.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile absolving Buhari of any blame in the nation\u2019s security challenges and the attendant hardship, Adesina said President Buhari had done more to unite Nigeria than any other leader in the history of the nation. The Presidency\u2019s position is coming in the midst of several criticisms, including that from the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF) and the Easter Message of Bishop of Sokoto Diocese Matthew Hassan Kukah.\n\nWhile NEF asked Buhari to resign over the rising security challenges, Kukah in his message Sunday, said Nigeria had become divided and destroyed under the Buhari administration.\n\nAlthough the presidential aide\u2019s response was not directed at anybody or group, but Adesina, via his Twitter handle Monday said those criticising Buhari were the same people dividing the country with their comments.In the post, he said it was surprising that those who were guilty of creating \u201cdivision with mouths in Nigeria are the ones accusing the President of the same crime they committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who divided Nigeria with their mouths, with evil, unguarded speaking, are the ones now accusing President Buhari. How sad! Their wicked intentions shall not come to pass,\u201d Adesina further wrote.\n\nBandit leader\u2019s threat Meanwhile, Nasanda, a notorious bandit leader in Zamfara state, has threatened to kill 300 people if the state government fails to pay him N30 million as compensation within two weeks as compensation for the killing of his wife, uncle and aunt by the state\u2019s vigilante officials.\n\nIn a recorded audio message trending on social media Sunday, Nasanda issued the state government a 14-day ultimatum to pay him the money or face his wrath of killing 300 people, a hundred each for his murdered relatives.\n\nHe described the murder of his wife and relatives as deliberate, saying the vigilante men knew they were related to him and only decided to kill them to spite him.\n\nThe terrorists further said they were only being realistic and not greedy in asking for the N30 million compensation as their leader was advised by some people to demand N50 million per person.\n\nNasanda, who spoke in Hausa language said: \u201cI am not giving months, but 14 days, for my demands to be met. And we will not attack until when people are on their farms. If our Fulani people are not allowed to live in peace, we will also not allow others to live in peace.\n\n\u201cIf the government can\u2019t pay the money, I will do what I am used to. That is I will take the life of 300 people to avenge the death of my bride and two of her relations. Yes, the lives of 300 will be in danger.\u201d\n\nBoth the Zamfara state government and the state Police command did not respond to the threat as at the time of this report.\n\nSpecial Adviser to Governor Bello Matawalle on Public Enlightenment, Media, and Communications, Zailani Bappa, could also not be reached.",

I assure you that I\u2019m a listener, I will listen to everybody but I will not be able to solve each and every problem of the individual.\n\nAlkali had worked in Ministries of Justice, Police Affairs, and the State House. His last posting was at the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development as the Permanent Secretary before his deployment to the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Director Overseeing the Office of the Permanent Secretary, Engr. Chukwunwike Ogbonna Uzo, welcomed the new Permanent Secretary and said that it was his first time for over thirty-three years of service to witness a Permanent Secretary taken over in a Ministry and all his former directors accompanying him. That tells you the kind of person the new Permanent Secretary is. The people he is leaving behind are not happy losing him. But it is a gain to us in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,\u2019\u2019 Uzo said.\n\nUzo handed over two sets of handover notes, that of the former Permanent Secretary and that of when he acted as the Director Overseeing the Permanent Secretary\u2019s Office.",

President, Federal Republic of Nigeria & 42 Ors. and, therefore, the issue is sub judice.\u201d\n\nIn addition, it noted that the states have also filed a Motion on Notice for an Order of Injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe letter added that the body\u2019s legal representatives had published a public caveat in national dailies notifying the public of the pending appeal, which also advised concerned parties \u201cto desist from dealing with the subject matter thereof pending the hearing and determination of the Appeal and the application for Injunction pending appeal\u201d.\n\nIt said that given the above, \u201cThe law requires you to restrain from taking any step whatsoever that is capable of interfering with the rest of the suit, which is now a subject of an appeal.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Nigerian case law enjoins you to refrain from effecting any deduction whatsoever from the allocations due to the 36 States from the Federation Account for the liquidation of the London/Paris Club Loan refund-related judgment debts purportedly on behalf of the 36 States of the Federation and the 774 local government councils, pending the hearing and determination of the appeal by the states of the federation.

          "text": "Troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have killed 10 Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) commanders, as well as over 100 terrorists during land and air clearance operations along the fringes of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nThe operation codenamed Operation Lake Sanity is a joint and combined operation involving the MNJTF troops from Nigeria, Niger, and Cameroon and troops from Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK- Nigeria) as well as the Air Task Forces of the MNJTF and OPHK, other security agencies and the Civilian Joint Taskforce (CJTF).\n\nAccording to a statement by the spokesman for the MNJTF, Colonel Muhammad Dole, some of the areas cleared by the troops include Zanari, Arina Woje which served as a major fabrication workshop for the terrorists.\n\nOther areas include Asagar, Larki, Garere, Kerenoa, Wurje, Arege, Abadam, Doron Lelewa, Kolaram, and several other locations around the islands.\n\nHowever, 18 soldiers were wounded while three others and a member of the CJTF paid the supreme price during the operation.\n\nREAD ALSO: Osinbajo Prays For Restoration, Prosperity In Nigeria\n\nDole said the terrorists and their commanders were neutralised within the period of the operation, following intelligence-driven lethal airstrikes in the Lake Chad islands by the combined air task forces.\n\nHe listed some of the commanders killed to include Abubakar Dan Buduma, Abubakar Shuwa, Abu Ali, and Abu Jubrilla, among others.\n\nDuring the operation, several sophisticated weapons of different calibres were either destroyed or captured, including a 105 mm artillery piece, several canoes/boats, motorcycles, and bicycles.\n\nOther terrorists\u2019 equipment, several Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) making factories, and bunkers were also destroyed while a significant number of innocent citizens mostly women and children held captive by the criminals were said to have been rescued.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cRecent activities of the operations include a clearance patrol to Fedondiya settlement where logistics and foodstuffs, including several bags of maize and beans, motorcycles, some immobilised and cannibalised military and civil vehicles were discovered.\n\n\u201cOthers, including grinding machines, other vehicle fabrication tools, and military uniforms, were all destroyed and set ablaze in the location. It is obviously a big Boko Haram /ISWAP camp having another large IED-making and vehicle-borne IED-making factory that was cleverly camouflaged to prevent detection from the air.\n\n\u201cIn a related development, the MNJTF troops on clearance patrols in the general areas of Kimeguna near the Lake Chad in Niger republic accosted BHT/ISWAP logisticians ferrying 457 bags of fish in several carts. The bags of fish were immediately destroyed in line with the MNJTF Standing Operating Procedure while the suspects are being profiled.\n\n\u201cThe obviously frustrated criminals \u2013 BHT/ISWAP have resorted to the indiscriminate laying of IEDs and use of vehicle-borne explosive devices to attack. One pattern noticed in the operation is that the criminals hastily withdraw and avoid making contact with the approaching troops.\n\n\u201cThey instead rely on suicide vehicle-borne attacks. About four different such attacks have so far targeted the determined troops who have not been deterred. Sadly, 18 soldiers, including an officer have been wounded in these attacks and have been evacuated to various military medical facilities for treatment while three soldiers and one member of the CJTF paid the supreme sacrifice\u201d.\n\nIn his reaction, the Force Commander of MNJTF, Major General Abdul Ibrahim, commended the troops and the CJTF for their courage and commitment.\n\nWhile paying tribute to the members of the operation who paid the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty, he described them as heroes who would never be forgotten.\n\nIbrahim also prayed for the quick recovery of the wounded heroes and urged the troops to be resolute and bold to finally eradicate the criminals from the Lake Chad areas.",

We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support.\n\n\u201cWe are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time.

          "text": "The tensions of lockdown have exposed divisions among Shanghai residents, pitting young against old, locals against outsiders, and above all, COVID-negative against COVID-positive people.\n\nShanghai\u2019s 25 million people, most of whom live in apartment blocks, have forged new communal bonds during the city\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, through barter and group buying and setting up food-sharing stations.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nBut with no end in sight to a lockdown that for some has lasted four weeks, frustrations are also mounting behind the shuttered gates of the city\u2019s tower blocks, often playing out within WeChat message groups.\n\nIn one, conflict erupted when a woman who had been taken to centralised quarantine \u2013 where she tested negative \u2013 accused her neighbour of reporting her to authorities.\n\nIt is not unusual for test results to be shared and positive cases announced in building WeChat groups, as authorities try to get to grips with China\u2019s largest outbreak since the virus was first identified in Wuhan in late 2019.\n\nOne US citizen was told she would be sent to a quarantine centre after results from a mixed test, including hers, came back positive last week, sparking panic. Three others whose samples were in the batch were taken to quarantine, but her own at-home tests continued to be negative.\n\n\u201cIn the group chats, they were saying things like, \u2018oh are the positive people still here, are the positive people still here?\u2019,\u201d she said, declining to give her name.\n\nOlder residents, more vulnerable to COVID-19, have also been more likely to call for the immediate expulsion of positive cases from their compound.\n\n\u201cBecause of the media\u2019s exaggeration about the disease, and since old people have weaker immune systems, they are more afraid of the virus than young people,\u201d said one resident who had seen this happen.\n\nAnother foreign resident, who only wanted to be identified as Alexy, was suspected by neighbours of being COVID-positive when his test result failed to upload to his health app.\n\nHis building\u2019s management tried to block his family\u2019s food deliveries unless they shared home test results with the rest of the residents \u2013 a demand that several Shanghai residents have said is widespread and violates privacy.\n\n\u201cThey have no guidelines and CDC (Center for Disease Control) services are overwhelmed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey felt invested with the most important mission of their life, being able to play doctor, policeman and judge at the same time.\u201d\n\nLOCKED-OUT\n\nSome people were refused entry into their homes and ordered to stay in hotels after release from central quarantine, violating state guidelines.\n\nAnother foreign resident who tested positive said she was confined in her apartment rather than sent to central quarantine, much to the chagrin of her neighbours, who asked her to leave, tried to exclude her from group grocery orders and even demanded she make a formal apology.\n\nOne neighbour called her \u201cforeign trash\u201d while another spread lies about her mental health, and the residential committee was no help, she said.\n\n\u201cI saw screenshots of them telling the residents to continue calling to get me out,\u201d she said, adding that she would move out as soon as she could.",
