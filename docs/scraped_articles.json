          "title": "Has Boko Haram infiltrated Bauchi? Here\u2019s what Vanguard knows",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nFile image\n\nBy Charly Agwam \u2013 Bauchi\n\nA few weeks ago, the country was thrown into confusion as to whether Boko Haram members had infiltrated four Bauchi communities sharing boundary with Yobe state after an emergency meeting held by Bauchi state government in collaboration with security agencies and the traditional institution.\n\nThe reason for the emergency meeting, according to the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mohammed Sabiu Baba during a briefing with newsmen was to examine the implication of Boko Haram\u2019s activities in Geidam and plan for how to contain it from the Bauchi side.\n\nBaba also hinted during the briefing how an MTN communication mast in Gamawa local government area of the State was vandalized by criminal elements, a threat which the State government suspected to be a fallout of the attack on Geidam, Yobe State by members of Boko Haram.\n\nHis words: \u201cToday, we had a meeting to discuss the crisis caused by Boko Haram in Geidam and its implications in Bauchi. Bauchi state is sharing borders in four local government areas, namely Zaki, Dambam, Gamawa, and Darazo. The implication of what happened in Geidam is that there is a lot of influx of people moving into Bauchi state from Yobe.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that we continue to profile whoever is coming to Bauchi state. I can tell you that some people come in with weapons, and it is the profiling that will help us stem that type of problem. Apart from that, any criminal activity that is noticed among us should be promptly reported to the security agencies.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the government held a meeting with the Commissioner of Police, Director Department of State Service, Commandant of Civil Defense, Brigade Commander, and the Head of Air Force in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cThey all assured to give maximum cooperation in our attempt to have a joint patrol. Of course, security is the responsibility of all of us. We do not expect that the security agencies alone will do the work, so all hands will be on deck, including our traditional institution and religious groups.\u201d\n\nAlthough the SSG in his statement did not explicitly say there was Boko Haram in Bauchi State, feelers are that because he implied that the attack on MTN mast in Gamawa local government area was carried out to breach security in the area, some reporters (not ours) thought that he was referring to Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cRecently, an MTN facility in Gamawa local government area was attacked by criminal elements. And as we know, such things are usually done by criminal elements in an attempt to make security impossible in that area.\n\n\u201cThat threat has been identified and the culprits have been apprehended and the properties have been recovered. Those bad eggs that have already settled, we are sensitising our people to report anybody that they are not very comfortable with.\n\n\u201cThe state government will ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies will be intensified particularly, air surveillance around the affected LGAs. Some bandits have been arrested for vandalizing the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for the attack,\u201d he added.\n\nHe went further to lament that the influx of displaced persons from Yobe State was putting strain on the facilities in the affected four local government areas\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOf course, that is putting a lot of strain on our facilities and considering the kind of movement from the outcome of Boko Haram activity, the security implication is also very high. The meeting today was to examine the implication of that (Boko Haram activity in Geidam), and plan for how to contain it from the Bauchi side.\n\n\u201cAs for those that are displaced persons, government officials will identify them in order to provide relief materials for their well-being because the government will not just watch them suffer. The gateway LGAs are Gamawa, Dambam, and Zaki which are sharing boundaries with Yobe state and close to the seized Geidam by Boko Haram terrorists.\u201d\n\nHowever, following the press conference with the SSG, several media outlets had erroneously reported that Boko Haram has infiltrated and overrun Dambam, Zaki, Gamawa, and Darazo local government areas which also followed a statement by the Special Adviser, Media to the governor, Muhktar Gidado in which he debunked the reports\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to a viral publication by a cross-section of newspapers and online medium where they erroneously reported that Boko Haram fighters raided Bauchi communities.\n\n\u201cIn order to set the records straight and correct the erroneous misrepresentation that is in the public domain, I wish to state as follows: that no Single attack by Boko Haram or any criminal elements in the four (4) local government areas or any local government area for that matter.\n\n\u201cTo report that the Boko Haram invaded these Local Governments was entirely false and mischievous. It is therefore pertinent for all to respect the Security and integrity of our State. We must as Journalists not report war where none exists.\n\n\u201cMost of you were in attendance when the SSG spoke, he made no mention of any attack on any of the 4 local government areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Special Adviser further made known the State government\u2019s plan to provide a palliative for the displaced persons.\n\n\u201cIn order to bring succor to people fleeing Gaidam and Kenam residents from Yobe State after the attack by the insurgents, His Excellency, Governor Bala Mohammed has approved the immediate supply of relief materials to cushion the hardship being experienced by the refugees in the four local government areas.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a break-down of the commodities that are, as I speak being loaded for onward transportation to the affected areas. The items include 1,750 bags of rice, 1,050 bags of maize, 1,750 bags of sorghum, 1,050 cartons of spaghetti, 350 bags of sugar, 3,500 cartons of indomie,\u201d he added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nTo provide platform for Ayade\u2019s future political aspirations, negotiations\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, on Friday put paid to speculations regarding zoning of party offices and elective positions in the country, saying the party belongs to all Nigerians and that everyone from any part of the country is free to vie for any position.\n\n\u201cAPC belongs to all Nigerians. Everyone, from every part of the country, is free to aspire for any position in the party in line with provisions of our party\u2019s constitution and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. The guiding philosophy as enshrined in the provisions of our manifesto is economic, social, and political development of Nigeria\u201d, the governors declared.\n\nThis came as they pledged to yield the platform of the party to its new entrant, Gov Ben Ayade of Cross River State to actualise his future political aspirations and viable negotiations.\n\n\u201cGiven all his achievements in Cross River State, Mr Ayade is only coming home where he belongs. APC is indeed the party that will provide him and his people, and indeed all Nigerians the viable platform for political aspirations and negotiations\u201d, the governors said in a statement by their Chairman and Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu.\n\nBagudu said, together with Mr Ayade and all leaders in the APC, \u201cour party\u2019s capacity to serve the collective interests of all Nigerians through effective representation will be strengthened and reinforced\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur party, APC, is open, transparent, and will continue to guarantee fair contestation in politics, in line with the overarching commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari and all our founding leaders. Our National Caretaker Extraordinary/Convention Planning Committee has worked hard to restore the political credentials of the APC as a strong institution for Nigeria\u2019s democratic development\u201d, he added.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nWelcoming Prof Ayade to their fold, the governors said the political and democratic credentials for President Muhammadu Buhari have continued to attract more people to the APC.\n\n\u201cThe Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, welcome His Excellency, Mr Ben Ayade, Governor of Cross River State to the All Progressives Congress, APC. We join all leaders and members to welcome this illustrious Nigerian into our great party.\n\n\u201cThe decision of Mr Ayade to join the APC is a testament of our party\u2019s capacity to mobilise all Nigerians consistent with the vision of the founding fathers to ensure that the APC is a platform to unite all Nigerians. The coming of Mr Ayade into the APC further reinforces the process of membership and leadership recruitment at all levels\u201d, the APC governors added.\n\nAfter several weeks of permutations about his political trajectory, Prof Ayade had on Thursday dumped his erstwhile Peoples Democratic Party PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress APC.\n\nChairman, APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Yobe state Governor, Hon. Mai Mala Buni and several other governors of the APC had received Ayade on Thursday in Calabar.\n\nThe governors in their statement said; \u201cWe congratulate our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, whose sterling qualities and fair-mindedness endear patriotic Nigerians to the party.\n\n\u201cMr President\u2019s credentials as a fair leader who is impartial will continue to promote our party and serve as a major source of electoral advantage. As Progressive Governors, we will remain steadfast in supporting the efforts and initiatives of Mr President to build our party, APC, as a strong and democratic political party in the country.\n\n\u201cAlso, we salute our members of the APC National Caretaker Extraordinary/Convention Planning Committee under the leadership of HE Mai Mala Buni for this milestone achievement of once again getting another experienced leader in the person of His Excellency Ben Ayade to join the APC.\n\n\u201cWe welcome Mr Ben Ayade for taking the courageous decision of leaving the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party PDP to join our party, the All Progressives Congress. The movement of our compatriot to the APC is indicative of his principles, commitment, and conviction to the development of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to support the National Caretaker Extraordinary/Convention Planning Committee in all its current initiatives to rebuild our great party. With the coming of Mr Ayade, the capacity of our party to mobilise all patriots and other like-minded progressive Nigerians to join the APC is stronger.\n\n\u201cThe Progressive Reinforcement of our party continues. We look forward to receiving more patriots and progressive-minded Nigerians into the APC.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

General Tukur Buratai (rtd).\n\n\u201cNigeria First wonders how allowances of soldiers and officers would be left unpaid over 5 years, and it would go undetected given the periodic scrutiny of the expenditure of the Nigerian Army in the prosecution of the war against terrorism and other acts of criminalities across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thus becoming evident that the promoters of the campaign of calumny didn\u2019t do their homework well to realize that under the leadership of Buratai, the Nigerian Army indeed responded to a Freedom of Information request by a coalition of civil society organizations led by the SERAP, BudgIT and Enough is Enough (EiE), requesting for information on spending on military operations across Nigeria, particularly in the Northeast.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that not only was the request honoured, but the coalition of civil society groups went further to commend Buratai, wherein it stated that \u201cwhile we ascertain the level of compliance of the information provided, we welcome Buratai\u2019s demonstrated commitment to the Freedom of Information Act by responding to our request.\n\n\u201cNigeria First wishes to state that this is indeed the height of mischief that all well-meaning Nigerians must resist as it\u2019s tantamount to insulting the sensibilities of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a statement that the performance of the former service chiefs while in office remains outstanding.\n\n\u201cNigeria First wishes to put it on record that Buratai ought to be regarded as one of the heroes of our democracy in Nigeria for his efforts at entrenching transparency and accountability while in office.\n\n\u201cNigeria First wishes to inform members of the general public to disregard the recent attack launched against the former service chiefs as it\u2019s dead on arrival for lacking in merit.\u201d",

The IGP noted that the security alert, rather than becoming a source of panic to the citizens, should instead send a message of re-assurance to them about the intelligence depth, capacity and operational preparedness of the Nigeria Police to preemptively deal and contain any threat to public peace and security. The alert does not in any way suggest that an attack is imminent in any of the two States.\n\n\u201cThe Police High Command therefore calls for calm, urging citizens to go about their normal activities with renewed sense of vigour, patriotism and vigilance as the Police continue to work with other relevant stakeholders to keep our public space safe\u201d.",

          "text": "\u2022Say cattle restriction would be vigorously enforced\n\n\u2022Afenifere, Senate spokesman demand minister\u2019s removal\n\nDeji Elumoye, Olawale Ajimotokan, Alex Enumah, Udora Orizu in Abuja, James Sowole in Akure and Hammed Shittu in Ilorin\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday came under fire for criticising the open grazing ban by the 17 Southern governors at their recent meeting in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nMalami, while fielding questions on a live TV programme on Wednesday had kicked against the open grazing ban.\n\nThe AGF compared the Southern governors\u2019 decision to Northern governors banning spare parts trading in the North, considering the fact that the majority of spare parts traders in the North are from the South.\n\nHe had said: \u201cIt is about constitutionality. Within the context of the freedoms enshrined in our constitution, can you deny a right of a Nigerian? It is as good as saying maybe the Northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a Northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the North?\u201d\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s comments, the Southern governors dared him to challenge their decision in the court, saying that there is no going back on the open grazing ban.\n\nSome senior lawyers and the Founder of Stanbic IBTC and Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, also criticised the minister over his comments.\n\nHowever, the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the spokesman of the Senate, Senator Ajibola Bashir, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to remove the minister for opposing the ban.\n\nThe South-east Governors\u2019 Forum stated that those who oppose the ban want the killings by herdsmen to continue.\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, described Malami\u2019s opposition to the open grazing ban as \u201cwicked and arrogant.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement titled \u2018Our decision is irreversible and will be enforced,\u2019 asked the AGF to challenge the governor\u2019s position on open grazing in court.\n\nHe added that Malami\u2019s comparison of open grazing with the selling of spare parts is annoying.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distil issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr. Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the laws of the respective states banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.\u201d\n\nAfenifere, Senate Spokesman Demand Minister\u2019s Removal\n\nAlso reacting, Afenifere said the comment of Malami on the ban of open grazing by Southern governors, has exposed him as the most unfit for the office of the attorney-general and minister of justice.\n\nThe organisation, in a statement yesterday by the Secretary-General, Chief Olusola Ebiseni, said the comment of Malami did not come as a surprise to a discerning mind in view of his positions on certain national issues.\n\nIt said Malami\u2019s comments only pitiably exposed him as being most unfit for the office of attorney-general, having always allowed his sectarian disposition to becloud his eminent qualifications.\n\nIt said: \u201cMalami does not want serious-minded people to accord him and his high office each time he accepts to play the roles of errand boy and spokesperson of the Miyetti Allah and their herder-members.\n\n\u201cEach time Malami perceives a threat to the interests of Fulani herdsmen, he is quick to latch on to constitutional provisions, which are not relevant to the object of discourse.\n\n\u201cHe was readily on hand to vehemently denounce the Amotekun, South-west regional security initiative, as being targeted against Fulani herdsmen and so declared it unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cWhen challenged to approach the court, he had since developed cold feet.\u201d\n\nAfenifere stated that it is animal that is being prohibited from grazing openly and being moved by foot and urged Malami not to extend the inalienable human rights in the constitution to animals in the defence of a culture, which gives more care to cattle than human beings.\n\n\u201cIt is the same primitive mindset of which the Buhari administration has threatened the Governor of Benue State that he would have no place except he allowed a free reign of animals,\u201d the group said.\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, criticised Malami over his \u201cless than dignifying\u201d argument of equating open grazing with Southerners selling spare parts in the North.\n\nHe called on Buhari to, without further delay, remove Malami from office.\n\nThe senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District of Osun State, who spoke in his personal capacity yesterday, said equating the activities of archaic nomadic herdsmen destroying people\u2019s means of livelihood with others legitimately carrying on businesses by selling spare parts in their shops stood logic on its head.\n\nHe stated that the AGF might have forgotten that Nigeria is a federal system with the state governments empowered to make and implement laws for the peace, order and good government of or any part of their respective state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis power is derived from the constitution, which with the Land Use Act vested on the governors the management of all land within the territory of the state.\n\nThe lawmaker challenged the AGF to cite relevant sections of the constitution, which allow the herders to trespass on other people\u2019s land and destroy the crops in the guise of freedom of movement, adding that AGF\u2019s comment is less than patriotic.\n\nFalana, Other SANs, Peterside knock Malami\n\nSome senior lawyers have also berated Malami over his comments.\n\nMr. John Baiyeshea (SAN) described Malami\u2019s statement as demeaning, divisive and unfortunate.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe is not the Attorney-General for the Northern region for God\u2019s sake. His statement is so sectional and abusive. There is no iota of law in what he said.\n\n\u201cOpen grazing has been a bone of contention all over the country for so many years. Cows are (mis)led into people\u2019s farms by herders and they eat up the products in the farms. The farm owners cannot or should not even complain at all. The Fulani herdsmen will kill anyone who complains.\n\n\u201cSo, many valuable lives have been lost through such murderous acts of unrepentant savages. They are always so quick to kill, and nothing happens to them. They are never brought to justice. They seem to be the only tribe that has the license to kill, steal and destroy like the devil.\n\n\u201cFreedom of movement in the constitution, which the AGF and others in his camp are using to justify the evil being perpetrated by the Fulani is for human beings and not animals like cows.\n\n\u201cAnd such movements by human beings based on the freedom guaranteed by the constitution must be for lawful purposes. So, the spare parts sellers \u2013 of which our Igbo brothers are famous and successful entrepreneurs as geniuses \u2013 are doing legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cIf they engage in other illegal acts, they will run afoul of the law and will surely be checked. They do not use that for land grabbing or expansionist activities to annex other people\u2019s territories.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) said the position taken by Malami was not supported by the constitution.\n\n\u201cTo start with, the right to freedom of movement alluded to by him is accorded by Section 41 of the Constitution to Nigerian Citizens as different from Nigerian cows or cattle. This simply translates to the fact that while it is beyond a debate that every citizen is at liberty to move freely and reside anywhere in Nigeria, it does not follow that cows and cattle enjoy the same measure of latitude under the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe right given to citizens cannot be extrapolated to cows and cattle, simply put. Granted that it is a legitimate business to rear cows and herd cattle, the point is that if by doing any business, in any particular manner, the defence, public safety, public order, public morality or public health of Nigeria and Nigerians are being jeopardised, the constitution allows for the business to be prevented by law from being done in that manner. This is by virtue of Section 45 of the selfsame constitution that allows for the exercise of fundamental rights by the Citizens of Nigeria,\u201d he stated.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also faulted Malami\u2019s position.\n\nFalana said it was funny that Malami was ignorant of the fact that Northern governors had banned open grazing since January.\n\nAccording to him, comparing spare parts trading with open grazing is nonsensical.\n\nFalana stated that spare parts traders pay rents and have been known to be peaceful in their conduct.\n\nHe said the AGF\u2019s comparison was not applicable as the sellers of motor spare parts have not been accused of killing fellow citizens and destroying their property.\n\n\u201cBesides, those who sell spare parts outside their states of origin either acquire properties or pay rent for their lawful business,\u201d Falana stated.\n\nHe added that contrary to Malami\u2019s claim, only humans are guaranteed freedom of movement by the constitution and not animals.\n\nAnother human rights lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), also tackled Malami.\n\nAdegboruwa said the AGF lacked the powers to make proclamations for the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe proponents of open grazing support it with the right to freedom of movement granted under section 41 of the constitution. This section cannot be interpreted to violate other constitutional provisions, especially section 43 that grants the right to private or public property.\n\n\u201cYou cannot deploy the right to movement of person and cattle to violate the right of another citizen to own property, such as land or farmland, or else you become a trespasser. It is in this regard that I disagree with the honourable Attorney-General of the Federation when he said that the ban on open grazing is unconstitutional. That cannot represent a proper interpretation of the constitution, with all due respect.\u201d\n\nHe urged state Houses of Assembly that have proscribed open grazing to make laws to support their declarations.\n\nOn his part, Peterside warned that linking the resolution to ban open grazing in the South with right to free movement of persons is \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nReacting to the minister\u2019s comments, Peterside tweeted yesterday that freedom of movement of persons does not extend to cattle.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous to link a ban on open grazing to the constitutional right to the free movement of persons.\n\n\u201cThe latter does not extend to the free movement of cattle, goats, sheep etc through farms with the attendant destruction of somebody\u2019s harvest,\u201d he said.\n\nUmahi: Ban Opponents Want Killings to Continue\n\nIn a related development, the Chairman of South-east Governors\u2019 Forum and Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, has said that those kicking against the ban on open grazing as canvassed by Southern governors want killings to continue.\n\nAsked to respond to the claim by Malami that banning open grazing in the South is like banning the sale of spare parts in the North, Umahi told State House reporters in Abuja that those who hold that view misunderstood the situation.\n\nThe governor added that the South has no grazing routes, and allowing cows to move freely would mean trespassing on people\u2019s property.\n\nAccording to him, herder-farmer conflict gave rise to crises and killings, including the setting up of the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the South-east, we don\u2019t have grazing routes but in the North, we have cattle routes. Nobody is going to say ban open grazing in some areas in the North where there are cattle routes, where they move constitutionally from one point to the other. But in the South, there is no cattle route and for you to move from one point to the other, you have to move through farms, through population-dense areas. And this is what the Southern governors, South-east, in particular, are saying.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to our traditional method of relationship, we will no longer allow you to take your cattle from one local government to the other. And the implication is that these foreign herders also come as mobile herders with AK-47, and so that is the source of conflicts.\n\n\u201cSo, anyone that is saying that there should be no ban is, on the other hand, saying that these killings should continue and that is what has birthed to ESN. \u201cWhether we support it as governors or we don\u2019t, the people tend to support it because the foreign herders pretending that they are rearing cattle are killing people.\n\nWase Shuts down Motion to Call Malami to Order Over His Comment\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Idris Wase, at the plenary yesterday, shut down a motion by Hon. Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers), seeking to call Malami to order over his comment on the ban on open grazing.\n\nBob, while raising a point of order (Order 6 of House Rules Book), accused the minister of making inciting comments.\n\nThe lawmaker described Malami\u2019s comments as disingenuous, irresponsible and loaded with incendiary trope and ethnic slur, praying that he should be called to order.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker was stopped midway through his point of order by Wase who was presiding the session.\n\nWase asked the lawmaker to take a seat, saying that the order was wrongly cited.\n\nHe said: \u201dThe order in which you are bringing this matter is wrong. It\u2019s either you bring it as a full motion but coming under matters of privilege is wrong so take your seat.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has said that intellectual property waiver alone will not be enough to narrow the huge COVID-19 vaccine supply gap between rich and poor countries.\n\nShe told the European Parliament that it was clear that discussions around vaccine patents alone would not suffice, saying that global leaders should do more to ensure that there is equitable production and distribution of the jabs.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala said developing countries had complained that the licensing process was cumbersome and should be improved upon.\n\nShe added that while it makes sense to protect research and innovation, it is also important to expand access to the vaccines.\n\nAccording to her, manufacturers should work to expand production, pointing to idle capacity in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Senegal, and South Africa among other developing nations.\n\nShe said: \u201cI am convinced that we can agree on a text that gives developing countries that kind of access and flexibility, whilst protecting research and innovation.\n\n\u201cTo have solved the unacceptable problem of inequity of access to vaccines, we have to be holistic. It\u2019s not one or the other.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala stressed the importance of diversifying vaccine manufacturing and to have more production taking place in Africa and Latin America to contain the pandemic.\n\nShe told the EU legislators that normal market forces for exports and imports couldn\u2019t apply when it comes to the life-or-death issue of COVID-19 vaccines, as many of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations are hoarding the shots for their own population when the crisis hits their home turf.\n\nShe said although the world could manufacture some five billion vaccine doses overall, it now requires twice or three times that capacity due to the spread of the contagion.\n\n\u201cOne of the main challenges is diversifying vaccine production, which is now 80 per cent concentrated in 10 European, North American and South Asian nations, Okonjo-Iweala said, calling the situation a problem that \u201chas come home to roost.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not normal that Africa, with 1.3 billion people, has 0.17 per cent of the manufacturing capacity of the world. So this has to change.\u201d\n\nEU nations have criticised a call by the United States to waive COVID-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase supplies, saying that the move would yield no short-term or intermediate improvement and could even have a negative impact.\n\nHowever, Okonjo-Iweala sought to remain neutral on the issue, saying that WTO members could find the flexibility to make sure more vaccines are produced in developing nations.\n\nSouth Africa and India have urged fellow WTO members to waive intellectual property rights on vaccines to boost production.\n\nPoorer countries that make up half the world\u2019s population have received just 17 per cent of doses, a situation the World Health Organisation (WHO) has labelled \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d.\n\nThe EU outlined a plan on Wednesday it sees as a more effective way of boosting output, using existing WTO rules, rather than a waiver, noting that countries can grant licences to manufacturers to produce with or without the patent holder\u2019s consent.\n\nIn March, Nigeria received nearly four million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), from Mumbai through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to the vaccines.\n\nThe doses have now been largely exhausted even as India, a major contributor to the COVAX facility, battles to curb the growing number of infections and deaths in the Asian country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Bassey Inyang in Calabar and Sylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday hit home a rebound with the defection of Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAyade, who lost out at the recent state congress of the PDP, helped the APC to regain a foothold in the South-south, which had come under the full control of the main opposition party with the defection and reelection of Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, last year.\n\nUntil yesterday, the PDP controlled the six South-south states of Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\nAPC leaders had made efforts to make inroads into the oil-rich region in the 2019 election with the defection of the PDP Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who led the ruling party\u2019s charge but was roundly defeated.\n\nNext, it made an audacious move for Bayelsa State in the off-season governorship election, winning a pyrrhic victory, which was overturned by the Supreme Court due to the ineligibility of its deputy governorship candidate.\n\nBut the PDP downplayed its loss, urging its members in the state to remain steadfast in spite of the governor\u2019s defection.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on all critical stakeholders and teeming members of our party in Cross Rivers State to immediately pull together and ensure that all structure of our party in the state remains intact,\u201d it said in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan.\n\nThe party said it wished Ayade well in his new political sojourn as well as in his future endeavours.\n\nThe APC, however, congratulated Ayade for what it described as his wise and timely decision to leave a \u2018dead\u2019 PDP for \u201ca living and thriving party APC.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement yesterday, said the total lack of internal democracy, which turned the PDP into a one-man show had caused frustration and alienated PDP governors and legislators from the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe commended Ayade\u2019s decision to join forces with Buhari to build a better Nigeria as a member of the APC.\n\nThe Cross River State governor had after months of frustrations in the PDP elected to jump ship yesterday telling the APC governors who received him that he moved to put the state at the centre of national politics.\n\nAyade, who fell out with the PDP leadership after he lost control of the party structure to National Assembly members from the state attributed his decision to join APC to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s commitment to developing the country, and the need to join hands with the president to build a better Nigeria.\n\nThe Chairman of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, led a delegation of party bigwigs, including governors to Calabar to receive Ayade to the party.\n\nAyade announced his defection while hosting seven APC governors.\n\nBesides Bunu, other governors were: Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Senator Hope Uzodimma of Imo State; Hon. Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Senator Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; and Mr. Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nBefore formally defecting to the APC, he had held a two-hour meeting with the APC delegation.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state Deputy Governor, Prof. Ivara Esu; Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Eteng Jones; and members of the state House of Assembly, some National Assembly members, members of the Cross River State Executive Council, local government chairmen, councillors and some stakeholders, including Senator Florence Ita-Giwa.\n\nAyade said with his defection, Cross River State had become an APC state and urged all its supporters and followers to go to their respective wards and register with his new party.\n\nHe added that he caved in to pressure to join APC because of Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells to Akwa Ibom State, needed to be in sync with the party at the centre.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving seen and known the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point, we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of.\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognise that it is not the party that matters. It is character, it is honour, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation. We all need to work as a team ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if every one of us as governor joins hands with Mr. President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nBuni expressed joy at Ayade\u2019s defection.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Cross River State, formally to the APC. As from today, he is the leader of the party in the state.\u201d\n\nA chieftain of the APC from the state and former Senate Leader, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, also welcomed Ayade to the party.\n\nNdoma-Egba, in a statement yesterday, described Ayade\u2019s entry into the APC as a good development for the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you join us in the progressives fold, my expectation is that your coming will enrich our internal democracy and I enjoin you to be consultative, inclusive, democratic, transparent and accountable because these are the hallmarks of the All Progressives Congress family.\n\n\u201cI also expect that your presence in the APC will further strengthen the party and improve our electoral fortunes in Cross River State.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, described the defection of Ayade as liberation from the forces of retrogression.\n\nOmo-Agege, who is also the leader of APC in the South-south geo-political zone, hailed Ayade for seeing the need to improve his people\u2019s fortunes and further help cement national unity by bringing his state into the APC.\n\nHe said the governor had displayed uncommon courage in order to take Cross River State and the South-south out of the periphery to mainstream politics of the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "12-Year-Olds Among 300 Libya-Trained ISWAP Fighters Who \u2018Conquered\u2019 Boko Haram Leader, Shekau",
          "text": "Over 300 fighters loyal to the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) trained in Libya and other countries joined their colleagues in a long battle that led to the final fall of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to a report by Daily Trust, a fierce battle that lasted several days between the two factions led to the death of dozens of vicious commanders and hundreds of foot soldiers from both sides, with multiple sources saying Shekau has killed himself or fatally injured himself to the extent that he might not survive.\n\nIt was gathered that most of the fighters that fought for the defeat of Shekau on Wednesday were aged between 12 and 30.\n\n\u201cThey are actually children of some ISWAP members killed over time,\u201d a security source said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOthers are youths sourced during raids on multiple islands around the Lake Chad. The ISWAP carefully selected the youths. It was therefore much easier for recruitment as some of the youths willingly joined the group and others were forcefully conscripted.\n\n\u201cSome of them were born during the wartime and others were very young when their parents joined the group around 2002. After their parents died because of illness or confrontation with Nigerian troops, the children naturally took over and when the group split into two in 2016, those that moved on their own or forcefully taken to the shores of Lake Chad under the umbrella of ISWAP had an upper hand in terms of training because they were taken to Libya for training in guerrilla warfare and other purposes.\n\n\u201cOthers were sent to Syria and Somalia\u2026 They were taken to many countries abroad for training. However, those that came back especially between March and April this year took an active part in confronting Shekau in the last few days. They launched a serious offensive alongside other top commanders and fighters already on ground and they succeeded in taking over,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother credible source said some of the 300 youths were trained as \u201cmedical doctors, paramedics, engineers, IT specialists, bomb specialists and mechanics.\u201d\n\nHe added that among them were women \u201cwho serve as nurses or cooks while others have gun-handling skills, meaning they can partake in combat operations.\u201d\n\nHe said after their return from abroad, they were camped at a village called Shuwaram in Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nIt had been reported that ISWAP fighters, armed with sophisticated weapons had penetrated the infamous Sambisa Forest from different fronts and surrounded the place Shekau used as a safe sanctuary for years.\n\nThey reportedly killed many of his fighters and forced him to surrender.\n\nA signal from security sources indicated that when Shekau discovered that it was the end of the road for him, and ISWAP fighters had directed him to relinquish his position as the grand amir and successor to the founder of the group Mohammed Yusuf, he opted for suicide by detonating the explosives he strapped to his body.\n\nHowever, the AFP news agency reported that when Shekau reached the point of no return as he was surrounded by ISWAP fighters, he shot himself in the chest, fell on the ground while bleeding profusely but was whisked away to an unknown destination by some of his surviving loyal fighters.\n\nAnother source said ahead of the invasion of Sambisa by the factional group, one of the top commanders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and his lieutenants had visited the shores of the Lake Chad in the company with ISWAP leader Goni Mustafa.\n\n\u201cThe entourage were seen on two boats with ISIS flag. Some of those in the entourage were light-skinned people possibly from Libya or Syria. It was only Mustafa that was black. They first visited Marte before they proceeded to Sabon Tumbu.\n\n\u201cThey also visited Kirta, Kusuma and Kwallaram where they held meetings with commanders and other fighters,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source said after the strategy meeting, the visiting terrorists left and from that time, the ISWAP fighters started mobilising ahead of launching attacks on Sambisa Forest.\n\n\u201cSome of them gathered at Kurnuwa, Kayuwa and Tumbin Jaki before they launched the offensive. They had RPGs, GPMGs and AA guns on some vehicles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the attackers also moved their \u201cvulnerable women and children\u201d from the Marte area to some locations around Kukawa.\n\nAnother source said before they aimed at Sambisa Forest, the ISWAP fighters were responsible for the recent attacks in Damasak, Marte, Mainok, Dikwa and Maiduguri towns in Borno as well as in Geidam in Yobe State.\n\n\u201cThey did not target civilians in most of their attacks; rather, they launched attacks against constituted authorities including security forces. The group handpicked and killed people perceived as enemies such as members of a volunteer security group, CJTF.\n\n\u201cOn the other side, Shekau and his followers operated from the southern parts of Borno State, mostly around the Mandara Mountains, Sambisa National Park and the Alagarno forest. The group had carried out several deadly attacks on its targets including civilians. Shekau was strict on his followers and did not tolerate rebellious behaviour\u2026He had killed several of his renegade commanders and that was why many of those alive ditched him,\u201d he said.\n\nDaily Trust also reported that before the ISWAP fighters moved en masse to Sambisa, military operatives had launched several attacks on their hideouts in the northern parts of Borno State while air raids continued unabated.\n\n\u201cThe military had sustained onslaught against the group which has its hideouts in the semi-arid landscape with sparse vegetation. Their enclaves are being decimated and with time they will have no hiding place,\u201d he said.\n\nA source said the group allegedly resolved to dislodge Shekau with the intent of relocating to Sambisa and the mountainous areas to evade air attacks by the military jets.\n\n\u201cIt was not difficult for the group to locate and launch an attack on the Shekau-led base in Sambisa. There was fierce confrontation before Shekau succumbed and agreed to negotiate with ISWAP commanders. It was during the meeting that an explosion occurred and it was not clear whether or not Shekau was among those killed in the scene,\u201d the source said. He said it was likely that Shekau had survived the offensive and fled to another hideout.\n\n\u201cHe had survived several attacks in which he was proclaimed dead,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source said some of the followers of Shekau who were forced to flee the violent confrontation had sought refuge in different locations in the forest and were ready to pay \u201cdeep allegiance\u201d to anybody declared as overall leader.\n\nA security situation report trending on social media said Shekau must have been killed during the struggle.\n\nThe reports stated that: \u201cOn 19th May 2021, about 1829hours, ISWAP top fighter Baana Duguri-on this selector \u2013 geolocated around Sambisa Forest, Pulka, Gwoza LGA, BRS, informed ISWAP logistics commander Modu-Sulum- geolocated opposite General Hospital Konduga LGA Borno State that they killed Abubakar Shekau, overall BH leader in Sambisa Forest.\n\n\u201cDuguri disclosed that the ISWAP fighters\u2019 team surrounded the BH leader with his team and shooting ensued between the 2 factions. Duguri further added that Shekau detonated a bomb and killed himself when he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Duguri informed Sulum that the two sides also lost some fighters during the shooting\u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian military had reportedly placed all Borno State commands of the Nigerian Army and Air Force on alert.",

They launched a serious offensive alongside other top commanders and fighters already on ground and they succeeded in taking over,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother credible source said some of the 300 youths were trained as \u201cmedical doctors, paramedics, engineers, IT specialists, bomb specialists and mechanics.\u201d\n\nHe added that among them were women \u201cwho serve as nurses or cooks while others have gun-handling skills, meaning they can partake in combat operations.\u201d\n\nHe said after their return from abroad, they were camped at a village called Shuwaram in Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nIt had been reported that ISWAP fighters, armed with sophisticated weapons had penetrated the infamous Sambisa Forest from different fronts and surrounded the place Shekau used as a safe sanctuary for years.\n\nThey reportedly killed many of his fighters and forced him to surrender.\n\nA signal from security sources indicated that when Shekau discovered that it was the end of the road for him, and ISWAP fighters had directed him to relinquish his position as the grand amir and successor to the founder of the group Mohammed Yusuf, he opted for suicide by detonating the explosives he strapped to his body.\n\nHowever, the AFP news agency reported that when Shekau reached the point of no return as he was surrounded by ISWAP fighters, he shot himself in the chest, fell on the ground while bleeding profusely but was whisked away to an unknown destination by some of his surviving loyal fighters.\n\nAnother source said ahead of the invasion of Sambisa by the factional group, one of the top commanders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and his lieutenants had visited the shores of the Lake Chad in the company with ISWAP leader Goni Mustafa.\n\n\u201cThe entourage were seen on two boats with ISIS flag. Some of those in the entourage were light-skinned people possibly from Libya or Syria. It was only Mustafa that was black. They first visited Marte before they proceeded to Sabon Tumbu.\n\n\u201cThey also visited Kirta, Kusuma and Kwallaram where they held meetings with commanders and other fighters,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source said after the strategy meeting, the visiting terrorists left and from that time, the ISWAP fighters started mobilising ahead of launching attacks on Sambisa Forest.\n\n\u201cSome of them gathered at Kurnuwa, Kayuwa and Tumbin Jaki before they launched the offensive. They had RPGs, GPMGs and AA guns on some vehicles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the attackers also moved their \u201cvulnerable women and children\u201d from the Marte area to some locations around Kukawa.\n\nAnother source said before they aimed at Sambisa Forest, the ISWAP fighters were responsible for the recent attacks in Damasak, Marte, Mainok, Dikwa and Maiduguri towns in Borno as well as in Geidam in Yobe State.\n\n\u201cThey did not target civilians in most of their attacks; rather, they launched attacks against constituted authorities including security forces. The group handpicked and killed people perceived as enemies such as members of a volunteer security group, CJTF.\n\n\u201cOn the other side, Shekau and his followers operated from the southern parts of Borno State, mostly around the Mandara Mountains, Sambisa National Park and the Alagarno forest. The group had carried out several deadly attacks on its targets including civilians. Shekau was strict on his followers and did not tolerate rebellious behaviour\u2026He had killed several of his renegade commanders and that was why many of those alive ditched him,\u201d he said.\n\nDaily Trust also reported that before the ISWAP fighters moved en masse to Sambisa, military operatives had launched several attacks on their hideouts in the northern parts of Borno State while air raids continued unabated.\n\n\u201cThe military had sustained onslaught against the group which has its hideouts in the semi-arid landscape with sparse vegetation. Their enclaves are being decimated and with time they will have no hiding place,\u201d he said.\n\nA source said the group allegedly resolved to dislodge Shekau with the intent of relocating to Sambisa and the mountainous areas to evade air attacks by the military jets.\n\n\u201cIt was not difficult for the group to locate and launch an attack on the Shekau-led base in Sambisa. There was fierce confrontation before Shekau succumbed and agreed to negotiate with ISWAP commanders. It was during the meeting that an explosion occurred and it was not clear whether or not Shekau was among those killed in the scene,\u201d the source said. He said it was likely that Shekau had survived the offensive and fled to another hideout.\n\n\u201cHe had survived several attacks in which he was proclaimed dead,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source said some of the followers of Shekau who were forced to flee the violent confrontation had sought refuge in different locations in the forest and were ready to pay \u201cdeep allegiance\u201d to anybody declared as overall leader.\n\nA security situation report trending on social media said Shekau must have been killed during the struggle.\n\nThe reports stated that: \u201cOn 19th May 2021, about 1829hours, ISWAP top fighter Baana Duguri-on this selector \u2013 geolocated around Sambisa Forest, Pulka, Gwoza LGA, BRS, informed ISWAP logistics commander Modu-Sulum- geolocated opposite General Hospital Konduga LGA Borno State that they killed Abubakar Shekau, overall BH leader in Sambisa Forest.\n\n\u201cDuguri disclosed that the ISWAP fighters\u2019 team surrounded the BH leader with his team and shooting ensued between the 2 factions. Duguri further added that Shekau detonated a bomb and killed himself when he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Duguri informed Sulum that the two sides also lost some fighters during the shooting\u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian military had reportedly placed all Borno State commands of the Nigerian Army and Air Force on alert.",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it now has plans to start an IMEI registration process.\n\nInternational Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a 15-digit number unique to every phone \u2013 a digital fingerprint that comes in handy for tracking or even blacklisting a stolen or missing phone.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government has directed the NCC to register the IMEI of phones within the country before July. According to Punch, the regulatory body disclosed this in its Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nIMEI registration will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWill Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information and does it count as a step too far that Nigeria wants to go the way of Turkey and Azerbaijan in enforcing IMEI registration?",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

Onyekachi Izukanne, Michael Ukpong, and Ruke Awaritefe, the co-founders of TradeDepot, were selected as Endeavor Entrepreneurs on May 18, 2021, at the 15th Virtual International Selection Panel (v-ISP #15). TradeDepot is a B2B eCommerce platform that allows retailers to order inventory through multiple channels (Mobile, USSD, and WhatsApp) and have it delivered the next day.\n\nWith a mission to build strong entrepreneurship ecosystems in high-growth markets including Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe & North America, Endeavor selects, mentors and accelerates the best high-impact entrepreneurs behind some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up companies, supporting them to scale their companies as well as drive economic growth and job creation.

The Endeavor network includes some of the world\u2019s most exciting scale-up entrepreneurs and most experienced mentors and investors. TradeDepot, a Factory-to-Retail distribution platform for Consumer Goods companies, is solving an important problem by organizing and digitizing an industry that affects the lives of millions of Nigerians. We\u2019re excited to support Onyekachi, Michael and Ruke with their mission of connecting retailers to manufacturers with mentorship and guidance as they continue to grow as leaders and scale TradeDepot.\u201d, said Tosin Faniro-Dada, the Managing Director & CEO of Endeavor in Nigeria.\n\nEndeavor Entrepreneur candidates go through a rigorous selection process which culminates in an International Selection Panel (ISP) where candidates are vetted by trusted mentors, drawn from Endeavor\u2019s extensive network of over 4,000 mentors across the world. As part of the process, TradeDepot was presented at the 15th v-ISP and was successfully selected in a unanimous decision by the panelists as part of a cohort of 13 entrepreneurs from 9 markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome Kachi, Michael, and Ruke to the Endeavor Entrepreneur network!

TradeDepot\u2019s mission is to consolidate this fragmented informal\n\nretail supply chain, connect the world\u2019s top consumer goods manufacturers to micro retailers on the streets of Africa\u2019s cities and support the informal retail sector with inventory financing to scale and grow.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time?

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Nigerian state governors have reached an agreement with the striking judiciary and parliamentary workers on the autonomy of the arms of government, according to a statement by the federal ministry of labour, Friday.\n\nThe resolution followed a \u201cstormy\u201d conciliatory meeting with the leaderships of the workers\u2019 unions on Thursday, the statement said.\n\nThe statement signed by Charles Akpan, the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations of the ministry, quoted the labour minister, Chris Ngige, as saying the implementation of the newly signed agreement would begin next week.\n\nMr Ngige said the workers would call off their strike as soon as the implementation begins.\n\nMembers of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria have been on strike since April 6, shutting down all courts across the country in agitation for the financial autonomy of the judiciary, particularly at the state level.\n\nLikewise, Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), members are also said to be on strike in some states over the denial of state Houses of Assembly their financial independence.\n\nMr Ngige presided over the meeting with the leadership of the two unions on Thursday the latest in the series of conciliatory talks.\n\nThe meeting was attended by the Secretary of the Presidential Implementation Committee on the Autonomy of the Judiciary and Legislature, Ita Enang, who doubles as the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Nigeria Delta Affairs.\n\nThe governors were not present, but Mr Ngige, who heads the federal government\u2019s negotiation team on the financial autonomy matter, said \u201dthey had agreed to the terms of the agreement\u201d.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES understands that the document signed by parties present at the meeting is to be passed to all the 36 governors to append their individual signatures.\n\nEfforts by our correspondent to confirm the position of the governors on the matter were unsuccessful as the director-general of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Asishana Okauru, did not immediately answer our reporter\u2019s calls or reply to his text message.\n\nAgreement\n\nThe meeting began at about 6.45 p.m. and ended at about 10.p.m. on Thursday with the adoption and signing of a Memorandum Of Action (MOA), the labour ministry\u2019s statement read.\n\nA major highlight of the MOA titled, \u2018Implementation of Financial Autonomy for the State Legislature and Judiciary\u2019, is Article D, \u201cupon which the suspension of the strike is predicated\u201d.\n\nThe implementation of the agreement will be \u201ctriggered as from Monday, May 24, 2021, when the April FAAC to states is expected to start dropping,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSpeaking after Thursday\u2019s meeting, Mr Ngige said the parties signed \u201cthe document containing the framework for each of the state governments to grant autonomy to their legislature and judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe noted that state governors had \u201cstudied the document and were in agreement with it\u201d.\n\nConfident that all the 36 state governors would sign the agreement, the minister assured that the implementation would \u201ccommence next week with the distribution of the April allocation from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\u201d\n\nThe assurance, however, tallies with a promise by the NGF chairman, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, in April that the implementation of the financial autonomy of the state judiciary and legislature would start by May ending.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018Historic\u2019\n\nThe minister described the signing of the document as \u201chistoric and a fundamental kick-starting of restructuring being clamored for by some Nigerians\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a restructuring that has granted autonomy to the state judiciary and legislature. I am happy that we are part of this history-making and that we made this history in the life of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nHe praised President Muhammadu Buhari for achieving \u201cthe feat through the instrumentality of the fourth alteration that gave birth to Section 121 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the Presidential Executive Order 10 and the establishment of the implementation committee.\u201d\n\nPresidential implementation committee speaks\n\nSpeaking earlier, Mr Enang, commended Mr Ngige for bringing his \u201cwealth of knowledge and experience\u201d to bear in resolving the crisis.\n\nMr Enang is the secretary of the presidential committee that saw to the issuance of Executive Order 10 by President Muhammad Buhari for the implementation of the financial autonomy of the judiciary and the legislature at the state level.\n\nHe blamed past administrations for turning blind eye to the autonomy of the legislature and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cWe struggled for this thing for 21years now since the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999 was promulgated. The autonomy was there. It was said not to be clear and was clarified, and clarified, but it was not obeyed by our brothers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe advocacy for the enforcement of Executive Order 10 by the presidential committee has not gone down well with the governors, who have, for years, foot-dragged on the implementation of the financial autonomy being demanded by the striking workers.\n\nThe 36 state governors at their meeting under the auspices of the NGF, had on Wednesday, called for the dissolution of the presidential committee led by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe governors accused the committee of \u201cbasically misguiding and overheating the relationship between State Governments and the other arms of government\u201d.\n\nJUSUN official speaks\n\nMeanwhile, the National Treasurer of JUSUN, Jimoh Musa, confirmed the signing of the MOA to PREMIUM TIMES on Friday.\n\nOur reporter asked Mr Musa if the signing of the agreement did not imply the union backtracking on its earlier rejection of the governors\u2019 proposed template for the implementation of the judiciary\u2019s financial autonomy.\n\nResponding, he said the proposal had been modified to suit the demand of the union.\n\n\u201cFor instance, an aspect of the agreement that gives the ministries of works of various states the role of executing construction projects for the judiciary has been removed upon our demand,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that a major highlight of the newly signed agreement is that the state judiciaries would receive their funds directly from the federation account as stipulated by the constitution.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that the implementation will begin next week. We will call off the strike once the state judiciaries gets their allocations from source,\u201d he added.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported how the union, in rejecting the governors\u2019 previous proposal, insisted on strict compliance with constitutional provision on financial autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nIt said the provisions of the constitution \u201ccannot be negotiated, doctored, manipulated and therefore must be obeyed\u201d.\n\nAs a condition to end its ongoing strike, the union had insisted that all the state judiciaries\u2019 funds for October 2020 till May 2021 must be deducted directly from the source, the federation account, and paid to the heads of courts through the NJC as prescribed by the constitution.\n\nHighlights of signed agreement\n\nThe statement issued Friday by the labour ministry gave some highlights of the new agreement.\n\nThe agreement read in part, \u201cThe governments of the respective States shall credit the Accounts of each State House of Assembly and each State Judiciary with the pro-rata amount due each of the two arms of Government under the 2021 Appropriation for each State in accordance with B(iii) of this Memorandum of Action commencing from April 2021 State Allocation from the State Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) as a sign of good faith.\n\n\u201cAnd the B(iii) in reference says \u201cwhenever there is Revenue shortfall, lower than the Budgeted fund, the monthly allocations to each arm of government shall reflect a percentage of the appropriated sum or an irreducible minimum amount to be allocated every month for the purpose of meeting its costs whichever is higher. This percentage will reflect as 100 per cent in Personnel Cost. The Running Cost and Capital Cost will be pro-rata of Revenue performance as per the State Appropriation Law.\n\nUpon fulfilment of the above, \u201c the ongoing Industrial Action shall be suspended with immediate effect from the date of the agreements contained in this Memorandum of Action (MOA), provided item D above is effected immediately and others effected within the 45 days window as prescribed in this MOA.\n\nThe framework adds, \u201cannually upon the determination of budget ceilings or envelopes from the Budget Committee of the State, anchored by the Budget Office of the State headed by the Commissioner in-charge, each arm of government \u2013 Executive, Judiciary, Legislature, acting through its own Budget and/or Funds Management Committee, shall prepare its Budget Estimates/Details and submit same to the State House of Assembly;\n\n\u201cThere shall also be established in each State a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to be given legislative backing in the various Fund Management Laws and charged with the responsibility to oversee the distribution of available resources to each arm of Government. Membership to reflect the template of the FAAC.\n\n\u201cEvery State Commissioner of Finance and State Accountant General shall on a monthly basis furnish the Committee with the revenue performance of the State within a stipulated timeline not exceeding 7 days after each FAAC meeting. Based on the revenue receipt, evaluations and the needs of each arm, the Committee shall work out an appropriate budget release based on the Appropriation for each Arm of Government for that year.\u201d\n\nThe Presidential Implementation Committee shall give a biweekly appraisal and follow-up.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Communication Commissions (NCC) has disclosed that network providers will be required to cross-check all phones International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and status on a proposed Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS) before allowing a device to become active on their network.\n\nThis is contained in the Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration published by the Commission, Vanguard reported.\n\nThe directive claimed the move was to curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile, phone theft, enhance National Security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) would be responsible for the implementation and management of the DMS to achieve the policy objectives\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS) will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and owners of such devices.\n\n\u201cIMEIs that have been reported as either stolen or illegal will be shared through the DMS to all the operators and service providers. The purpose is to ensure that such devices do not work even if different SIM Cards are inserted in those devices\u201d.\n\nThe Revised Policy publication also noted that the President, Muhammadu Buhari has directed \u201cthat the Device Management System should be implemented within three months.\n\nThis means any Nigerian who failed to comply will be unable to make calls, send text messages, or use the internet except through WiFi.\n\n\u201cDMS will also provide access to all operators to cross-check the IMEIs and their status before allowing a device to become active on their network.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, registered mobile phone technicians will also be provided with an interface to check IMEIs and ensure it has not been reported as stolen or illegal before they render their technical services\u201d.\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is an international identity number used to uniquely identify a mobile phone. The 15-digit IMEI number is an electronic fingerprint transmitted every time a phone is used, which reveals the identity of the mobile handset.\n\nHow can I find out my IMEI number?\n\nIMEI numbers are independent of the phone number and are usually written underneath the battery or on the back of the handset. Mobile phone users can also check their 15 digit IMEI number by dialing *#06# on their mobile handset.\n\nShould Nigerians be worried?\n\nYes! Although the IMEI can be used to reduce the cases of phone theft, the 15-digit number offers more power. It can give detailed information about a phone and its history. This is a concern. Not even in this era of rising data privacy concern across the globe. Such information in the hands of any governmental agency can be abused.\n\nHowever, some smartphone manufacturers such as Apple\u2019s Find My and Samsung\u2019s Find My Device already have features to track lost phones.\n\nWhich country has a similar policy?\n\nIndonesia currently operates a similar policy. The Indonesia Cell Phone Association (APSI) reported that almost 20% of all active phones in the country come from black market, costing the government annually, about $190.4 million in mixed tax revenues.\n\nThe IMEI control regulation in the country was scheduled to commence on April 18, 2020.\n\nBody of this report is credit to Vanguard",

          "text": "Cleft and Facial Deformity Foundation (CFDF) In partnership with TY Danjuma Foundation is offering free craniofacial surgery to indigent and facially deformed persons in Nasarawa State.\n\nSpeaking during the opening of the 24th free orofacial surgery and presentation of the Abuja Craniofacial Hospital for the poor, in Keffi, Nasarawa State, the executive director, CFDF, Dr Seidu Bello, said the foundation seeks to reach a minimum of 50 indigent persons, with over 3,869 beneficiaries since 2010.\n\n\u201cThe present 24th edition has witnessed a massive turnout of patients with different kind of facial deformities. As at today, 65 patients have registered. We have operated on 13 while surgery continues for one week. It is obvious that we cannot attend to everybody which is a wakeup call to the reality that the facial deformities are not rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur journey in the past 10 years has been fulfilling. We have traversed various hospitals in the FCT, Niger, Kogi, Taraba, Edo, Katsina, Oyo, Nassarawa and Delta States. We have succeeded in creating awareness about the scourge of facial deformities in various communities.\n\n\u201cWe have operated on close to 4000 patients out of about 7000 patients in attendance. One significant experience is the drastic reduction of adult cleft in Nigeria,\u201d the ED said.\n\nAccording to him, cleft and facial deformities have been associated with body pain and immense psychological disturbances brought about by social stigmatisation, adding that ffected people are socially dislocated and have their potentials destroyed.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason the foundation made it a point of duty to sensitise Nigerians about the scourge of cleft and other facial deformities in the society,\u201d said Bello.\n\nHe, however, said that there was drastic reduction of adult cleft in the country, bringing the country at par with the rest of the world where cleft surgery is essentially for the children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso, Bello made a public presentation of the Abuja Craniofacial Hospital for the needy. He said \u201cSustainability of the project will be guaranteed by the multiplier effect of a standard edifice capable of rendering care, training and research. We hope it will be a specialized referral hospital in SubSaharan Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cit is absolutely unacceptable that Nigerians still go about with glaring psychological disturbance of facial deformities in our society while the rest of us look elsewhere. Facial deformity is not an exclusive disease of the poor but the care of it requires funds and technical know-how.\n\nSpeaking on its partnership with CFDF, acting MD. TY Danjuma foundation, Gima forje, said \u201cThere are a lot of people with facial deformity in the country, and majority of them so not have access to medical care and treatment for a variety of reasons but largely do to challenges related to funding. That is why we are partnering with CFDF to ensure that people who otherwise could not have access to healthcare can have these services at their doorstep for free.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Nasarawa State Commissioner for Health, Pharm. Ahmed Baba Yahaya, representing the state government, commended the CFDF and TY danjuma foundation for the outreach.\n\nYahaya affirmed the government\u2019s support in taking care of the enlisted victims of cleft and other facial deformity.",

          "title": "Iyatsere faction in Warri kingship tussle allegedly shuns peace meeting",
          "text": "The relative calm in Warri town and OdeItsekiri (the ancestral home of the ethnic nationality) as Prince Tsola Emiko, the Oludesignate goes into \u201cIdeniken\u201d (seclusion) preparatory to ascending the throne of the kingdom can be likened to the peace of the graveyard.\n\nWhat has made this matter worse, according to most indigenes of Warri, is the silence of prominent Itsekiri sons and daughters all over the world, who seem to be watching developments keenly.\n\nHowever, one of the Itsekiri senior chiefs, who is also one of the kingmakers Chief Yayah Pessu, the Ojomo of Warri, alongside other concerned persons in the kingdom, are presently making frantic efforts to bring all the warring factions to the negotiations table before matters get out of control.\n\nSources said these efforts have been deliberately frustrated by one of the factions in the crisis as they have refused to cooperate with Chief Pessu\u2019s group. Chief Johnson Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group have allegedly refused to attend the peace initiatives, which took place in the residence of Chief Pessu, in the oil city on Friday, 14th May, 2021.\n\nAnd they have so far refused to give reasons why they were not present in the peace meeting, after they had earlier agreed to attend. However, the following persons were said to have attended the peace meeting according to Palace Watch sources: Chief Ayiri Emami, the suspended Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom; Chief Macgrew Richmond, Mr. David Iwere (the young man, who led the Itsekiri youths protest on May 7, 2021 at the Nigerian Police Zone 5 Headquarters in Benin City): Chief Thomas Ereyitomi (a representative of one of the constituencies in Warri at the National Assembly in Abuja); Chief Isaac Jemide (another kingmaker, who is the Oshodi of Warri Kingdom; Chief Kent Omatsone (former Speaker, Delta State House of Assembly); Chief S.E. Mene (an educationist); Chief Omawuli Akulagba and Pa. Chief Akoma Dudu, one of the oldest men in the Ginuwa ruling house, who was supposed to be the Regent under the present dispensation.\n\nThe Secretary to the Itsekiri Leaders of Thought and five other members were at the meeting. He was said to have apologized to the house that his leader could not attend the meeting because of other pressing issues. Chief Atserunleghe and his group, which is made up of Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh (the present Regent); Prince Yemi Emiko and others, especially representatives of the Ginuwa ruling house, who are major factor in the Warri crisis were conspicuously absent at the meeting.\n\nA chief in the Warri Palace, who was at the meeting but did not want his name mentioned, expressed disgust at the behavior of most members of this faction, saying: \u201cit sad and depressing, that these people have again refused to show up in this peace meeting.\n\nThese people needed to be here, if the present peace initiative is ever to succeed.\u201d Palace Watch heard that the absence of the Iyatsere group angered many members of the Ologbotsere faction, who travelled from very long distances to attend the peace meeting in Warri.\n\nAccording to our source, Chief Pessu, the Ojomo of Warri Kingdom at whose instance the peace meeting was called, was said to have made the following remarks, after the opening prayers at the meeting: \u201cI am motivated to call this particular peace meeting because of three major reasons.\n\n1- How to find an enduring peace in the kingdom, as the present development in the Warri nation since this crisis broke out, has not in any way helped our image as a people. It is therefore, commonsense that we cannot all fold our hands and watch while things continually degenerate the way and manner they are going.\n\n2- The meeting is also called to see how the missing crown, which is the symbol of the Itsekiri people is found and returned to the Warri Palace immediately.\n\n3 \u2013 As a Chief in Warri Palace, I was scandalized by a particular incident that happened at the Nigerian Police Zone 5 Headquarters in Benin City, the last time I went there.\n\nA statement made by one of the police officers, who is handling the Warri crisis at the Nigerian Police, Zonal Headquarters in Benin City, set me thinking seriously on how to get this matter resolved once and for all.\n\nOne of the Police officers, mockingly asked me, \u201cIf you people, the Warri Chiefs claim that it was the Ifa-Oracle that assisted you people as Warri Chiefs to arrive at the selection of Prince Tsola Emiko as the new Olu of Warri designate, why did the same Ifa, not help the warring Chiefs to locate the missing crown?\u201d\n\nIt was at this point, it dawned on me, that we should all immediately do, all within our powers to get this matter resolved once and for all, as no external body, will come and help us resolve our differences.\n\nHence this meeting.\u201d After his remarks, Chief Ayiri Emami, the suspended Ologbotsere of Warri Kingdom, who was present at the meeting, was said to have calmly asked Chief Pessu, why Chief Johnson Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group, especially Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, who is the present Regent and Prince Yemi Emiko, who are the moving forces behind the Iyatsere group, absent at the meeting?\n\nWas it that, you did not invite them to this meeting?\u201d Chief Emami then stressed, \u201cChief Pessu, if you really want to make peace you would have made sure the Iyatsere group, who are the aggressors in this crisis, are present at this meeting.\u201d\n\nChief Pessu, was said to have told the gathering, that he made efforts to reach the persons in question, and that they had promised to be present at the peace meeting. A furious Chief Macgrew Richmond was said to have told the gathering that he was present at the meeting because of his personal respect for Chief Pessu.\n\nHe then went ahead to question, \u201cwhy should I be invited to a meeting where the missing Warri crown is to be discussed?\n\nAgreed, I am a Chief in the Warri Palace, but I am not a member of the royal family and I don\u2019t even know, where any of these missing items are kept in the palace. I have never had access to such places in the Warri Palace.\n\nAs we all gather here, members of my immediate and larger families have been embarrassed continually over this missing crown, which I knew nothing about. My life has been threatened over this matter unreasonably.\n\nOn the 26th of May, 2021, is supposed to be the 30th anniversary of my marriage, and as a matter of practice over the years, I\u2019m always present in London with members of my immediate family to mark the day.\n\nBut sadly, I can\u2019t attend this year\u2019s celebration and can\u2019t attend to my immediate family needs, because of this matter.\n\nIf for any reason, I decide now to travel out of Nigeria although, I am granted bail by the Nigerian police on self-recognition, it will be misconstrued or rumored all over the place, that I have either jumped bail or gone to hide the missing crown, which I know absolutely nothing about its whereabouts.\n\nAnd as such, I\u2019m stuck here in Nigeria and can\u2019t move around and go about my daily businesses as I would have wanted to. But if invariably, the missing crown is eventually found and after the new Olu would have been installed, I will go to court to clear my name, as I can\u2019t just be called a thief, and I will allow the matter to go just like that.\u201d\n\nAfter a heated debate, and in an effort to calm Chief Emami and others down, the peace committee agreed to reach out to the Ginuwa Ruling House, especially Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, the present Regent to do a letter withdrawing Chief Ayiri Emami\u2019s purported suspension as Ologbotsere, as this move is likely to give room for further peace negotiation.\n\nChief Emami was said to have bluntly declined the proposal, saying \u201cthe Ginuwa Ruling House, has no powers to suspend me as Ologbotsere in the first instance, and why should I accept a letter from Okotie-Eboh to that effect? Secondly, this illegality called suspension, was carried out before he Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, ever became the regent.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly.was said, to have called for caution, and explained the implications of not finding the missing crown before a new Olu of Warri is crowned.\n\nHe was said to have told the gathering that in 2016, some months after the immediate past Olu of Warri, HRM Ogiame Ikenwoli, was crowned, the then Delta State Government refused to give him his due recognition as the Olu of Warri.\n\nAs alleged then, that Ogiame Ikenwoli was not given a staff of office by the state government, hence its refusal to give Ogieme Ikenwoli all his dues and recognition. It thus, took the Warri Palace quite some time to convince the Delta State Government that Olu of Warri does not take staff of office from the state government, as the symbol of Oluship in Warri kingdom is the crown, which is now missing.\n\nThe former speaker was said, to have wondered aloud, asking, if the present Olu of Warri is to be crowned, what will the Itsekiri people use to crown him as the Olu of Warri Kingdom?\n\nSince the symbol of the Itsekiri throne, the crown is now missing, he, therefore, appealed to all the people present at the meeting to join hands with all other concerned people to locate the missing crown.\n\nThe peace meeting also unanimously agreed, that Chief Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group, who are presently behaving as people who have conquered a territory, should be advised to thread softly and be open to all peace initiatives in the general interest of the Warri people.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u201cMy Mentor\u201d-Singer, Falz showers encomium on Father, Femi Falana as he turns 62\n\nThe peace meeting further agreed, that all efforts should be made, to ensure that the 1979 edict which stipulates every steps that should be followed before an Olu of Warri is crowned, is followed to the letter, as the Delta State government will later ask, after the new Olu of Warri would have been crowned, whether or not the Warri King Makers followed the laid down rules, if yes, the Attorney-General of Delta State will be demanding for evidence to this effect.\n\nPalace Watch contacted Chief Yayah Pessu, to find out how the peace meeting went, and why the iyatsere and his group did not turn up for the meeting.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have made some significant progress, even though Chief Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom and his group were unable to attend the meeting.\n\nWe are, however, confident and certain they will show up in our next meeting, which will hold very soon.\n\nIn the interim, we are reaching out to all concerned in this matter individually, and their responses have been quite encouraging, which is an indication that the much sought-after peace will be achieved any moment from now.\u201d\n\nPalace Watch made efforts to reach, the Chief Atserunleghe, the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, and Prince Yemi Emiko on this matter, but these efforts were not successful as they refused to pick the calls.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nThe monarchical system in Auchi Sacred Kingdom is tailored or modeled to revolve around the ordinary people of the kingdom, the Princes of the palace, the nobles, and of course, the Otaru of Auchi in council.\n\nThis system runs from bottom, the common man or woman on the street to the top, the Palace of the Otaru of Auchi, where major decisions concerning the general welfare and well-being of the people are looked into, after an exhaustive deliberation.\n\nIf an issue brought before the Otaru in council is accepted, decisions reached are immediately implemented. If rejected, such issues are dropped.\n\nFriday, May 14, 2021, was a breezy, wet and not too sunny day in Auchi Kingdom, after the heavy rains the previous night.\n\nIt was a day set outside by His Royal Highness, Alhaji Aliru H. Momoh, Ikelebe 111, the Otaru of Auchi and his Council members of Chiefs, to confirm the replacement of all the titles of \u201cDawudu\u2019s\u201d sectional heads in the Sacred Kingdom held by most people, who were now deceased.\n\nOther titles held by some Princes in the kingdom, which have become vacant, due to deaths, were also to be given out to deserving Princes and nobles in the kingdom, who were found worthy.\n\nREAD ALSO: No petrol price hike in June, says FG\n\nFor example, the title of \u201cYeri2mah of Auchi Scared Kingdom, hitherto held by Prince Tony Momoh before his death on February 1st, 2021, was on that day bestowed on another Prince, Barrister Azama Yusuf Kadiri, who is the first indigene of Auchi extraction to attain the position of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nAnother Prince, Said A.K. Momoh, was given the title of Madaiki of Auchi Scared Kingdom. While Prince Mojeed O. Momoh bags the title of Dania of Auchi Scared Kingdom, a position formally held by Prince Usman Abuda, another journalist, who died early this year.\n\nPrince Mohammed Lawal A.M.J Momoh, was made the Yamah of Auchi Scared Kingdom. Nine other persons alongside these four princes were honoured on that day with various titles.\n\nAs to be expected, as early as 7.30 in the morning on that day, the atmosphere in and around Auchi palace was already charged and full of expectations.\n\nAs the people to be turbaned and their guest began to troop into the palace ground for the day\u2019s event.\n\nAt exactly 8.30 am, the turbanning ceremony began and lasted up till 11.57 a.m. when the turnbaning of the last person on the list of the people for that day\u2019s event was completed.\n\nThe Otaru of Auchi, who had in company, the Adonojie of South-Ibie, HRH Oba Kelvin Danesi, and one other king from Estako land, began his open remarks as follows: \u201cAllah must be praised for making this very day possible.\n\nAllah has powers over whosoever he chooses, in the heavens and on earth. We all beg of Allah every day of lives for our daily needs, help and mercy.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cIf Allah has a matter to bring forth (such as giving honour to some persons, as we are doing today, he does so, it is also within Allah\u2019s powers to equally disgrace, whosoever he wish to.\n\nAllah alone gives life, and he alone also takes lives whenever it pleases him. It is absolutely within his powers and will to do whatsoever he desires. Allah alone has such exclusive powers (Qur\u2019an 55:29).\n\nThe Otaru then stressed, \u201cAll the recipients of today, must learn to be mindful of what they do or say at all times, as worthy representatives of the Auchi palace.\n\nThe Otaru stressed further, the titles you received today, is not to be used to ride rough shods or oppress others. Saying \u201cto Allah alone ascend all the goodly words, the sincere supplications, the tears of the innocent, and the invocations of the afflicted.\n\nThe tongue that chants, cries out, and mentions His name are usually blessed. And the heart that does all this, finds peace.\n\nTheir souls find rest. Their nerves are relaxed and their intellects becomes sharper. All these virtures are only possible, when we remember Allah, the Exalted.\n\nThe Otaru continued, \u201cAllah is thought of when richness, strength, help, glory and wisdom come to mind. He asked, the attentive audience at the occasion, \u201cwho has the kingdom of this Day? He again gave the answer, \u201cAllah Himself will reply to his question, it is Allah\u2019s the One, the Irresistible! Qur\u2019an 40:16.\n\nThe Otaru then admonished all the recipients, on the need for them to continuously do good to all manner of men and women, saying that doing good to others gives comfort to the heart.\n\nHe stressed, the first person who benefits from any act of charity is the benefactor himself. As he or she sees and feels the changes in themselves and in their manners.\n\nThrough, these acts of charity, they finding peace, by watching a smile form on the lips of another person. He admonished further, whenever one finds himself in difficulties or distress, such a person in spite of the situation at hand, should always endevour to show some acts of kindness to others, who are not as privileged as themselves.\n\nThe Otaru said, giving to the needy, defending the oppressed, feeding the poor, and helping those in distress, the lives of the charity givers become much better.\n\nThe traditional ruler, therefore, urged all the people honoured to always find the time, to visit the sick, as immense happiness usually follows such acts of kindness and charity. As they get blessed from all directions.\n\nThe Otaru then concluded, \u201cAn act of charity is like a perfume, it benefits the user, the seller, and the buyer.\n\nFurthermore, the psychological benefits that one receives from helping others are great. Saying \u201cIf you suffer from depression, an act of charity will have a more potent effect for your sickness than the best of drugs can have.\u201d\n\nIn between his remarks, the Otaru called out a young man, Abdul-Fatai Sule, who was earlier turbaned on that very day as the Ole-se-se (he who does well) of Auchi Scared Kingdom, to give a brief musical interlude and recitation of the Holy Qur\u2019an.\n\nThe young man began his musical rendition with \u201cKurumaja Laya Kuma sa, and progressed rhythmically, until the 90 years old plus Otaru of Auchi, was moved in spirit and soul to step into the dance floor, to the deafening applause of his subjects.",

She was reacting to a directive by the Nigerian Communications Commission that Nigerians will have to submit the International Mobile Equipment Identity of their phones to the commission from July.\n\nAccording to the NCC, the move would enable it \u201cto curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance National Security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices\u201d.\n\nYesufu stated that it is neither wise nor safe for Nigerians to submit their phone identities to the NCC under Pantami.\n\nPantami, who is a member of the President\u2019s parliament from Gombe State, heads the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy in charge of the Nigerian Communications Commission, National Information Technology Development Agency, National Identity Management Commission, Nigerian Postal Service, amongst others.\n\nPantami has become popular of late over his past pro-Taliban and Al-Qaeda comments but the minister claimed he has renounced his radical views. Many Nigerians have since called for his resignation or sacking.\n\nThe Presidency, vindicated him, stating that he made those comments when he was young and na\u00efve.\n\nYesufu noted that it is problematic that Pantami is still in government despite the irritation that greeted his pro-Taliban comments last month.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe minister of communications is a terrorist sympathiser even though he tries to deny it initially but when the overwhelming evidence of what he had done came out, he then said he did it in his younger age. Somebody in his late 30s was not a young person.\n\n\u201cSomebody who has sided with terrorist groups like Boko Haram now at the helm of affairs, I am not going to submit my details in his custody.\n\n\u201cHe is not supposed to be the minister of communications; he ought to have been sacked right now.

He shouldn\u2019t be at the helm of such sensitive ministry.\u201d\n\nIt had earlier been reported that Yesufu said she would not link her SIM card with her National Identification Number.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, Pantami declared that all SIMs that were not registered with valid NINs on the network of telecommunications companies would be blocked.\n\nAfter many deadlines have been issued, the minister stated that the SIM-NIN linkage exercise has been extended till June 30, 2021 but many Nigerians have been reluctant to link their SIM cards with their NIN, citing data privacy.",

          "title": "Reducing governance cost: Whither Oronsaye report?",
          "text": "\u2026It forces FG to borrow ceaselessly \u2013 ICIR, \u2026Cut estacode \u2013 Odinkalu, \u2018\u2026Govt should downsize lawmakers, MDAs\u2019, \u2026 Restructuring the way out \u2013 Expert\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the governments at all levels in the country cannot meet their obligations, and this has been blamed on the present high cost of governance. Worried by the declining fortunes from oil revenue, the administration of the late Musa Yar\u2019Adua found it difficult to meet its obligations. ELEOJO IDACHABA in this report takes a look at the Steve Oronsaye report and wonders if it could be revisited.\n\nAfter his death, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan inherited a heavy burden of which necessity was placed on that administration to devise a way of cutting down running costs with a view to meeting other obligations. This led to the inauguration of a Presidential Committee on Restructuring and Rationalisation of federal government parastatal, commissions and agencies under the chairmanship of a public service technocrat, Steve Orosanye, to prune and abolish certain institutions whose functions appear similar.\n\nAlthough the Committee finished the work and submitted its report, 10 years later, the government is still crying foul on account of the high cost of governance. The 800-page document otherwise known as the Oronsaye report contained far-reaching recommendations that, if implemented, would help to address the high cost of governance in the country. In all, it identified 929 MDAs, parastatal, commissions as well as agencies, but recommended that 38 agencies be abolished and 14 reversed to departments in a ministry.\n\nThe debate\n\nRecently, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said at a policy dialogue on \u2018Corruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) that the government had initiated a number of programmes aimed at cutting the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue.\n\nShe said President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the Salaries and Wages Committee to review the payroll of public servants.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair work together with the Head of Service of the Federation and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost.\u201d\n\nAhmed said the measures were aimed at reducing recurrent expenditure, projected to gulp N5.6 trillion, about 41.5 per cent of the N13.5 trillion budgeted by the government for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nShe had during the 2020-2022 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) revealed that there would be a spike in personnel cost (including pensions cost) from N2.45 trillion in 2019 to over N3.4 trillion in 2020 due to the Nigerian government\u2019s decision to create five new ministries.\n\nAs at the time she was speaking, it was reported that the additional personnel cost arising from the creation of the new ministries was not factored in the implementation of the New Minimum Wage.\n\nThe development prompted a series of reactions from stakeholders who blamed the government for what they called its ineptitude towards reducing the cost of governance, but has resorted to borrowing and anytime loan facilities are not available, they said the Buhari administration would contemplate downsizing the workforce or rationalise salary payments.\n\nPDP\u2019s take\n\nIn its reaction, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a statement by its publicity secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan, described stated that it was wicked and completely unacceptable that the ruling party would rather choose to go after workers\u2019 salaries even after APC had already increased the heavy burden it placed on Nigerians through the high cost of fuel, electricity, food and other essential commodities that have gone far beyond the reach of many Nigerians.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cRather than impose more hardship on our workers, the APC and its administration should realign the budget by removing their padded figures as well as end the exposed looting in the integrated payment system where trillions of naira are being siphoned through non-existent workers and overheads.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the APC and its administration should return the over N15 trillion stolen from various agencies of the government and channel the same to governance.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s response\n\nOn its part, the APC speaking through its national secretary, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), John Akpanudoedehe, said the federal government has no plans to slash salaries of civil servants as alleged by PDP.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe PDP is up to its comical tales on what it terms intelligence at its disposal to slash the salaries of workers in the country; clearly only the PDP believes its tales. We are proud of our credentials as a truly progressive and people-centred political party.\u201d\n\nWhile all of these were going on, the Kaduna state government fired over 4,000 employees on its payroll on the grounds that it can no longer pay the New Minimum Wage and this development led to the ongoing strike in the state. Also, Imo, Ekiti and other state governments have since indicated that they can no longer pay the New Minimum Wage.\n\nThe ICIR view\n\nIn its take, the International Centre for Investigative Report (ICIR) noted that, \u201cHigh cost of governance is forcing the Nigerian government into borrowing money to finance budget deficits and also to fund capital projects. But the cost of servicing the loans has taken a huge toll on the economy.\u201d\n\nICIR noted that despite the dwindling revenue challenges, political office holders are still among the highest paid in the world. For instance, the president and his deputy earn N3.5 million and N3.03 million respectively as basic salaries, per annum, according to available records from the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\nAlso, the annual basic salary of a minister is put at N2.02 million; minister of state, N1.95 million; special adviser, N1.94 million; governor, N2.22 million; deputy governor, N2.11 million; and commissioner, N1.33 million.\n\nIn addition to the basic salary, the president is entitled to allowances such as hardship allowance \u2013 50 per cent of his salary, about N1.757 million, and consistency allowance \u2013 250 per cent of his salary, which is about N8.79 million.\n\nThe president\u2019s gratuity, it noted, is 300 per cent of his salary, amounting to N10, 544,115 and he is also entitled to a leave allowance of 10 per cent of his salary as well as a vehicle loan which amounts to 400 per cent of basic salary. This also applies to the vice president, lawmakers and other senior public servants.\n\nExperts\u2019 take\n\nReacting, Barrister Edward Omaga, a human rights lawyer, anti-corruption crusader and chairman, Board of Trustees/president of Global Integrity Crusade Network (GICN), said \u201crestructuring the country is the only panacea to reducing cost of governance.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ongoing debate about how best Nigeria can considerably reduce the cost of governance is timely and justifiable. It is however important to point out that the economy is crumbling and certain drastic measures must be adopted by those in authority to salvage the situation.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, restructuring is the answer to our hydra-headed economic challenges at the moment. We hear recently that Kaduna is on a collision course with labour over sacked workers because the governor claimed that he no longer pays salaries. The story is the same in other states like Benue, Ekiti and Imo who have piles of unpaid salaries and pensions. While this is happening to poor civil servants, it is rather surprising to note that heads of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) and politicians continue to take jumbo salaries and allowances which, to say the least, are outrageous. One then begins to wonder where lies the justification for failing to pay workers.\n\n\u201cMy position on how best to reduce the cost of governance is clear and simple. It is high time the president on whom lays enormous powers under the 1999 Constitution (as amended) take positive steps to implement the excellently drafted Steve Oronsaye report.\n\n\u201cAs it is, nothing stops Mr. President from coming up with an Executive Order for implementation of the Oronsaye report. Our Coalition of Civil Society Organisations had written to him before now on this same matter, but no action was taken. When I talk about restructuring, I mean changes in fiscal policies, not creation of more states or regions. I can authoritatively say that the solutions to our national malaise and challenges are with our leaders, but they have failed to tackle them headlong in order to protect their primordial interests.\u201d\n\nPolitical will\n\nOn his part, a public affairs analyst and executive director, OJA Consult, Jide Ojo, noted that there is simply lack of political will on the part of the Buhari administration to save the cost of running the government.\n\n\u201cA lot of things are done that may be politically expedient but economically suicidal. For instance, why did President Muhammadu Buhari increase the number of his ministers from about 37 in his first tenure (2015 \u2013 2019) to 43 members in his second tenure? Why has he not deemed it fit to reduce the number of aircrafts in his Presidential Air Fleet from the current six or thereabout to just two or three?\u201d\n\nHe said all the trillions of unremitted revenues by the government-owned enterprises should have warranted stiff punishments.\n\n\u201cThe Auditor General Report of 2017 which indicted several heads of ministries, departments and agencies should have warranted stiff penalties. The country shouldn\u2019t be witnessing budget padding, the kind of which BudgIT revealed about the 2021 budget where an estimated 316 duplicated items in the budget amounting to over N39 billion was found.\n\n\u201cI learnt the president had asked the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the Head of Civil Service of the Federation to implement the White Paper on the Oronsaye report since April 2020; ironically more than a year after, nothing has been done. In any event, I have issues with the report which is that only about 10 per cent of the recommendations were approved for implementation. Aside from that, since 10 years now when that report was first submitted several other ministries, agencies and departments have been created and still being created. That report should have been updated and thereafter promptly implemented.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, he said, \u201cThere is a need for the president to sponsor an executive bill for amendment of the Constitution. Section 147 (3) which asks the president to appoint at least an indigene of a state as a minister should have been amended to ensure that we have only two ministers per geo-political zones. After all, the United States of America with over 300 million population has only 15 secretaries equivalent to our own ministers. We can also tinker with the Constitution to reduce the number of senators representing each state to two instead of three. We should also reduce the number of members of the House of Representatives from 360 to 240. Also, the state assembly should have only a member representing each local government instead of the current arrangement.\u201d\n\nEx-rights commission\u2019s boss\u2019 reaction\n\nIn his reaction, a professor of Law and former chairman, National Human Rights Commission, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, \u201cLife in high level political leadership is really about Arithmetic and calculus. This administration failed woefully as if ill-equipped for leadership.\n\nPresident Buhari should have known that the cost of governance was unsustainable when he emerged in 2015, and with the political will he had then, he should have set about re-shaping governance as a priority.\n\n\u201cThe groundwork was already laid before he came, but instead, he saw governance as sadaka for his inner coterie and vengeance against the people he defined as \u20185%.\u2019 As a result, instead of fiscal consolidation, we had a snowballing of the cost of governance and of corruption too.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s debt to GDP ratio has risen by about 12 percentage points in two years. The profile doesn\u2019t look good. We are in sovereign insolvency territory. It was just a matter of getting on with the Oronsaye report which had the recommendations. Buhari had the political will in 2015 to implement it, now he no longer has it.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, laying off workers doesn\u2019t necessarily raise revenue; instead, it costs the government revenue in taxes because for most states, the only assured tax is PAYE which comes back to the government.\n\nOn the way out of the development, he said, \u201cThe biggest line item in most budgets is travel; this is because most establishments use estacode to supplement salaries. People get paid for trips not made and there are no reports or deliverables either. So, cutting down travel and estacode would be more sensible.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has accused his counterparts of not giving him the support he deserved in his face-off with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nLabour union had crippled economic activities in Kaduna over what they described as anti-people policies of El-Rufai.\n\nIn the warning strike called off on day three, protesters trooped to the streets, calling on the governor to reverse the sack of 4,000 workers.\n\nThe Progressives Governors Forum advised El-Rufai and labour leaders to return to the negotiation table and stop flexing muscles.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for muscle flexing. Nigerians are already overstretched with many challenges. At this critical point of our democratic journey, there cannot be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens. Every step must be therefore taken to resolve the current face-off between Kaduna state government and NLC. We appeal to both the State Government and NLC to return to the negotiating table,\u201d Kebbi state Governor and PGF Chairman Atiku Bagudu had said.\n\nBut at a virtual meeting of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), El-Rufai criticised the NGF, saying the press release was not helpful.\n\n\u201cThat press release with the greatest respect was unhelpful. It was unhelpful, it said nothing, it was trying to play both sides. I am a governor, I am one of you, the least I expect from the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum is unequivocal and unqualified support. I didn\u2019t see that in that statement. I am being very blunt; I could pretend and be political and just smile and say it was alright but it is not. But I am used to fighting my own battles.\n\n\u201cWe are not running a unitary system, we are a federation. We are elected to govern different states, we owe our people accountability not the NLC, we should take a common stand,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai also insinuated that there was a conspiracy against the Kaduna state government.\n\n\u201cIf it is about rights of workers Kaduna is not the only state that has retrenched workers, Kaduna is not a state owing salaries, Kaduna is not a state failing to pay minimum wage, Kaduna is not a state owing years of pension arrears. Why didn\u2019t they go there? Kaduna was targeted for political reasons, and they are being financed by certain political interests.\n\n\u201cBut we will fight them, we will defeat them but as the governor of Bayelsa said, and since he has brought that subject, I have a responsibility to put it through, unless we collectively address this monster, it will consume all of us.\n\n\u201cAfter this, they will never come back to Kaduna, they will never come back, you will see. They will go to other states, it\u2019s up to the forum to decide on what to do, but we are here, we are ready, we will end this by the grace of God,\u201d he said.\n\nFG sets up c\u2019ttee\n\nMeanwhile, the meeting at the instance of Minister of Labour and Employment Dr Chris Ngige to resolve the industrial disputes between labour and the Kaduna state government have agreed to set up a 10-member committee.\n\nThe committee, according to a Memorandum of Understanding , resolved that membership include Head of Civil Service of Kaduna State as Chairman and five other representatives from the state government and three representative of the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that all the listed issues fall within the ambit of redundancy therefore, it was resolved that the principle of redundancy as stated in section 20 of Labour Act, Cap L 1 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) should apply.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also recognized that the current impasse was caused by communication gap between the State Government and NLC occasioned by both the local chapter and even the Kaduna State Government Officials.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, the meeting resolved to constitute a ten (10) man Bi-partite Committee comprising six (6) representatives of State Government and three (3) officials of the NLC to engage further with the objective of reverting with a work plan on how to integrate the provision of section 20 of the Labour Act CAP L1 LFN 2004 to resolve the impasse between the State Government and the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also resolved that the Committee should have as Chairman, the Head of Service of the Kaduna State Government and assisted by a Deputy National President of the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is expected to revert with the work plan for peaceful resolution of all issues in contention to the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment by Tuesday, 25th May, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe work plan is to itemize the structure and sub-structure in the State and Local Government of their activities, time of commencement and envisaged final tenure of the Committee or make recommendations if in its wisdom it thinks the Committee should be a Permanent Standing Committee.\n\n\u201d In conclusion, it was agreed that there shall be no further industrial action on these issues and no worker shall be victimised on account of his or her participation in the industrial action,\u201d the MoU stated.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Former Head of State and elder statesman, Gen. Yakubu Gowon , has urged the Citizenship and Leadership Training Center CLTC to strengthen its synergy with the National Youth Service Corps NYSC for the growth of our youth and nation.\n\nSaid this while delivering his good will message via zoom during the 70th anniversary of the CLTC yesterday in Abuja.\n\nThe retired general noted that the NYSC has been a platform for human development since its inception, hence the need for a more strengthened collaboration from the CLTC, being a Centre under the ministry of Youth and Sports Development.\n\nHe thanked the CLTC for 70 years of commitment to bettering the lives of the youth and instilling core ethics and leadership values.\n\nAccording to him, \u201c The youth service Corp has been serving the nation so predictably in all areas of human development and service since its inception in 1973.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for these two citizenship and leadership training schemes to work in synergy for the growth of our youth and nation.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, represented by Nebeolisa Anako, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, during a keynote speech, gave insight on the history of CLTC which he said was established as the \u201cMan O War Bay\u201d before the modification in 1989.\n\nHe further spoke on the several values and mandates of the CLTC and thanked the Centre for not lagging in delivering its mandates and core responsibilities.\n\nThe Minister stated that technology has caused Nigeria and the world at large, tremendous economic change and demolishing old boundaries. He however, decried the decline in morals, citizenship and leadership values the advent of technology has caused.\n\nIn his analysis of the national ethics, he mentioned that the attainment of peace is key for development. Reason why he believes in deployment of the national ethics as instruments for settling conflicts so they don\u2019t degenerate to chaos.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs you may already know, the centre was established as the \u2018\u2019Man O War Bay\u2019\u2019 training centre in 1957 and located in Victoria, Southern Cameroon before Nigeria attained independence. It was given a legal status by an Ordinance published in the extra-ordinary Gazette NO 45 of 10th August, 1960 and modified by Decree NO38 of December, 1989 which changed the Name of the Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre.\n\n\u201cThe law that established the Centre saddled it with the responsibility to provide strategic training to Nigerians on morals, ethics, values, self-confidence, self-reliance, good citizenship and responsible leadership as well as other social related challenges of the society.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that Technology is sweeping through the world, Nigeria inclusive, demolishing old boundaries and simplifying processes thereby expanding opportunities for economic growth and prosperity. However decline in morals, ethics, character and citizenship values present a real and potent threat to the attainment of these potentials with its attendant\u2019s negative effect on peace and nation building.\n\n\u201cSection 23 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended dwells on the national ethics to include Discipline, Integrity, Dignity of Labour, Social justice, Religion Tolerance, Self-reliance and Patriotism. A deeper analysis of these national ethics indicates that citizens imbibing and internalising these ethics is an indispensable roadmap for the attainment and sustenance of peace which itself is a panacea for development.\n\n\u201cLet me quickly mention here that peace is not necessarily the absence of conflicts but has to do with the instruments put in place to manage conflicts so that it does not degenerate into chaos and restiveness.\n\n\u201cThis is where Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre comes in. The Centre is a unique establishment which by its mandate plays an important role in the creation of awareness as it relates to the promotion and sustenance of pace and peaceful co-existence in the society.\u201d",

          "title": "Amaechi tasks Oyo State Government on Inland Dry Port partnership with FG",
          "text": "Minister of transportation, Rt Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi has urged Oyo State government to participate in putting infrastructures in place for the Inland Dry Port in Ibadan and access roads to service the dry port and the train station in Moniya or relinquish the project to another state on the route.\n\nAmaechi stated this in a meeting with the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde at the government house, Ibadan on the sidelines of his visit to the Inland dry port site.\n\nAmaechi outlined the issues hampering the construction and explained that if the issues are not fixed now for construction to commence, the pressure on Ibadan will be too much to handle when movement of cargoes from Apapa to Ibadan begins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to inspect the inland dry port and to make sure that Ibadan is ready before the commissioning of the Lagos-Ibadan rail line. There are issues of border, we had acquired the land, gotten CofO when the former Governor was here, now they are denying us entry into the land. We had 90 acres of land, now we have access to only 40.\n\nIn building the Inland Dry Port, \u201cpart of the regulation is, when the government acquires land and gives to the federal government, the state government will provide infrastructure. If we convert that infrastructure to equity, then Kaduna will be the first to ask us for equity, because they were the first to provide those infrastructures in Kaduna Dry Port. So many State governments have given us land to build inland dry port and Oyo State will not be an exception. And we don\u2019t expect that Oyo State will ask us to convert those constructions into equity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to crash Ibadan town, you need to build a road to link Moniya to the old Ibadan/Oyo road. The reason is, the moment we start trucking cargoes from Lagos to Moniya, even if the dry port was not there, you\u2019ll have pressure in your city if there is no road to get them to exit from there.\n\n\u201cSo if you don\u2019t want pressure in your city and on your infrastructure, because what we have today in Lagos, Apapa gridlock and others will transfer to this place; there will be gridlock here. If you don\u2019t want the gridlock, we need to start preparing now, because in June the President will commission Lagos Ibadan rail line. And when he commissions it, it\u2019s our intention to begin to move cargoes on that track, and those cargoes that are going to Kano, Port Harcourt and other states may end up in Ibadan.\n\n\u201cThere are benefits, economic activities will pickup in Ibadan just like in Lagos. So it is good we construct that link road between Moniya or the Inland dry port to Ibadan/Oyo road, there\u2019s a train bridge at the entrance and exit of the Inland dry port with a length of 32 metres, width of 18 metres, the connection of 33kva power supply, the reconstruction of Oyo/Ibadan to Moniya/Iseyin link road and a 15% equity participation by the Oyo state government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe minister said if Oyo State government is not ready, the project will be transferred to another state on the Lagos-Ibadan rail route.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Ogun State has put so much pressure on me, including asking me to build one or give them approval for one in Abeokuta, and I said no, because if I give you approval for one, if it doesn\u2019t kill the one in Ibadan, it will limit the ability of that one to function.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey (Nigeria Shippers Council and the contractors) have suggested a way out. They want the borderline layout, the infrastructure, and the money for your equity participation. As soon as we get this, we go to cabinet, and as soon as we get cabinet approval, then construction will start. So if the Oyo state government is not interested, let\u2019s know now, so we don\u2019t have to go to cabinet, we\u2019ll start fresh negotiations with another state on the line between Lagos and Ibadan.\n\n\u201cThe one of Kaduna, they did not contribute and did not ask for equity, so they don\u2019t have equity, but here if you want 15% equity participation, then you must contribute and it means that you want to share in the profit and the running of the business, so it depends on what you want,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nResponding, the Governor, Seyi Makinde, expressed the State\u2019s interest to participate in the project and begged the Minister not to move the project to Ogun State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said, \u201cmost of the challenges mentioned, there\u2019s non that cannot be resolved. We have completely reconstructed the Moniya to Iseyin road. We want the dry port to be able and ready to handle the headache from Apapa. You have my commitment and that of the state government to participate in this. Please don\u2019t negotiate with Ogun. We want you to partner with us on this and we\u2019ll do everything to make sure the issues are resolved quickly.\u201d",

Israeli police, it adds, subsequently \u201craided the courtyards and started firing rubber-coated rounds and tear-gas at the worshippers\u201d.\n\nAt least 15 people were hit by rubber-coated rounds, while many others were affected by tear gas or were beaten by officers, according to Wafa.\n\nClashes between protesters and police there earlier this month were one of the main triggers for the war.\n\nEarlier thousands took to the streets of Gaza as a cease-fire took hold at 2 a.m.\n\nYoung men waved Palestinian and Hamas flags, passed out sweets, honked horns and set off fireworks.\n\nCelebrations also broke out overnight in east Jerusalem and across the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael captured all three territories in the 1967 war and the Palestinians want them for their future state.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross has confirmed that the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza has been re-opened.\n\nLocal media reports had previously conflicted about whether the major corridor into Gaza was letting traffic through. But the ICRC said it had used the crossing \u2013 located on the borders of Israel, Gaza and Egypt \u2013 to ferry medical supplies and equipment to Palestinians in the territory.",

          "text": "Japan has expanded a coronavirus state of emergency hours in an effort to contain a worrying surge in infections nine weeks ahead of the opening of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no forced lockdown, the state of emergency allows prefectural governors to demand that shops and public establishments close or shorten their hours. It has expanded from the hotspots of Osaka and Tokyo in late April to other regions earlier this month, currently covering 42% of Japan\u2019s population.\n\nOn Friday, the government announced a decision to add Okinawa, a southern archipelago that hosts most of the US military forces stationed in Japan, starting Sunday.\n\nAs the government pushes to host the Olympics in July, virus containment is essential to warding off mounting public worry about the safety of the event. Recent polls have found that more than 80% of Japanese oppose hosting the Summer Games.\n\nEarlier Friday, Japan approved the production and use of Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said the two vaccines will help speed up inoculations. Japan has administered one or more vaccine doses to roughly 5 million people, or just 4% of the population, using the Pfizer shots that were approved in February.\n\nA quicker vaccine rollout is seen as key to Japan\u2019s ability to contain a worsening spread of the coronavirus. More than half of Japan\u2019s roughly 12,000 COVID-19 deaths have happened since February. The number of COVID-19 patients in serious condition hit a record high this week.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to finish vaccinating the country\u2019s roughly 36 million elderly population by the end of July, when the Games are to be held. However, a government survey of 1,741 municipalities released last week found around 15% will not be able to meet the deadline.\n\nFollowing local vaccine rollouts at cities and towns across the country, the government on Monday will open mass-vaccination sites in two of the country\u2019s biggest metropolitan areas, Tokyo and Osaka, with the goal of administering the shots to up to 15,000 elderly people a day. The sites will use the Moderna shots.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccines will not be distributed to public vaccination sites anytime soon, the health ministry said upon approval. Because of reports of rare blood clots, the regulatory body will continue to examine the risks and usage guidelines.",

Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd). who presented Nigeria\u2019s positions on items 6C and 7 at the meeting, stated that while nations deepen cooperation and strengthen the processes of combating the financing of terrorism and prevention of terrorists from benefitting from ransom payments, it is also important for them not to overlook the trafficking in illicit drugs.\n\nMarwa said: \u201cIt is also imperative to keep an eye on, and control the proliferation of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and other substances of abuse that serve as conflict multipliers leading to escalation of both the scope and intensity of violent activities.\n\n\u201cNigeria is also worried about the existing and growing links between terrorism and other forms of crime such as corruption, illicit financial flows, money laundering, illicit trafficking in drugs, cybercrime, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.\u201d\n\nThe anti-drug czar said: \u201cWe, therefore, call on states to strengthen international cooperation to combat these links by providing information, intelligence sharing, mutual legal assistance, logistics support and military cooperation and other forms of technical assistance to enhance the capacity of security personnel to combat this new and ugly phenomenon.\u201d\n\nMarwa, while delivering Nigeria\u2019s statement on item 6C on Wednesday at the conference, said as nations renew their desire to improve international cooperation to address all forms of crimes, \u201cNigeria urges all states, once again, to make sincere efforts, to address the root causes, which include; poverty, economic deprivation, inequality, drug abuse, and other socio-economic factors. These factors have been found to be indirectly responsible for the increasing incidences of terrorism and other forms of crimes.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA chief executive, while also presenting the country\u2019s statement on Item 7 on Thursday, disclosed that: \u201cNigeria notes with great concern the incidence of illicit financial flows, which go through the financial systems annually, particularly from developing to developed economies. To dissuade the perpetrators of this anomaly including financial institutions who act as enablers, state parties should ensure that illicit financial flows, when tracked, do not remain in the custody of enabling financial institutions but should be transferred into escrow account, preferably in development banks pending return to countries of origin.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, we call for the implementation of the recommendations of the FACTI Panel in support of asset recovery and the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
