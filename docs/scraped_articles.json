          "text": "Protesters at Dowen College\n\n\u2026Says Nigeria now riskiest country\n\nLAGOS\u2014THE pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, yesterday, described the killing of Sylvester Oromoni, the 12-year-old student of Dowen College, Lekki, allegedly beaten to death by some of his mates and the rampage at a secondary school in Edo State as ugly signs of how governments in Nigeria have failed the people.\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said the manner in which adolescents die in Nigeria and the increasing banditry among children in schools are \u201cclear indications that the country\u2019s present has not only been jeopardized, its future has also been imperiled.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Police arrest man with fresh human parts in Ikorodu\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIn this respect, both the federal and the state governments are culpable. We have not mentioned the local governments because the state governments have totally emasculated that tier of governance in flagrant violation of the Constitution and democratic ethos which those running governments at federal and states sworn to protect.\n\n\u201cCases of such unruly behavior are now very rampart in the country. These are in addition to the banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and terrorism occurring in different parts on Nigeria. Situations that have made the country one of the riskiest to live in across the globe.\n\n\u201cThe collapse of discipline and orderliness in our schools is reflective of the collapse of these virtues in the larger society. Until very recently, every adult in the society was respected by the young ones while teachers were revered very highly. No student would think of ambushing a teacher not to talk of having the temerity to attack teachers in the school as happened in the Edo and Delta States cases. But they now do such with impunity having observed the adults behaving unruly in the open society.\n\n\u201cThese incidents speak of how those governing the country have failed woefully and how our moral values have been debased. Youngsters and students took to cultism and banditry after taking drugs that government agencies failed to prevent them from having access to. These young ones also delve into this immoral acts having observed same in the adults.\n\n\u201cGone were the days when those, in position of leadership, were epitomes of good conduct and commitment to established procedures. For instance, had LATSMA officers obeyed the rule of engagement which forbids them from chasing a driver that violates the law, the lives of the 15 innocent students would not have been lost as happened when the said driver was running away from LATSMA officers on Ikorodu road last week. The rule of engagement was that if a driver could not be apprehended, the number of plate of his vehicle be noted for apprehension at a later time \u2013 and perhaps by other means that are legitimate.\n\n\u201cWhat the LATSMA officers did was symptomatic of how Nigerian governments ambush the citizens, and still go ahead to punish these citizens who try to disentangle themselves.\n\n\u201cThe incidents leading to the loss of lives of students and unruliness in schools should be an opportunity for more commitment by government and other stakeholders to sanitize our education system, bring back the inspection officials, allow more democratic practices in terms of greater involvement of communities in the running of schools and above all, show personal discipline by following laid-down procedures and obeying the rule of law faithfully.\n\n\u201cState governments should remove their stranglehold on local governments so that the third tier can, along with the communities they serve, pay more attention to the educational institutions in their respective areas. Parents and guardians too should be more alive to their responsibility as their failure at home is reflecting on undisciplined behavior of their children.\u201d",

          "text": "By Oyebola Owolabi, Moses Emorinken, Abuja and Alao Abiodun\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has shelved the proposed peace walk billed for this month.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in his last address on Tuesday, invited some known faces of the #EndSARS protest in the state in October 2020 to a peace walk for \u201cthe healing of Lagos\u201d.\n\nStudents of the Lagos State University, clerics, other groups expressed solidarity to join the Walk of Peace.\n\nBut, in a statement yesterday, Sanwo-Olu clarified that the walk has been suspended due to the emerging COVID-19 variants, especially the Omicron variant.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cSince my last address to you, the good people of Lagos State on Tuesday 30, November 2021, during which I expressed a desire to lead a Walk for Peace, following the outcome of the work of the Judicial Panel on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters, I have been inundated with deep expressions of solidarity from various groups and people declaring their readiness to join me on the symbolic walk.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I owe a special debt of gratitude to our youths and students, who reached out to either members of my team or directly to me, expressing their readiness to join me on the planned Walk for Peace.\n\n\u201cThey include many of our civil society leaders, business leaders within and outside of Corporate Lagos, religious leaders, members of the diplomatic community, entertainers, market associations, trade associations and women groups, who have committed time and resources to prepare for the peace walk. I thank you all.\n\n\u201cWhen the unseen enemy called Covid-19 began to ravage the world and indeed our nation, I assumed the role of the Incident Commander in our quest to protect the lives of our people. We subjected ourselves to the dictates of science. We chose to be guided not by our emotions, but expert opinions rooted in science.\n\n\u201cBetween Tuesday 30, November 2021, that I made my address and now, we have seen a significant rise in cases associated with the Omicron variant of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cGiven this development, I am constrained to stand down all preparations for the Walk for Peace. I will not endanger the life of any Lagosian in my sincere search for peace.\n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support the initiative received from far and near. The deluge of support is, however, indicative of one thing: our people know the strategic place of peace to our quest for development.\n\n\u201cI look forward to engaging with you as, \u2018We together work for peace!\u2019\u201d\n\nLCCI advises Fed Govt against imposing lockdown\n\nIn the face of the Omnicron variant, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has advised that the imposition of lockdown as a measure to contain and manage the spread of the coronavirus should be avoided at all costs.\n\nLCCI President, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, gave the advice at a news conference yesterday in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhile we celebrate the positive Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth recorded all through the three quarters of this year, the recovery of the economy from the impact of COVID-19 in 2020 is still fragile.\n\n\u201cGovernment must do everything in its power to sustain the positive growth trajectory towards an inclusive and sustainable growth rate.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a long-term containment strategy and public health action plan to manage epidemics and pandemics without having to lock down the economy,\u201d he said\n\nOlawale-Cole said that scientists, epidemiologists and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had recommended vaccination as the most potent protection against the COVID-19 virus.\n\nHe, however, noted that developing countries, unfortunately, suffered from a lack of access to vaccines and a weak pharmaceutical manufacturing base.\n\n\u201cWe are obviously lagging behind our peers,\u201d the LCCI President said.\n\nHe urged the government to take the pandemic as an opportunity to make sustainable changes and improvements in the Nigerian healthcare sector.\n\nAccording to him, it is a pathway to accelerating progress toward the achievement of Universal Health Coverage.\n\nOlawale-Cole proposed in the short term that the government develop and deploy strategies, addressing the supply and demand side of vaccination to get more citizens vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) needs to conduct quick studies on the new variant and advise the government on the next steps of containment.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to clamp down on any existing vaccine card racketeers who issue fake vaccination cards to outbound travellers from Nigeria to developed countries.\u201d\n\nVaccine booster jabs begin today\n\nThe Federal Government will today begin the administration of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to protect Nigerians from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, especially the new Omicron variant.\n\nIt noted that only fully vaccinated Nigerians with a six-month interval between their last vaccinations will be eligible to get the booster doses.\n\nFurthermore, it added that as of yesterday, 7,361,810 Nigerians have received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, representing 6.6 per cent of the eligible population, while 3,846,762 eligible Nigerians have received their second doses and are fully vaccinated against the virus, representing 3.4 per cent of the eligible population.\n\nThe Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, stated this during the Flag-off of COVID-19 mass vaccination of refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the detection of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the Federal Government reviewed the country\u2019s vaccination programme and resolved to introduce the booster dose using the Pfizer Bio-N-Tech vaccine across the country. This will take effect from tomorrow, Friday the 10th of December 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to reiterate the fact that the Nigerian COVID-19 vaccination programme is science-driven. Evidence has shown that the booster dose further increases protection against the virus. Eligibility for the booster dose includes being 18 years and above, fully vaccinated with either two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or a single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The time interval before the booster dose is at least six months for these vaccines, except the Johnson and Johnson which is at least two months.\n\n\u201cThis is another opportunity to be further protected. I, therefore, urge all those who have taken the right decision to be fully vaccinated, to walk into the nearest vaccination site for their booster dose as from tomorrow.\u201d\n\nU.S. donates 2.5m doses of Pfizer shots to Nigeria\n\nThe United States has announced the donation of 2.5 million Pfizer vaccine doses to Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the U.S. Embassy said the vaccine doses arrived in Abuja this week and were received by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and taken to cold storage in preparation for distribution.\n\nThe vaccines are planned to be distributed to over 3,000 health facilities across the 36 states and FCT-Abuja.\n\nThe statement added that the vaccines in the next few weeks will be available across major locations for vaccination in the country.\n\n\u201cOver the next several weeks, the vaccines will be available at major markets, shopping malls, event centres, motor parks, airports, places of employment and religious institutions as part of Nigeria\u2019s mass vaccination campaign.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that the United States has donated more than 13.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with COVAX, or bilaterally to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the United States has provided more than $119 million in COVID-19 related health assistance,\u201d it added.\n\nThe COVID-19 related health assistance, according to the U.S Embassy, includes a 40-bed mobile field hospital, ventilators and related training for 88 hospitals, personal protective equipment, technical assistance for vaccine readiness, risk communication and demand generation for vaccines.\n\nOthers include \u201cconducting an epidemiological COVID-19 detection and vaccine hesitancy survey, setting up electronic record systems, rapid response teams, training for over 200,000 military and civilian personnel on COVID-19 control measures, and technology for virtual training\u201d.\n\nUNICEF: pandemic is worst crisis for children in 75 years history\n\nCOVID-19 is the worst crisis the United Nations Children\u2019s Agency (UNICEF) has seen in its 75 years history, the agency said in a report released yesterday.\n\nUNICEF said COVID-19 was challenging decades of progress on key childhood challenges, including poverty, access to education, nutrition and mental well-being.\n\nUNICEF Executive Director, Henrietta Fore, said the widespread impact of COVID-19 continues to deepen, increasing poverty, entrenching inequality and threatening the rights of children.\n\n\u201cWhile the number of children who are hungry, out of school, abused, living in poverty or forced into marriage is going up, the number of children with access to health care, vaccines, sufficient food and essential services is going down.\n\n\u201cIn a year in which we should be looking forward, we are going backwards.\u201d\n\nThe report said 100 million additional children were estimated to now be living in multidimensional poverty because of the pandemic, a 10 per cent increase since 2019.\n\nIn 2020, over 23 million children missed out on essential vaccines, an increase of nearly four million from 2019 and the highest number in 11 years, the report said.\n\nFore said in an era of a global pandemic, growing conflicts, and worsening climate change, never has a child-first approach been more critical than today.",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nSultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, on Thursday, raised the alarm that northern Nigeria is fast turning to killing field by armed bandits and other terrorists operating in the region.\n\nThe Sultan who indicated that the bandits are holding the region spellbound especially northwest, and was particularly concerned that most of the killings are not reported or underreported.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe Sultan who spoke in Abuja, at the opening ceremony of the fourth quarterly meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), with the theme \u2018NIREC, Security Agencies and Peace in Nigeria\u2019 accused elites of being responsible for the unending security challenges in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to sit down and talk about ourselves. We need to come up with possible solutions to the problems of Nigeria, particularly as regards rising insecurity. In this room, we are the minority, we are the elites and the elites are the problems of this country because we always want things to go our way\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Sultan lamented that terrorists unleash terror on communities and kill people on a daily basis in north \u201cfreely\u201d, and should be stopped forthwith.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvidently, Nigeria is faced with series of challenges, and if leaders doesn\u2019t wake up, come together to understand the issues facing the country, the challenges might escalate and possibly consume all.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not deceive ourselves, everything is not alright in our country, and I have spoken about repeatedly in different fora. To know that you have a problem means you have part of the solution. The earlier we rise to the occasion, come together, the better for us.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan reminded some religious leaders of the enormous respect, loyalty and followership they command, hence they should guide their utterances and actions particularly towards their followers to avoid unnecessary bitterness and incitement.\n\n\u201cWe have to be careful in the way we handle, say and do things as religious leaders. We are not political leaders, and therefore, we have to be weary of what we say, where and how we say such things, because our followers will definitely believe in what we say and feel that it is from the Holy Koran or the Holy Bible.\u201d\n\nThe President, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. Samson Ayokunle Olasupo, in his remarks, complained about the activities of kidnappers and other criminals on Nigerian roads.\n\n\u201cTravelling on Nigerian roads has become a very great risk now. Kidnapper are everywhere and they don\u2019t only come out to kidnap but also to kill. So, you don\u2019t know who the next victim is going to be.\n\n\u201cWhy should these people be killing and hiding people in our territory without being challenged? Why should it be easy for them to hide people somewhere within the state and the security agencies in the state within few days or weeks will not be able to fish them out?\u201d, he queried.\n\nThe CAN President who is the Co-Chairman of NIREC, thus, advocated intelligence gathering to tackle the challenge.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to volunteer information to the security agencies so that the movement of criminals could be traced and apprehended ahead of time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary of NIREC, Rev. Fr. Cornelius Omonokhua, in his opening remarks, stressed the importance of synergy between Christians and Muslims in the fight against terrorism and insecurity.\n\n\u201cNo terrorist can be a religious person and no religious person can be a terrorist. We must come together now to pray and fight those who have waged war against humanity in Nigeria\u201d, he advised.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Describes ex- Osun gov as man of inflexible integrity he can follow to the jungle\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday reminisced on the failed bid by former Governor Bisi Akande to seek re-election in Osun state in 2003 and laid the blame squarely on the doorstep of then President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nHe also described Akande who served as the pioneer National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as a man of inflexible integrity and a perfect public officer that he could follow to the jungle.\n\nThe President, who spoke in Lagos at the public presentation of \u2018\u2018My Participations,\u201d the autobiography of Chief Bisi Akande, reflected on the political history of the author, particularly his bid to seek a second term as Governor of Osun, and declared: \u201dIt is common knowledge that Akande was the victim \u2013 along with other AD Governors \u2013 of a diabolical double-cross which ended his gubernatorial career. Only the steadfast Asiwaju Bola Tinubu escaped the electoral massacre masterminded by President Obasanjo.\n\n\u201dDesperately disappointed though he was, and being a good Muslim, he accepted this setback as part of the trials of life. He looked to the future of service to the country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also narrated how Akande had risen to prominence from his participation in the Constituent Assembly established by the Military Government of General Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nHis words: \u201cHe was always in the thick of things through the difficulties and political discontinuities of the 1980s and 90s.\n\n\u2018\u2018He emerged as Governor of Osun State in 1999 when the military handed over to the civilians.\n\n\u201dChief Akande had a horrendous baptism as Governor of Osun State with discord from his own party; his State Assembly (including an attempt to impeach him without any reason whatsoever); from the trade unions and from his own deputy Governor!\n\n\u201dOn top of that, he inherited a deeply indebted Treasury, huge arrears of salary, allowances, and pensions. Enough challenges to overwhelm many aspiring leaders.\n\n\u201dBisi Akande stood four square and faced all the challenges head-on and overcame most of them.\n\n\u201dHis first action was to stop payment of \u201ccritical allowances\u201d a euphemism for government money customarily shared by the big boys in Osun State.\n\n\u201dThis set the tone of his Administration,\u201d the President said.\n\nRecounting the achievements of the former Governor of Osun State, President Buhari noted that it was on record that within one year, Akande had paid off all the salary and other arrears, showing his mettle as a competent and serious administrator.\n\n\u201dBy 2003 Chief Akande had virtually sanitised governance in Osun State having cleared some of the troublemakers from his government and, though reluctant to serve a second term, he was persuaded to run again\u201d.\n\nHe further described Akande as a \u201cperfect public officer,\u201d and the type of person he could go into the jungle with adding that the author has retained his \u2018\u2018inflexible integrity,\u201d in and out of public office, never accepting or offering bribes.\n\nPresident Buhari, who heaped praises on the former governor of Osun State, further described him as a decent, truthful, and friendly person as well as an administrator of the first order, whose leadership qualities made him the unanimous choice as the first Chairman of the APC.\n\nHe used the occasion to narrate his first meeting with Akande, his passion for Nigeria, achievements, and disappointment as governor of Osun State as well as his many battles to wrest power from the then ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to him: \u201dMy first personal contact with Chief Akande was, if I recall correctly, in 2006 when preliminary consultations were coming to fruition for a grand coalition to unseat the PDP Government. Those efforts eventually came to nothing.\n\n\u201dNeither he, nor I, nor many of our friends and associates gave up as, in Chief Akande\u2019s words: \u201cthe country was going down and down under PDP\u201d (p.396 of My Participations)\u201d.\n\nReflecting on APC\u2019s ascent to governance at the Federal level in 2015, President Buhari recalled that \u201dChief Akande was in the thick of further attempts in 2011 and 2014 to fuse together different groups and dislodge PDP from governance.\n\n\u201dThe key to his thinking which coincides with mine is that Nigeria can only be successfully managed by alliances between major groups.\n\n\u201dAlthough we failed in 2011 but by persistence and knowledge that PDP was driving the country towards disaster, several major parties were able to finally coalesce into APC in 2014 .\n\n\u201dChief Akande was unanimously chosen as the first Chairman of this great coalition.\n\n\u201dThroughout the difficult negotiations, I found Akande truthful, steady and always with an eye to the ultimate goal.\n\n\u201dIn or out of office, he has retained his inflexible integrity. On p.400 of his book, he wrote: \u2018I never gave to or demanded bribe from anyone all my life.\u2019 A perfect gentleman.

          "text": "\u2022Says warrant of arrest must henceforth be approved by Chief Judges\n\n\u2022Malami commends judiciary for preserving nation\u2019s democracy\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, yesterday issued a strong warning that the judiciary would begin to rise up against what he described as, \u201cclandestine attempt\u201d to silent it in the discharge of its lawful judicial functions.\n\nThe CJN spoke against the recent raid on the residence of the second most senior Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Peter-Odili, by alleged security operatives.\n\nJustice Muhammad who said the judiciary would begin to assert itself so as to become the pride of the nation, stated that the judiciary has had enough of embarrassment of its judicial officers and would no longer take it kindly in the event of any repeat of the ugly treatment to judges from security operatives.\n\nHe spoke in Abuja, during the conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) on 72 lawyers as well as the commencement of the 2021/2022 legal year of the Supreme Court.\n\nThis was just as the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem yesterday disclosed that in its bid to tackle the challenge occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, the court delivered a total sum of 528 judgments, via Zoom, a virtual meeting platform in the immediate past legal year of the court.\n\nAccording to Muhammad, the silence of the judiciary should never be mistaken for stupidity or weakness.\n\n\u201cOn a very sad note, I must say, we were jolted with embarrassingly news of the invasion of the official residence of one of our brother Justices, Hon Justice Mary Peter Odili on Friday October 29 by men suspected to be security operatives, acting on a search warrant.\n\n\u201cThe said warrant was purportedly obtained from an Abuja Magistrate court under questionable circumstances.\n\n\u201cI must make it known to all and sundry that we have had enough dosage of such embarrassment and harassment of our judicial officers across the country and we can no longer take any of such shenanigans.\n\n\u201cThe silence of the judiciary should never be mistaken for stupidity or weakness\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe shall begin to resist any clandestine attempt to silence or ridicule us to oblivion. Nigeria, to the best of my knowledge is not a lawless society. We should begin to do things that will project is favourably and rightly too, to the international community.\n\n\u201cNo law permits anyone to invade, subdue or overawe any Nigerian citizen in his or her residence with a flimsy, fraudulently obtained search warrant,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CJN noted that by the nature of their work, judicial officers are conservative but not conquered species and should not be pushed further by any individual, institution or agency of the government.\n\nHe assured that soon, those taking judiciary as a mere weakling would soon realise that it was, \u201cfrom the calmest seas we often experience the fiercest storms.\u201d\n\nHe therefore stated that, \u201cNo one, irrespective of his or her status or position in the country, should test our will because the consequences of such unwarranted provocation will be too dire to bear.\n\n\u201cWe are making efforts now to ensure that henceforth, every search or arrest warrant must be issued with the knowledge and approval of the Chief Judge of the respective state or Federal High Court as the case may be\u201d.\n\nContinuing, the CJN said the new SANs have, in all ramifications and by all standards, excelled in the practice of law and subsequently conferred with the rank.\n\nHe equally used the opportunity to lament the setback caused by the protracted strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), saying it came with excruciating impact on smooth dispensation of justice.\n\nIn his remarks, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, described the conferment of \u2018SANship\u2019 as a privilege.\n\nMalami who praised the judiciary noted that the arm of government has continued to complement other arms of government in spite of emerging challenges foisted on it by COVID-19, insecurity and dwindling economy, saying the judiciary has helped in the preservation of the country\u2019s hard earned democracy.\n\n\u201cI want to state categorically that the LPPC have done a good job by putting forward deserving and qualifying lawyers, saying they must ensure that due process is followed in subsequent selection,\u201d Malami added.\n\nSpeaking further, Dongban-Mensem further disclosed that the court disposed of 5, 669 cases and 10, 798 motions in the same year.\n\nDongban-Mensem, who spoke at the second working retreat/annual conference of the Court of Appeal and launch of its Rules 2021, said despite a 51 per cent increase in the number of motions filed during the period under review, the court witnessed a 48 per cent increase in the number of motions disposed of by the panels as at November ending this year.\n\nShe further explained that 10 hearings were also held by panels of the Court via Zoom, adding that in the last two months, a further 40 judgments were delivered via Zoom.\n\n\u201cThe administration of justice remains the primary focus of the Court. As I stated during the Legal Year, the Learned Justices of the Court, without exception, have worked incredibly to improve justice delivery this year.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we have had a 26.47 per cent reduction in the total volume of cases pending in our divisions, as compared with last year.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, despite a 51 per cent increase in the number of motions filed, we witnessed a 48 per cent increase in the number of motions disposed of by the panels over the course of this legal year.\n\n\u201cIn the face of incredible uncertainty such as the world has and is still experiencing, I am assured that the Court will rise to each and every challenge that will face us whether jurisprudentially or otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to deepening the expeditious dispensation of justice and are not afraid to think out of the box in order to achieve it.\n\n\u201cThis informs our pivot towards a technology driven system of justice, following the precedent set by the Chief Justice of Nigeria in the technological innovations introduced to the Supreme Court\u201d, she said.\n\nThe president said that the development informed the amendment of the Court\u2019s Rules of Practice in order to properly cater for this digital revolution.\n\nShe stated that the 2021-2022 legal year has begun with much greater confidence following the infusion of 18 new Justices to the Court of Appeal in the course of the year 2021.\n\n\u201cI remarked at the time of their appointment that they were joining a Family Court, which is close knit and fraternal. I can confidently state that my brother justices, when sitting as a panel, are a well-oiled machine.\n\n\u201cIt was therefore important for our new learned brother justices to be properly oriented so as not to disrupt the course of the dispensation of justice.\n\n\u201cHaving cut their teeth in the crucible of Special Panels and their various Stations, I am glad to state that our new Justices have proven their mettle and must be highly commended for their work\u201d, she added.\n\nShe claimed that the court had to hear 198 motions and appeals, which according to her was commendable given that they sat in only six panels hearing an average of 33 matters per panel.\n\nMuhammad, later launched the new Practice Direction of the court with a charge on the Justice not to rest on their oars and to continue to dispense justice without fear or favor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reveals tech companies raised $1.4bn\n\n\u2022Moody: Nigeria\u2019s external reserves to remain strong\n\nNume Ekeghe and Kayode Tokede\n\nAnalysts at Renaissance Capital Limited (RenCap), an international research and financial advisory company have predicted that with the upcoming Basel III policy that requires enhanced capital buffers, some of Nigeria\u2019s tier-2 and tier-3 banks might opt for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in order to strengthen their capital positions.\n\nThe firm also forecasted in order to enhance economic recovery in the country and effectively manage inflation, the Monetary policy committee (MPC) might hike its rate by one percentage point next year.\n\nThe Acting Chief Executive Officer, Renaissance Capital, Mr. Samuel Sule and the company\u2019s Director, Frontier/ Sub-Saharan Africa Banks and Fintech, Mr. Adesoji Solanke made the predictions yesterday, during a virtual media briefing where they discussed, \u2018Wrapping up 2021 and looking out for opportunities in 2022 for Nigeria and its fintech sector.\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the outlook of the banking sector, Solanke said what would drive ratings for Nigerian banking equities would be the central bank\u2019s policy decisions, particularly with respect to the exchange rate and capital controls.\n\nSolanke said: \u201cNigeria remains a significant underweight in the equity portfolio majority of international clients and only those who have capital stock in the country have been participating in the equity markets.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen any meaningful capital being allocated to Nigeria, given the central bank\u2019s capital controls and exchange rate policy over the last one to two years.\n\n\u201cAlso, the naira at the investors and exporters (I&E) window is 13 per cent overvalued, the fair value for the naira of N473 per dollar. The I&E window rates at N482 per dollar by end of 2022 and also, higher transport costs below average harvest and high cost of imported food could all combine to put upside upward pressure on inflation by the next year.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on anticipated M&A, Solanke said: \u201cThere\u2019s room for M&A and we think it would be between tier-two and tier-three banks, because now they\u2019re even much smaller in the grand scheme of things.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Sule said: \u201cContinued growth in digitalisation trends across our markets, with the pandemic having meaningfully fast-tracked digital adoption.\n\n\u201cAs the continent continues to attract more funding, we are excited about what the entrepreneurs will build on the infrastructure layers that are getting built in payments and open banking.\n\n\u201cWe expect this to drive embedded finance which will be a major driver in how fintech companies drive digital solutions as they scale, making almost any tech company a fintech.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Solanke disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s start-ups and tech companies in 2021, raised a total of $4billion in over 750 deals.\n\nHe maintained that Fintech remained the most funded, accounting for well over 50 per cent of the year-to-date (YtD) funds raised, adding that Nigeria remains the most attractive market.\n\nHe highlighted that OPay in 2021 raised $400million Series C, while Wave and Andela\u2019s $200million Series A and E respectively, Flutterwave raised $170million Series C, amongst other companies.\n\nMeanwhile, Moody\u2019s, a global rating agency has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s external reserves would remain strong in 2022, with the expectation that it would be bolstered with the commencement of Dangote Refinery and other fiscal and monetary policies being put in place by the federal government(FG).\n\nVice President/ Senior Credit Officer, Sovereign Risk Group Moody, Mr. Aurelien Mali said this yesterday, during a webinar with the theme: \u201cNigeria: Challenges and Opportunities Arising from the Pandemic.\u201d\n\nAlso at the webinar, Group Chief Financial Officer, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, Mr. Ayo Adepoju urged the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to review the current Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) which is pegged at 27.5 per cent.\n\nSpeaking on Nigeria\u2019s external reserves, Mali said: \u201c We expect the reserve to remain strong. We have a view that growth is going to average 3.5 per cent until 2025, supported also by some key project like the Dangote Refinery.\n\n\u201cSo, the research of the reserves have changed, it was extremely volatile over the last decade and the lowest point was in 2016 when you had the very active militancy in the Niger Delta after the production of oil was stopped.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s say that in 2018 to 2019, most of the big chunk of the increase in the reserves were foreign portfolio and inflows that were very volatile by nature. And so there was a risk that reserve could fall very quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday it is different because the rebound of the oil price that has been supportive and the IMF gave $3.4 billion in March 2020. The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) location of $3.4 billion recently, and the country has been able to access the international market issuing $4 billion recently, you had also the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and therefore the reserves never went down like between 2015-2016 and it even rebounded.\n\n\u201cAnd there is the Petroleum Industrial Act (PIA) which is an important piece of legislation, which which should increase the investment in the oil sector in the future,\u201d he added.\n\nOn what prompted its upgrade of Nigeria\u2019s rating, he said economic reforms and policies of the federal government had positively affected Nigeria\u2019s rating.\n\nOn his part, Adepoju who spoke on the challenges the banking sector was facing, advised that that CRR policy should be reviewed downward.\n\nAdepoju said: \u201cThe cash reserve requirement policy of the central bank is very massive, in terms of the impact on the liquidity in the local market.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the biggest elephant in the room, which is in terms of the cash reserve requirements, the policy is about 27.5 per cent but the proxies of what we\u2019ve seen in the market is that the industry average is well over 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, you see more of the liquidity sitting with the central bank, earning zero per cent. And when you have an industry average of cash reserve requirements over 40 per cent, that is the highest in any part of the globe as most of the markets have cash reserve either at five per cent or 10 per cent, 12 per cent or 13 per cent. \u201cNever would you see cash reserve going to 40 per cent threshold. I understand the perspective of the central bank trying to manage excess liquidity in the market, but at the same time, it is important to ensure that the banking industry has sufficient liquidity to power through growth in the market.\n\n\u201cFor us overall, forex is not a major issue, because it\u2019s far better than where we were two years ago. So, the forex position in the industry has improved, but, of course, there\u2019s still, you know, much room, for expansion, but as long as the players continue to have access to global markets, you know, that should not be a big source of concern.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

This eliminates the need for merchants to integrate with different systems in order to manage sales and revenues.\n\nCinetPay thus simplifies the process of accepting payments. Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region.

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the funding that goes to African startups comes from outside the continent. In 2020, 71% of the money invested in Nigerian startups came from outside the country. It is a similar story in other countries.\n\nIn recent years, however, the number of investors on the continent has increased, and this could be attributed to early startup founders\u2019 successes. Consequently, seeing African investors either lead or make up the majority of investors on a startup\u2019s cap table is fast becoming the norm.\n\nOne of these investors is HAVA\u00cdC, a South Africa-based investment firm. Techpoint Africa had a chat with Ian Lessem, where he explained the firm\u2019s origins and how they make investment decisions. The interview has been reproduced below.\n\nHow did HAVA\u00cdC get started?\n\nSo we started the business about seven or eight years ago, recognising that there was a lot of tech talent coming out of South Africa and places like Kenya and Nigeria, but very little smart capital supporting these businesses. My partners and I, along with the rest of the team, come from what you would call a very traditional investment background, so we\u2019ve worked in investment banks, M&A\u2019s, etc. We know what it takes to scale businesses. We recognised a gap in the market to number one, find these businesses, and help them grow locally and internationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is your investment thesis?\n\nWe invest in early-stage technology companies that solve real-world challenges. So early-stage for us is post-revenue seed up to Series A. Revenue could be pretty small, maybe just one customer. Importantly, we only invest in businesses where we feel we can add value, so typically, we take a strategic role on the board, helping the businesses scale.\n\nNumber two, the businesses need to be tech-enabled and use their platforms to scale locally and internationally. Thirdly, we focus on businesses that solve actual challenges, so we don\u2019t invest in what we call \u2018nice to haves\u2019. An example would be Twitter. Those who invested in the early stages have done very well, but it\u2019s not solving any problems. If you look at our portfolio, we have startups providing financial inclusion. We have many fintech, healthtech, and business productivity companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your average ticket size in these companies?\n\nWe take minority stakes, so we invest from $100,000 to $1,500,000, and we don\u2019t go above 24.9% in the companies. Importantly, we like to invest in businesses where the founders are in control.\n\nBy your standards, what should a startup not be doing?\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019ll say the topical one is a lot of hot money coming in. Some investors don\u2019t have any experience working in Africa and often push the founders to adopt strategies that work elsewhere but not necessarily in Africa.\n\nObviously, different parts of Africa have different nuances so the biggest mistake we\u2019ve seen is founders being caught up in this hot money and taking money from people who don\u2019t have the expertise to give them the help that young businesses need.\n\nAlso, agreeing to chase metrics that may be suitable in other markets but are not ideal in their domestic markets. So you\u2019re doing things because that\u2019s how they are done elsewhere, but it\u2019s not necessarily a smart way to do things locally.\n\nAnother thing is that some entrepreneurs start businesses to solve problems that they or someone they know faced. While that is an excellent place to start because they\u2019re often quite passionate about it, what may be a problem to me may only be my problem; it may not be a problem for other people.\n\nSo what that means is that sometimes entrepreneurs who have not done their research assume that the problems they are solving must be relevant to lots of other people. We often come across businesses that are solving just a small problem, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. But when an entrepreneur says they want to scale into other markets, we may say that problem is not a real problem in those other markets, and doing so would be unrealistic. So I guess it\u2019s essential to understand your market opportunity, and from there, you work out who the right investment partners are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there investment opportunities that you regret passing on?\n\nTo be honest, we do not regret any. I sometimes think when we\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s probably at that point where a business is servicing a large customer market in its local base, and they are doing quite well from a revenue point of view. Then, the question is can they replicate this in other markets? If we pass on it, it\u2019s because we feel that they can\u2019t or there isn\u2019t a market opportunity in those markets. This is why I wouldn\u2019t say we regret passing over an opportunity.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nThere are many, but in South Africa, it would be hearX, which provides audiology solutions to the mass market using technology. The product is a smartphone-powered hearing aid. It\u2019s called hearScreen, and they\u2019ve successfully expanded into the US, so they\u2019ve got partnerships with Amazon and many other businesses and are selling thousands of these hearing aids across the US. They\u2019re now entering the UK, so that\u2019s a great example of a local company that has expanded into the US and now Europe.\n\nIn West Africa, we invested in Kuda Bank, which has been quite a success story. When we invested in the company, the revenue was quite low; I think they had about 200,000 active users. It\u2019s only been a year and a bit, but those 200,000 customers have grown to over 2 million customers, and they\u2019ve received support from top global investors, including Valar and Tiger Global.\n\nIn East Africa, we have another fintech called Tanda. They provide basic digital financial services to dukas. In South Africa, we call them spaza shops, but they\u2019re just local shops. They have more than 20,000 shops. Through their services, Tanda provides cash in cashouts and has probably become the most prominent provider in East Africa. They\u2019re expanding into other parts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, etc., so that\u2019s a great success story as well.\n\nHow do you deal with failed investments?\n\nWe probably have scenarios where things have not gone according to plan. One scenario has to do with my point about things working in one market but not in another. So we invested in a business that was one of our earliest investments in South Africa, where it did very well, but when it looked to expand to other markets, it didn\u2019t do as well.\n\nIn that case, we responded by changing the offering to what the US customers wanted, and we split the company. So we started the US business using some of the technology from the business, but in a very different way, so you\u2019d probably call that a pivot. Fortunately for us, we managed to sell that business to Mailchimp in the US, so I guess what could have been a bad story turned out to be a decent story in the end. I guess that would be a product-market fit problem.\n\nAnother one that is a bit more sensitive and difficult would be when founders have quarrelled, and you as an investor have to try and sort this out. The actual product is still very good, but when two people are not getting along very well, that sets a bad tone for everyone else.\n\nWhat trends would you like to see in the startups coming from Africa?\n\nSo we see a lot of technology coming out of South Africa that could be used in the international markets, so we have 15 companies and three international exits in our portfolio. Those 15 companies are not all South African, but they service over 4 million customers in 180 companies worldwide. So while their main operations are in South Africa, Kenya, or Nigeria, they are very much international businesses. So we want to see African businesses succeed internationally.\n\nThe other one is using technology to service a large part of Africa. I guess that\u2019s why fintech seems to get a lot of airtime because you don\u2019t need a physical bank as long as you have a mobile phone and a decent Internet connection. It\u2019s one example, but there are many others \u2013 eCommerce, education, logistics, etc. You don\u2019t need a classroom to teach people. So we hope that more entrepreneurs start taking up the challenge of serving other sectors with a similar impact as fintech.\n\nIf you\u2019re an early-stage entrepreneur with some revenue, HAVA\u00cdC may be willing to invest in you.

          "text": "The outspoken but widely regarded former chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Attahiru Jega, has lashed out at judges and lawyers enriching themselves from participation in election cases in the country.\n\nJega, a university teacher who delivered one of Nigeria\u2019s freest and fair elections in 2015, spoke of instances where some corrupt judges were appointed to election petition tribunals in order to corruptly enrich themselves by selling judgments to parties that paid them the highest bribes.\n\nAccording to Jega who spoke at the Owolabi Afuye memorial lecture organized by the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), said the corrupt judges quickly went into retirement after they had made so much money selling judgments to the highest bidders.\n\nThis way, he said they escaped being sanctioned by the National Judicial Council.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s laws must improve to achieve judicial independence \u2013 Babalola (SAN)\n\nTurning to lawyers, he said \u201csome senior lawyers have become stupendously wealthy defending corrupt public officials or handling electoral litigation for governorship and presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, many judges have become notorious for corrupt enrichment for \u2018cash and carry\u2019 judgments, especially in election matters generally and in election tribunals, more specifically.\n\n\u201cSome election tribunal appointments were in the past widely said to have been made to senior judges about to retire, who allegedly \u2018sold\u2019 judgments, most likely to the highest bidders, enriched themselves and quickly retired to avoid being sanctioned by the National Judicial Council.\n\n\u201cWhen lawyers use technicalities to subvert justice and \u2018win\u2019 cases without regard to the perpetuation of injustices, they basically help to undermine, rather than enhance national development, peaceful coexistence, and security. They discard ethical and professional conduct, and put parochial and/or self-serving objectives in the forefront of their practices.\u201d\n\nThe former INEC boss said activities of these corrupt judges and lawyers were fuelling underdevelopment and insecurity in Nigeria and called on the NBA and the Body of Benchers to urgently address the issue to save the country from crisis.\n\nHe said while some argue with those who describe Nigeria as a failed state, no person would dispute that Nigeria was fast failing.\n\nHe added, \u201cSpecifically, on insecurity, a combination of militancy, insurgency, banditry, farmer-herder conflicts, kidnapping for ransom, and ethno-religious or communal conflicts, with evident lack of competence and capacity to address these challenges, has unleashed generalised individual and collective apprehension, palpable insecurity, and fatalistic resignation.\n\n\u201cMany citizens have been killed, maimed, raped, displaced, and properties stolen, confiscated, and/or destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have been staying in Internally Displaced Persons camps for long, with the future of children compromised by malnutrition, diseases, and prolonged abandonment of schooling.\n\n\u201cIn some areas of the country, notably North-East and North-West geopolitical zones, famine is imminent, as insurgents and/or bandits have obstructed farming and agrarian food production and destabilised the rural economy, with outright killing of whoever ventures out to their farms, or imposition heavy taxation on those allowed to farm.\n\n\u201cIndeed, things have been so bad for so long that, some scholars are beginning to perceive Nigeria now, perhaps exaggeratedly, as a \u2018failed state.\u2019 \u201d",

New BDC licences were also suspended and the CBN instead channelled the sale of foreign exchange for legitimate needs only to commercial banks.\n\nSuch legitimate needs include Business Travel Allowance (BTA), Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), school fees and medicals.\n\n\u201cMy position is it is not just to restrict sales of dollar to the BDCs but the government should reduce importation and encourage exports.\u201d\n\nHe was concerned that a lot of people depend on importation of food supply as Boko Haram and insurgence have hampered production of farm produce by farmers, leading to demand for foreign exchange.\n\nHe also noted that some government officials purchase dollars that they are not able to consume, but come back and sell at the unofficial market.\n\nNigeria\u2019s trade balance worsened in the third quarter of 2021 as imports surged and the trade deficit hit N3.02 trillion, according to the latest foreign trade report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nOn dollar inflows, the BDC operator said supply is not commensurate with demand as some people who go to the banks to purchase dollars could not get due to documentation issues.\n\nThe operator admitted that inflows come into the country but not as expected. The operator disclosed that there are some inflow markets abroad which a lot of people do not know about.\n\nSome importers who could not get enough dollar supply patronise such inflows abroad at a very high cost, he said. The CBN limits the amount of dollar purchase for PTA to $4,000 and BTA for $5,000 quarterly.\n\nNigeria\u2019s currency registered marginal depreciation in all the market segments, reflecting the effects of the previous month\u2019s policy on the stoppage of sales to BDCs and the perceived supply shortages. The naira depreciated by 1 0.03 percent at the I&E windows, in August 2021, according to the latest economic report of the CBN.\n\nAvailable data from the CBN show that the average foreign exchange turnover at the investors and exporters\u2019 window was $126.18 million in August 2021 indicating a decline of 24.1 percent, compared to $166.16 million in July.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIn the outgoing 2021 year, Barr. Olayiwola Afolabi expectedly continued with his usual media comments and unique philanthropy.\n\nSeveral of them dot the landscape but only few are worth mentioning because of editorial space.\n\nFirstly, here are his media views during the year. Afolabi in May 2021 commended C P Philip Ogbadu for his effort is tackling the robberies and kidnappings at Ahor Bypass on the outskirt of Benin Metropolis. On this date, also, Aflabi paid glowing tribute to Governor Godwin Obaseki for setting up Edo Community Security Vigilante Network which significantly partnered the security agencies in the state to combat rising crime wave in early 2021.\n\nIn June 2021, Afolabi\u2019s attention was on the unsafe Benin/Auchi Road in Edo State. He canvassed the need for surveillance digital cameras on Edo highways /forests so as to rid the Benin-Auchi Expressway in particular of criminal elements.\n\nThe energetic lawyer from Ekiti State who grew up in Lagos State now resides at Yoruba Street Benin City the capital of Edo state in July 2021 he declared his total support for the electronic transmission of election results by INEC in the 2023 General Elections to avoid electoral rigging. During the same month, he criticized the same INEC for excluding Dr. Charles Soludo, APGA\u2019s candidate, from the list of party\u2019s candidates in the gubernatorial election in Anambra state even when he had gone to the court of appeal to challenge a nebulous high court\u2019s disqualification of his candidacy. Later in the July month, Afolabi boldly waded into the raging conflict between herdsmen and farmers in Edo state and without mincing words urged Edo state Government to pass the anti-open-grazing bill, immediately.\n\nIn August 2021, Afolabi openly declared his endorsement of President Buhari\u2019s move to grant full financial autonomy to the 774 Local Government Councils in Nigeria. In addition, he demanded for the stiffen enforcement of the ban on \u201cagberos\u201d in the state following their resurgence in the Benin Metropolis most especially. There-after, he queried the unprofessionalism of Edo Community Security Vigilante Network. He requested for their training to understand the rule of law in security management as well as basic policing knowledge; that vigilantes require backups by regular security agencies during operations. He stressed the need to handover suspected criminals to the police immediately after arrests. To the round of the month, he advised Edo state Governor to rescind his controversial executive order of NO VACCINATION, NO ENTRY TO PUBLIC PLACES.\n\nOctober 1, 2021 was Independence Day for Nigeria. Again Afolabi was by his radio. While listening to the MAN AROUND TOWN Programme of Independent Radio, Benin he phoned into the programme with emotion bemoaning the poor state of Golf Road and the adjourning one leading to Government House, Benin. This was the second time in weeks that he would be calling on the state government to fix the road.\n\nAlso in the outgoing year, Afolab\u2019s unique philanthropy poured like climate rain. In May 2021 he gave out a wig, gown and half bag of rice each to three female lawyers in support of Justice Ester Edigin Fondation. She retired as Edo Chief Judge on May 17, 2021. Afolabi says of the judge: \u201cHer career is marked by great jurisprudence. She is a transparent, moral, ethical and God fearing judge without sentimentality. Her judgements were always upheld at the courts of appeal. On one occasion, my chamber had a case against her in her court. Yet, she gave the right verdict in my chamber\u2019s favour and the court of appeal affirmed the decision.\u201d\n\nIn 2021 Afolabi donated a minimum of four world-receiver transistor radios to a widow, woman, policewoman and a female nurse who first called into the PEOPLE-TALK-TO-PEOPLE interactive pidgin programme of Independent Radio, Benin which runs from 1.30pm to 3.55pm every Sunday. Afolabi\u2019s motive for empowering women with radio sets is to eliminate the gender existing gap in information and communication conscientization in Nigeria.\n\nRecall Prof (Mrs.) Wanggari Maathai, the late Kenyan environmentalist and Nobel Prize winner, says: \u201cThe higher you go, the fewer women there are.\u201d Indeed, there are few women who listen to radio\u2019s serious discussions and contribute to them. So, to increase the number of radio activists, Afolabi intervened with his radio gifts on affordable terms and conditions to the selected women categories.\n\nApart from the radio gifts to women, Afolabi gave out in 2021 a bible and N5000 each to a policeman and a student-lawyer who fist called into the PEOPLE \u2013TALK-TO \u2013PEOPLE Programme of Independent Radio, Benin on September 19, 2021. A week later, he donated a carton of indomie noodles to a tailor who met his conditionalities.\n\nLest one forgets, Afolabi held the second edition of Afolabi Annual Legal Clinic And Coaching Lecture Series in his chambers on September 4, 2021. During the year\u2019s event, Afolabi honoured Austin Aleghe (Esq) for his dogged fight to rid the legal profession of charlatans. Also, Afolabi honourred the Lion Bar of Edo NBA, as well as gave out wigs/gowns to young lawyers and cash gift to winners of his essay competition held annually to mark the event.\n\nToo true, Afolabi did not disappoint his God and silent admires in 2021 in sustaining his life of philanthropy. He demonstrated the biblical statement in PROVERBS that the little of a kind, righteous man is better than all the riches of an ungenerous, wicked person.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMichaer Odigbe Is Of Jubilee Research And Docummentation Centre Benin City.\n\n...",

When a story is reported in multiple places and from trustworthy sources, it\u2019s more likely to be true.\n\n\u201cThe third one is to look out for messages that look different, If you receive messages that have misspelled words, wrong dates, awkward layouts, unrelated pictures and web addresses (URLs), it\u2019s a sign that the information could be false,\u201d Gyekye said.\n\nThe official noted that the last one was to read the message objectively, adding that users should not let what they know get in the way of their judgment.\n\nGyekye said it was necessary to review facts oneself before sharing information, noting that stories that seem hard to believe are often untrue.\n\nThe WhatsApp official noted that today the app protects the personal communication of over two billion users all over the world, securing it with end-to-end encryption by default.\n\n...",

The telco gave the assurance at the one-day stakeholder engagement workshop and capacity building interactive session organized in collaboration with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), held last weekend in Abuja.\n\nThe workshop was organized to examine the capabilities and challenges in the NIMC service delivery process to proffer solutions to identified challenges.\n\nDelivering his remarks, Chief Executive Officer, 9mobile, Juergen Peschel, commended the management of NIMC for supporting the workshop to engage stakeholders in the industry. He said, \u201c9mobile will continue to play a pivotal role in the country\u2019s national identity management enrollment scheme, especially in the rural areas where we have the mandate to register 10 million individuals. To ensure that we meet up with the target, we are constantly expanding our capacity in terms of infrastructure and technology to ensure that all Nigerians are enrolled.\u201d\n\nDirector of Sales, 9mobile, Oluwatosin Olulana, stressed the need for ongoing engagement with stakeholders to strengthen the nation\u2019s identity management process. He said, \u201c9mobile will be sharing resources with NIMC to improve the process of service delivery. In addition, mobile connectivity will also be made available for the next six months to aid the virtual working process. We are currently arranging to provide up to 20Mbps fiber connectivity for NIMC office use.

          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pledged to collaborate with relevant stakeholders on real estate investments in a bid to bring about a reduction in the housing deficit in the country.\n\nDirector General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda made the pledge during a meeting with the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers in Abuja, Wednesday.\n\nYuguda stated that the SEC Values the service that NIESV provides to the capital market and the nation adding that there is a large room for greater collaboration between the Commission and the Institution.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is a renewed focus on Real Estate Investment Trust now, we are getting to see how the sector contributes more to our GDP by facilitating the trading of assets in the real estate sector. I think there is a huge room for collaboration, you have a very big role in the real estate sector.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population is growing fast and we need everyone in Nigeria to have a roof over their heads. We do not want people to end their careers living in rented accommodation, people need to own their own houses because there is a lot of security and social value in owning your own house.\n\n\u201cYou are very important as you operate in an area that is very important to our economy. You have a crucial role to play in the capital market especially as we focus on the Real Estate Investment Trust sector. You also have a huge role to play in the larger housing sector as at the moment we have not been able to harness the full potentials in that sector.\u201d\n\nThe SEC DG disclosed that the Commission values the services that the association provides to the nation and the capital market adding that there is room for collaboration between the Commission and NIESV so that the housing sector can contribute more to GDP as well as grow the economy.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Chairman Association of Capital Market Valuers Mr Chudi Ubosi stated that determining the values of assets of organizations in the capital market is the bedrock for decisions and a helpful tool in a range of work situations.\n\nUbosi said that valuation is useful in mergers, acquisitions and divestment because it helps to price an organization and to estimate and value synergies as well as assess potentials of different strategic options among others.\n\nHe said \u201cAnother useful bye product of conducting asset valuation prior to listing and during the currency of listing is to check asset stripping which we have seen recently in organizations and companies. The resulting documents from valuation will certainly make this impossible as it will make management accountable.\n\n\u201cValuation will also comment on sub-optimal use of asset which can lead to under valuation. Using mainly market approach as rearrangement of asset use can bring out hidden values in the company under question.\n\n\u201cWhen businesses want to raise money, when they need to determine how much should be raised as well as when they approach the negotiating table, valuations are needed in all instances.\u201d\n\nUbosi stated that when there are valuations that have integrity, it will boost investors\u2019 confidence in the market as investors can ascertain that what is being valued is actual and nothing is hidden.\n\nHe stated that the role of Capital Market Valuers in determining the value of the assets of these companies will ensure transparency, accountability and continued enhancement of investor confidence in the market.\n\n\u201cAs SEC recognizes us with insistence that all capital market valuations be undertaken by our members, you will rest assured that anytime an operator wants to capitalize or re-capitalize their assets, the valuation reports done by our members will help engender confidence in the process\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, President and Chairman of Council NIESV, Mr. Emmanuel Wike commended the SEC Management on the huge contribution the capital market is making to the economic development of the country and solicited for the strengthening of collaboration between the Commission and his Institution.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Umar El-Yakub, while speaking to our correspondent via telephone noted that the communications between the president and the National Assembly is not a secret affair, adding that such communication would have been read on the floor of the parliament.\n\n\u201cThe long and short of it is that there has never been any communication of such, there is nothing like that.

The Bill was transmitted on the 19th November, so the president has 10 more days,\u201d El-Yakub said.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahood Yakubu, has said it was purely the responsibility of political parties to conduct primary elections, either direct or indirect.\n\nYakubu made this known while fielding questions from journalists shortly after he met with the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations.\n\nWhen pointedly asked if the commission had submitted the cost of monitoring direct primaries of political parties, the chairman said, \u201cINEC did not come up with any cost for the conduct of primaries per political parties by the direct method. We have had very good discussions with the committee on Appropriation of the National Assembly pursuant to the resolution of the House and what we discussed you will not hear from me. Maybe, the chairman of the committee will tell you.\u201d\n\nBut the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, Hon Mukhtar Batera, said the role of INEC in the primary elections of political parties is minimal, as he said individual political parties have the responsibility of conducting primaries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn our discussions with the INEC chairman, we wanted to know his requirements for the 2023 elections as well as the cost of direct or indirect primaries. On the primaries, when we discussed with him, he specifically told us the role of INEC in direct or indirect primaries which he said is just minimal. He said the responsibility lies with all the political parties. He said party primaries is the role of political parties and not INEC.\n\n\u201cFor direct primaries, what the INEC chairman told us is that only the political parties have the responsibility on primaries and the funding of the primaries,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Bisi Akande is someone I can go into the jungle with, says Buhari -",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Lagos described Chief Bisi Akande, a former interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) party, as a \u2018\u2018perfect public officer,\u201d and the type of person he could go into the jungle with.Speaking at the public presentation of \u2018\u2018My Participations,\u201d the autobiography of Chief Bisi Akande, the President said the author has retained his \u2018\u2018inflexible integrity,\u201d in and out of public office, never accepting or offering bribes.\n\nThe President, who heaped praises on the former governor of Osun State, further described him as a decent, truthful, and friendly person as well as an administrator of the first order, whose leadership qualities made him the unanimous choice as the first Chairman of the APC.\n\nPresident Buhari used the occasion to narrate his first meeting with Akande, his passion for Nigeria, achievements, and disappointment as governor of Osun State as well as his many battles to wrest power from the then ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201dMy first personal contact with Chief Akande was, if I recall correctly, in 2006 when preliminary consultations were coming to fruition for a grand coalition to unseat the PDP Government.\n\n\u201dThose efforts eventually came to nothing.\n\n\u201dNeither he, nor I, nor many of our friends and associates gave up as, in Chief Akande\u2019s words: \u201cthe country was going down and down under PDP\u201d (p.396 of My Participations), \u201d he said.\n\nThe President also narrated how Akande had risen to prominence from his participation in the Constituent Assembly established by the Military Government of General Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201dHe was always in the thick of things through the difficulties and political discontinuities of the 1980s and 90s.\n\n\u2018\u2018He emerged as Governor of Osun State in 1999 when the military handed over to the civilians.\n\n\u201dChief Akande had a horrendous baptism as Governor of Osun State with discord from his own party; his State Assembly (including an attempt to impeach him without any reason whatsoever); from the trade unions and from his own deputy Governor!\n\n\u201dOn top of that, he inherited a deeply indebted Treasury, huge arrears of salary, allowances, and pensions. Enough challenges to overwhelm many aspiring leaders.\n\n\u201dBisi Akande stood four square and faced all the challenges head-on and overcame most of them.\n\n\u201dHis first action was to stop payment of \u201ccritical allowances\u201d a euphemism for government money customarily shared by the big boys in Osun State.\n\n\u201dThis set the tone of his Administration,\u201d the President said.\n\nRecounting the achievements of the former Governor of Osun State, President Buhari noted that it is on record that within one year, Akande had paid off all the salary and other arrears, showing his mettle as a competent and serious administrator.\n\n\u201dBy 2003 Chief Akande had virtually sanitised governance in Osun State having cleared some of the troublemakers from his government and, though reluctant to serve a second term, he was persuaded to run again,\u201d he said.\n\nReflecting on the political history of the author, particularly his bid to seek a second term as Governor of Osun, President Buhari declared:\n\n\u201d It is common knowledge that Akande was the victim \u2013 along with other AD Governors \u2013 of a diabolical double-cross which ended his gubernatorial career. Only the steadfast Asiwaju Bola Tinubu escaped the electoral massacre masterminded by President Obasanjo.\n\n\u201dDesperately disappointed though he was, and being a good Muslim, he accepted this setback as part of the trials of life. He looked to the future of service to the country.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on APC\u2019s ascent to governance at the Federal level in 2015, President Buhari said:\n\n\u201dChief Akande was in the thick of further attempts in 2011 and 2014 to fuse together different groups and dislodge PDP from governance.\n\n\u201dThe key to his thinking which coincides with mine is that Nigeria can only be successfully managed by alliances between major groups.\n\n\u201dAlthough we failed in 2011 but by persistence and knowledge that PDP was driving the country towards disaster, several major parties were able to finally coalesce into APC in 2014 .\n\n\u201dChief Akande was unanimously chosen as the first Chairman of this great coalition.\n\n\u201dThroughout the difficult negotiations, I found Akande truthful, steady and always with an eye to the ultimate goal.\n\n\u201dIn or out of office, he has retained his inflexible integrity. On p.400 of his book, he wrote: \u2018I never gave to or demanded bribe from anyone all my life.\u2019 A perfect gentleman. A perfect public officer, he said.\n\nQuoting a famous Hausa saying, \u201dLabarin zucciya a tambayi fuska\u201d (loosely translated -if you want to know what is in a man\u2019s heart watch his face), President Buhari affirmed that Akande has a permanent smile on his face, saying \u201dHe is the type I will go into the jungle with.\u201d\n\nOn the book, President Buhari recommended it to students of Nigeria politics and the general public alike.\n\n\u201dThis book is a historical document. Students will find this an invaluable source of Nigeria\u2019s politics, notably between 1999 and 2020,\u201d he said.",

He showed me what he is doing in the state like the Atan-Agbara road. He is determined to construct the Agbado road. He is also doing massive housing projects to take care of the middle class.

          "title": "Biden Sounds Alarm at Virtual Summit About Global Democracy",
          "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday opened the first White House Summit for Democracy by sounding an alarm about a global slide for democratic institutions and called for world leaders to \u201clock arms\u201d and demonstrate democracies can deliver.\n\nBiden called it a critical moment for fellow leaders to redouble efforts on bolstering democracies. In making the case for action, he noted his own battle win passage of voting rights legislation at home and alluded to the United States\u2019 own challenges to its democratic institutions and traditions.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent matter,\u201d Biden said in remarks to open the two-day virtual summit. \u201cThe data we\u2019re seeing is largely pointing in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nThe video gathering, something that Biden had called a priority for the first-year of his presidency, comes as he\u2019s repeatedly made a case that the U.S. and like-minded allies need to show the world that democracies are a far better vehicle for societies than autocracies.\n\nThe premise is a central tenet of Biden\u2019s foreign policy outlook \u2014 one that he vowed would be more outward looking than his predecessor Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First approach.\n\nBut the gathering also drew backlash from the United States\u2019 chief adversaries and other nations that were not invited to participate.\n\nAhead of the summit, the ambassadors to the U.S. from China and Russia wrote a joint essay describing the Biden administration as exhibiting a \u201cCold-War mentality\u201d that will \u201cstoke up ideological confrontation and a rift in the world.\u201d The administration has also faced scrutiny over how it went about deciding which countries to invite.\n\nAfter Biden\u2019s opening remarks, leaders took turns delivering their own remarks on the state of democracy\u2014many prerecorded\u2014 with many reflecting on the stress that rapidly evolving technology is having on their nations. They also bemoaned the increase of disinformation campaigns aimed at and undermining institutions and elections.\n\n\u201cThe democratic conversation is changing,\u201d said Denmark\u2019s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \u201cNew technologies and large tech companies are increasingly setting the stage for the democratic dialogue, sometimes with more emphasis on reach than on freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. may be at its own pivot point.\n\nLocal elected officials are resigning at an alarming rate amid confrontations with angry voices at school board meetings, elections offices and town halls. States are passing laws to limit access to the ballot, making it more difficult for Americans to vote. And the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol has left many in Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party clinging to his false claims of a stolen election, eroding trust in the accuracy of the vote.\n\nBiden has said passage of his ambitious domestic agenda \u2014 the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill he signed into law, as well as the roughly $2 trillion \u201cBuild Back Better Act\u201d of social and climate change initiatives moving through the Senate \u2014 will demonstrate how democracy can improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nSome advocates also want Biden to focus on other ways to shore up democracy at home. One early test will come Thursday as the House moves to approve the Protecting Our Democracy Act, the third in a trio of bills \u2014 alongside the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2014 largely backed by Democrats in Congress but stalled by Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe United States has a thriving democracy, but it\u2019s been hurting in recent years,\u201d said Michael Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House, whose annual report marked a 15th consecutive year of a global democratic slide. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re going through a phase in America where it\u2019s very difficult to get things done and to really prove that democracy can deliver.\u201d\n\nIn its new annual report released Wednesday, CIVICUS Monitor, a global rights index, said 13 countries saw their civic freedoms downgraded in 2021 from the previous year. Only one, Mongolia, saw civic freedoms improve, according to the report. Of the 197 countries graded by the group, only 39 were rated as open societies.\n\nA Pew Research Center report released this week said that while \u201cpeople like democracy, their commitment to it is often not very strong.\u201d Even wealthy countries, including the U.S., have some people who favor military rule, the report said.\n\nAnother group, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said in its annual report that the number of countries experiencing democratic backsliding \u201chas never been as high\u201d as the past decade, with the U.S. added to the list alongside India and Brazil.\n\nChinese officials have offered a stream of public criticism about the summit. They have also expressed outrage over the administration inviting Taiwan to take part. China claims the self-governing island as part of its territory and objects to it having contacts on its own with foreign governments.\n\n\u201cFacts once again show that the so-called Leadership Democracy Summit has nothing to do with international public welfare, but to serve the American private sector; it has nothing to do with global democracy, but to maintain American hegemony,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday. \u201cU.S. political manipulation under the banner of democracy will only meet general opposition from the international community.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan declined to attend the conference. In a statement issued ahead of the meeting, the foreign ministry said Khan would not attend without offering an explanation.\n\nWhile expressing appreciation for the invitation, the statement said \u201cwe value our partnership with the U.S. which we wish to expand both bilaterally as well as in terms of regional and international cooperation.\u201d\n\nPakistan is seen as moving increasingly closer to China but in a televised speech Thursday Khan said Islamabad has no interest in joining any bloc and he offered to help smooth relations between Beijing and Washington.\n\nYet Pakistan\u2019s own relationship with the U.S. has been fraught with suspicion on both sides. Islamabad has balked at Washington\u2019s often stated criticism that Pakistan has not been a reliable partner in the war on terror, accusing it of harboring the Taliban even as they fought the U.S.-led coalition. Pakistan says it has lost 70,000 people to the war on terror since 2001 and said his country was ready to be a partner in peace but not in war.\n\nOther uninvited countries have shown their displeasure. Hungary, the only European Union member not invited, tried unsuccessfully to block EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen from speaking on behalf of the bloc at the summit. During the 2020 campaign, Biden referred to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a \u201cthug.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto dismissed the summit as a \u201cdomestic political-type of event\u201d where countries whose leaders had a good relationship with former U.S. President Donald Trump were not invited.\n\nThe White House declined to detail how it went about deciding who was invited and who was left off the list.\n\nFor example, Turkey, a fellow NATO member, and Egypt, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, were also left off. The Biden administration has raised human rights concerns about both nations. However, Poland, which has faced criticism for undermining the independence of its judiciary and media, was invited.",
