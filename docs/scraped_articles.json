Don Adinuba, who is an indigene of the town; the chairman of the Ihiala Local Government Transition Committee, Engineer Jeff Obi; and the Traditional Ruler of Ihiala, Igwe Thomas Obidiegwu, as well as the President General of the Ihiala progress Union, Chief Okey Chukwu, Governor Willie Obiano regretted that \u201ca good number of both the indigenes of the town and people from elsewhere, including outside the state, have lost their means of livelihood\u201d.\n\nThe fire, noted the governor, claimed not just buildings and market stalls but also vital goods and perhaps even raw cash.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is the wrong time for such a disaster to occur, especially given the prevailing economic condition in the country\u201d.\n\nChief Obiano promised that a panel would be set up to determine the causes of the fire and also make suggestions on how to prevent possible reoccurrences, noting that \u201cthis is the fourth time a fire has occurred in and around this major market in recent years\u201d.\n\nHe said his administration would seek to complete the establishment of a fire service in the town, but observed that the facility would be of little value in the market if it is not provided amenities like access roads.\n\n\u201cA situation where the few available access roads in the market are converted to shops which makes it difficult for fire trucks to move into the market to extinguish fire is unacceptable\u201d, he declared.\n\nThe governor also remarked that the Nkwogbe market, built in the 1950s, is no longer adequate to meet the challenges of the modern times.\n\n\u201cThe market\u201d, he stated, was built \u201cwith highly inflammable materials like corrugated iron sheets and planks, and people sold combustible goods like petrol and keresone in all parts\u201d.\n\nChief Obiano described a standard market well planned with sanitary facilities, an efficient fire service and state of the art electricity as a \u201cdesideratum\u201d.\n\nHe announced that the state government would work with the Ihiala Progress Union, the Igwe in Council, the Ihiala Local Government, prominent people from the town and other stakeholders like the traders union and the Anambra State Ministry of Trade and Commerce to provide a befitting market.\n\nGovernor Obiano described the Anambra State Fire Service officers from Nnewi who extinguished the fire as good professionals, adding that when the fire service station in Ihiala \u201cis completed, there will not be a need for firemen to come from other towns to fight in Ihiala except to reinforce or support local efforts\u201d.\n\nHe also lauded Ihiala youth for volunteering to fight the fire before the arrival of firefighters and for cooperating with them when they arrived.\n\nHe asked some other communities to learn from Ihiala youth and cooperate with firefighters rather than block their work.",

Such unity of purpose has been responsible for the continuous acceptance of the party and its consolidation in Plateau State.\u201d\n\nWhile urging the new State party Executives to work in synergy with other party officials at the Local Government, Ward and Unit levels, Governor Lalong emphasized the need for them to carry along all members and be fair, honest and transparent in all their dealings.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that Party members in the faction loyal to the immediate past State Chairman of the Party, Letep Dabang who is currently on suspension are not happy with the outcome of the exercise but the plan to hold a parallel congress did not materialized.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the exercise, Dabang said, \u201cI was not involved so I will have anything to say. I will not know that people are not happy because nobody has reported anything to me. I am not even on ground for the past three days I am not even in Jos so I don\u2019t know what is going on there.

Whether you are old or new you are all equal. In this party we don\u2019t have joiners and founders and that is what separates me from other leaders.

We would support him make sure he wins,\u201d Haruna said.\n\nReacting to the issue of whether APC should zone presidential ticket to South or North, Haruna vehemently rejected the agitation especially from the Northern leaders to retain power in the North.\n\nHaruna asserted that APC should rather consider power shift to the South if the party truly believes in sustaining a very united federation.",

The report is totally false. It should, therefore, be taken as fake news and disregarded.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIndeed, we ordinarily would not have responded to such baseless and utterly illogical allegation but for the need to set the record straight as well as reaffirm the NAF\u2019s unflinching commitment to decisively dealing with the armed bandits and all other criminal elements in the country, in partnership with other services of the Armed Forces and other security agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, it must be stated that there is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State, other parts of the Northwest as well as other theatres of operation across the country.\n\n\u201cIndeed, as recent as October 12, 2021, NAF aircraft conducted five missions in the Jibia general area and engaged targets with rockets and cannons at Bala Wuta bandits\u2019 locations in Kadaoji. Similar successes were recorded at Fakai Dutsin Anfare, an area in Jibia Local Government Area, known for its high incidents of bandits\u2019 activities.\n\n\u201cThe false reportage, therefore, begs the question as to why the NAF would negotiate for a weapon allegedly seized and still carry out air interdiction missions on the same bandits and their strongholds.\n\n\u201cThe NAF is of the view that, this latest false report could be a part of a campaign to further the cause of insecurity in Nigeria by elements who see the NAF as a threat, following series of successful exploits in operations against criminal gangs.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, this provides an avenue for the NAF to yet again appeal to members of the media \u2013 local and international \u2013 as well as social media, to be circumspect in their reportage and endeavour to always verify their facts before going public.\n\n\u201cThe public is enjoined to disregard the falsehood emanating from some sections of the social and mainstream media. The NAF also uses this opportunity to call on citizens to continue to cooperate with security agencies as efforts are ongoing to rid the entire nation of criminals and their activities.\u201d",

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa\n\nCall it the mother of all social events, you are certainly not wrong. Saturday, October 16, would remain a memorable day in the history of media events in Nigeria, The Sun Publishing Limited held its 18th edition of the annual The Sun Awards.\n\nThe ceremony is indisputably adjudged the biggest media event in Nigeria.\n\nOn this edition, the leading media house honoured 24 outstanding Nigerians, for remarkably distinguishing themselves in their various fields of endeavours even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged the world in 2020.\n\nThough the red carpet was billed to kick off at 5:00p.m, guests from across Nigeria and beyond started coming in trickles into the Eko Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, the venue of the prestigious ceremony.\n\nThe tables for 10 and chairs were skillfully arranged and decorated in red and white. They all radiated beauty, panache, fun and elegance. Many would easily acknowledge that each table was alluringly tempting and inviting.\n\nFrom noon, roads to Victoria Island, Lagos were busier than usual as guests poured into the premises of Eko Hotels & Suites, the venue of the prestigious ceremony. From across the length and breadth of Nigeria, even beyond, dignitaries emptied into the venue.\n\nThe exotics cars, Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) that occupied all the parking lots of the hotel were a loud statement that something unusual was happening in Lagos.\n\nFrom trickles, it became a huge crowd just before 5:30p.m. It took the frantic and extraordinary efforts of the broad-chested bouncers mounting the entrance to the venue to maintain a relative level of decorum.\n\nNo doubt, the event was a classic one by all definitions. It exuded finesse, glitz and glamour. Guests, who were elegantly dressed in various attires and looking splendid, were carefully ushered into the elaborate hall.\n\nThe illumination that intermittently filled the stage marvelled all. A look up to the roof dazzled one with lights like a galaxy of stars; it was a beauty to behold. The stage was just on fire, radiating everything about the beauty of The Sun as the \u201cVoice of the Nation.\u201d\n\nAt exactly 7:44p.m, the night of recognition of excellence was properly kick-started with the country\u2019s national anthem. The master of ceremony (MC), an iconic on-air personality, actor and comedian, Gbenga Adeyinka, set the stage rolling.\n\nIt was a night that The Sun shone on brightly on the awardees for displaying excellence even when it was most inconvenient.\n\nThe cream of the Nigerian society, including top politicians, economic titans, media bigwigs, traditional rulers, and entertainers as well as other distinguished people from all walks of life, filled the expansive hall. Indeed, the calibre of the personalities and guests in attendance redefined the annual show and elevated the event above the usual social gala.\n\nGovernors, state and federal legislators, politicians across parties, captains of industry, business moguls, and academics, among others, were in attendance.\n\nThose who have been keenly following the annual awards said that the choice of the magnificent hall suggests the size and stature of the event, which they acknowledged has continued to be improved upon with every passing edition. The crowd was huge.\n\nSetting the tone of the event was the Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Mr Onuoha Ukeh, who said that the gathering was that of celebration.\n\nHe said that the awardees were Nigerians who excelled when success appeared impossible. He added that the 24 award winners were made of sterner stuff.\n\n\u201cWe are not exaggerating. They are resourceful, dogged, resilient, strategic and focused. They could pass for conquerors of COVID-19, having excelled in their respective endeavours at such difficult time,\u201d Ukeh said.\n\nThe chairman of the occasion, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, who was represented by the Minister of Sports and Youths Development, Sunday Dare, described the award ceremony as getting better every year.\n\nThe night was not only restricted to speeches, handing out awards and honours to those who deserved them. There was equally a lot of fun that will remain indelible with those who attended.\n\nWhile the seated guests were waiting for the event to officially begin, the Shuga Band crew sang their hearts out. Singing soul-lifting songs with uncommon passion and exactness, the band members set the award winners and guests in the right mood, making it an evening to remember for a very long time.\n\nOne of Africa\u2019s finest musicians, Kingsley Chinweike Okonkwo popularly known as Kcee, didn\u2019t disappoint the audience as he dished out scintillating tunes that kept the audience cheering.\n\nResponding spontaneously to the indescribable energy, speed and accuracy of the music icon, the audience couldn\u2019t resist jumping to their feet to turn every space in the hall to a dance floor.\n\nThose honoured with various awards are: Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Mallam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (Man of the Year); Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State (Governor of the Year); Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State (Political Icon); and Comrade Philip Shaibu, Deputy Governor of Edo State (Sports Personality).\n\nOther winners are Chief (Mrs) Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, First Lady, Ondo State (Most Supportive First Lady); Allen Onyema, chairman, Air Peace and Dr. Adedeji Adeleke (Exceptional Philanthropist); Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), chairman, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency; Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, Director General, National Yours Service Corps (NYSC) and Speaker, Abia State House of Assembly, Rt.

Babagana Kingibe, former SGF (Lifetime Achievement); Chief Frank Okafor, chairman of Marco Polo Group Limited and Prince Chris Igwe, chairman, Mainland Oil Limited (Investor of the Year).\n\nThough the event might have come and gone, with the fun and excitement of the 2021 The Sun Awards, will continue to linger till the next ceremony next year.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

What we do is a lot of work to make sure that we make this world a better place than we found it. This work is not just me alone, I have a team that spurred me on. For those that follow me in doing what I have done, I want to say thank you and to also appreciate my husband because without him giving me space, I don\u2019t think I would be here. We have made sure that vulnerable women are taken care of in Ondo State even during COVID-19 and today we have an organisation that supports widows and anyone who wants to help us can go to the website and contribute,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Sun Entrepreneur of the Year award winner, Nnamdi Ezeigbo, in his response, expressed gratitude to The Sun Management for the recognition.

          "title": "PDP presidential ticket: Governors, Atiku, others in final battle",
          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nAmid uncertainty over the zoning of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential ticket, governors elected on the platform of the party and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar are now neck-deep in an epic tussle over the control of the structure of the opposition party.\n\nApart from Atiku, others involved in the battle for the soul of the PDP ahead of the 2023 general elections include former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. All the gladiators have their eyes on the 2023 PDP presidential ticket.\n\nAtiku, Saraki, Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto State governor), Ifeanyi Okowa ( Delta State governor), Nyesom Wike (Rivers State governor) and Bala Mohammed (Bauchi State governor), respectively are touted to be interested in the 2023 PDP presidential ticket.\n\nTherefore, for the presidential hopeful, the PDP October 30-31 is first step to determine who will gain the upper hand in the contest.\n\nThe PDP Governors Forum smarting from the face-off between suspended party National Chairman, Uche Secondus and some members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) had taken charge of the opposition party to the chagrin of some stakeholders.\n\nHowever, the governors have continued to call the shots in the opposition party.\n\nThe recent zoning formula for party offices was a fallout of the meeting of the PDP Governors Forum held in September. The governors during the meeting had voted for the chairmanship of the party to be zoned to the North.\n\nThe following day, the PDP Zoning Committee headed by Enugu State governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, zoned the national chairmanship position of the party to the North, as well as recommended a swap of party offices currently been occupied by the South and the North.\n\nIn the aftermath of the zoning, Atiku and Saraki vehemently protested the zoning of the chairmanship to the North, which they considered inimical to their presidential ambition.\n\nAfter the PDP NEC ratified the recommendation of the Ugwuanyi panel, both men worked assiduously to ensure that the national chairman does not come from their respective geo-political zones. Atiku and Saraki hail from the Northeast and North-central respectively..\n\nBaraje Kawu, Saraki\u2019s ally and former PDP chairman, had in a statement said that what the North wants is the presidential ticket and not the chairmanship position.\n\nHowever, the northern PDP leaders, after series of meeting adopted former Senate President, Iyorchia Ayu, as the North\u2019s consensus candidate for the chairmanship position. The former Senate President had earlier been adopted as the consensus candidate of the North-central for the top party job.\n\nAnalyst say the emergence of Ayu has left Saraki with the short end of the stick, and apparently strengthened Atiku\u2019s hand in the battle of supremacy in the opposition party. Ayu, a member of the defunct Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) is an ally of the former vice president, Atiku.\n\nIn the Southwest, PDP leaders are on warpath over the distribution of party offices micro-zoned to the region. On one hand, in the tussle for supremacy is the Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde and on the other is a group of party leaders consisting of former Ekiti State governor, Ayo Fayose; Senator Ademola Adeleke and Hon. Ladi Adebutu, former PDP governorship candidate in Osun and Ogun states respectively as well as Chief Deji Derhorty from Lagos State.\n\nA source told Sunday Sun that Makinde wants former governor of Osun State to become the next deputy national chairman (South), but the Fayose group are routing for former PDP National Secretary, Wale Oladipo for the coveted position.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthey are quarrelling. What the governor has done is that he has given publicity secretary to Ogun, with Segun Sowunmi; from what the governor had done, deputy national chairman is going to Osun Oyinlola. Makinde is looking for a way to placate Oyinlola over the national chairman issue\n\n\u201cThey are saying the deputy national secretary will go to Ondo. But it is not clear who the governor is proposing.\n\n\u201cBut Fayose, Ekiti; Adebutu, Ogun; Adeleke, Osun; and Deji Doherty, Lagos; they are not accepting. Instead, they are pushing for Wale Oladipo to become the next deputy national chairman.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the PDP Governors Forum is pushing for the Director General of the forum, CID Maduabum, to become the next national secretary.\n\nThe national secretary, as well as the national auditor are the two positions tentatively micro-zoned to the Southeast. However, some party leaders in the zone are working to scuttle the emergence of Maduabum.\n\n\u201cThe governors said they want Maduabum as national secretary. But some persons are objecting.That is where we are,\u201d the source said.\n\nUncertainty over zoning of presidential ticket\n\nRegardless, with the national chairmanship position seemingly settled, attention has now shifted to the zoning of the presidential ticket.\n\nOrdinarily, with the PDP chairmanship position going to the North, the presidential candidate should automatically come from the South.\n\nHowever, party leaders are singing a different tune. Several party chieftains, especially those from the North, want the ticket to be thrown open to all qualified persons.\n\nAtiku, in his speech, at the 94th NEC of the party, penultimate Thursday, had said that the party should be guided by justice, fairness and how to regain in deciding its next presidential candidate.\n\nHe noted that zoning is neither the problem nor solution to the problems of the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Peoples Democratic Party has the right to determine its rules on how the party should be governed. The people of Nigeria also have the right to determine who governs them.\n\n\u201cWhere the president comes from has never been the problem of Nigeria neither will it be the solution. There is no such thing as a president of Southern Nigeria, or a president of Northern Nigeria. There is only one president from Nigeria, for Nigeria, by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAnd Atiku seems not to be the only one that shares this sentiment.\n\nFormer governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni told Sunday Sun that the major concern of the PDP should be how to win the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nAccording to Oni, an opposition party does not have the luxury of determining where his presidential candidate would come from.\n\nThe former governor said: \u201cA party that is not in power, does not have the luxury of saying this is where I want my candidate to come from.They should be more interested in how they are going to get into power, because it is not a routine civil service matter \u2013 do it this way, conduct it this away, no.\n\n\u201cThis is a tussle for power and you must adopt your best opportunities. So, I believe that when the time comes, the party will examine every possibilities. And whatever will bring us back to power in 2023 that is what we will go for. That should be my own advice.\u201d\n\nAlso, former Minister of Transport, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, said that one cannot decide for the party where it will zone its presidential ticket, advising, however, that the PDP ensures there is justice in choosing its 2023 presidential standard bearer.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cour party, the PDP, should do everything to ensure that the person we put forward to contest election is the person who can win election. And by the grace of God, we are going to be guided by God and we will have victory. I want to advise the party to ensure that justice is done and the person selected would be the person that will represent the best interest of the party and the country.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, former PDP Deputy National Secretary, Dave Iorhemba told Sunday Sun that it would be wrong to ask anyone not to vie for the presidential ticket of the opposition party in 2023, because of where he or she comes from.\n\nIorhemba said that to do so would amount to an infringement of the person\u2019s right.\n\nHe said that \u201cyou cannot take the political party arrangements to infringe on people constitutional right. This ( presidential primary) is a free election, any person can vie for it, irrespective that the party chairmanship is zoned to any zone. The people of that zone, it is their constitutional rights, you can\u2019t infringe on it.\u201d\n\nRecall that the PDP 2019 Election Review Committee headed by the Bauchi governor, Bala Mohammed, had recommended that the presidential primary be thrown open to all interested aspirants.\n\nHowever, the opposition party is yet to take a decision on the report, which was submitted in March.\n\nIn fact, the PDP NEC only opened discussions on the Bala Mohammed Committee report on penultimate Thursday in the heat of protest over the zoning of the chairmanship position to the North.\n\nThe PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said that the party would take a decision on the zoning of the presidential ticket in subsequent NEC meetings.\n\nNevertheless, Sunday Sun gathered that the PDP may eventually throw the presidential primary open to all interested aspirants.\n\nAnd in the event that a northerner clinches the ticket, the party will re-zone party offices to accommodate the South.\n\nA reliable source in the party told Sunday Sun that the unofficial position of the PDP leaders is that the North will produce the 2023 presidential candidate so as to brighten the chances of the opposition party in the election.\n\nHe noted that the PDP Southern governors, who voted for the North to produce the next chairman, apparently did so because of the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum that the next president should be a southerner.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zoning of the chairmanship to the North is just a game. Everyone knows that the unofficial position of the party is that the presidential ticket will be given to the North. The Southern governors, who voted for the chairmanship to go to the North were just playing to the gallery. They probably did that to be seen as keeping with the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum that the next president should come from the South.\n\n\u201cWhat is likely to happen is that the presidential primary will be thrown open and a northerner will emerge. The calculation is that if the PDP wins the 2023 presidential election, the national chairman will step down and and there would be another convention where a southern will be elected as chairman.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nAmidst the hue and cry over the zoning of the 2023 presidency, a former Governor of Rivers State, Sir Celestine Omehia, has said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will make its position known in no distant time.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, Omehia declared that the chances of the PDP displacing the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023 is realizable.\n\nAmongst other issues, Omehia opened up on the rumoured planned defection of former President Goodluck Jonathan to the APC, the insecurity bedeviling the country, his relationship with his successor and current Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike. Excerpt:\n\nIn 2007, you tried to become governor of Rivers State, you got in and after few months, court scuttled your efforts for Rotimi Amaechi. Those issues that made you to vie for governor, have they been addressed by Amaechi and Governor Nyesom Wike?\n\nIssues in administration of governance depend on the leadership of the government. They could be issues conceived before vying for the position or issues arising from the circumstance of the administration and also issues that your team members are meant to implement or determine. Before I was elected as governor, I had conceived ideas for the urgent and very important needs of the people of Rivers State. This was because of my close relationship with my predecessor and mentor, Dr. Peter Odili. Therefore, when I was elected to succeed him, I had to put the ideas and issues into the administration and hit the ground running. In a similar way, the current administration of Chief Nyesom Ezenwo Wike is implementing his good plans for the development and growth of Rivers State, particularly for the economic and political wellbeing of the people of the state. I must unequivocally say that Nyesom Wike is an excellent administrator and a politician who implements the needs of the people of Rivers State as a whole.\n\nDo you have any regret not completing your tenure as governor of Rivers State?\n\nNo, no, no, I do not have any regrets for not completing my tenure because God Almighty who is all-knowing has reasons for pulling me out at the time he did. Though, I had good ideas and plans for the development of the state encapsulated in my five-point agenda with the acronym \u201cSHIRE\u201d contract. This simply means: Social Contract; Human development and Quality of Life Agenda; Infrastructural Development Agenda; Rural and Agricultural Development Agenda; and Economic Empowerment and Poverty Reduction Agenda. All these would have made a whole lot of difference, but no regrets. The administration of Chief Nyesom Wike has done better and greater things for the people of Rivers State. I have said I have no regrets on how my tenure ended and I am eternally grateful to God and the good people of Rivers State who gave me that opportunity to serve. I have received countless awards for that short period of service and would rather prefer to continue to thank God for that opportunity.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Amaechi and Wike?\n\nOh yes, I have a perfect relationship with Governor Nyesom Wike as a person and an excellent relationship with the administration which he heads. We relate as friends, brothers and political associates. In all honesty, I have learnt a lot of political ideas from him and vice versa. Nyesom is a born politician. Rotimi Amaechi is my younger brother and we relate as brothers in our family, but obviously we disagree politically and have different political ideology.\n\nHow would you compare the eight years of Amaechi and the over six years of Wike in Rivers State?\n\nI was not in Rivers State during the administration of Rotimi Amaechi, so I cannot perfectly talk of his administration. But I can say that the present administration of Nyesom Wike is excellent in all ramifications and Dr. Peter Odili has said that \u201cNyesom has done better.\u201d\n\nWe understand that you are the one frustrating reconciliation with Amaechi. Is it true?\n\nNo, no, no, you are not correct. Amaechi and I have only met once in the past 15 years. This was during the burial of our elder brother, Charles in Ubima in 2020. I believe that there is time for everything. It is not yet Uhuru.\n\nThe politics of Rivers State: PDP has been able to hold sway because of the political stature of Wike even when the state was a battle ground during the 2015 and 2019 elections. Now that Wike is leaving, do you think Rivers State will not fall to other parties, particularly the APC?\n\nPDP has always held sway in Rivers State since its inception. The administration of Rivers State has always been in the portfolio of PDP. I must say without fear of contradiction that PDP has always delivered the dividends of democracy in Rivers State. The people of Rivers State have always resisted the intrusion by other parties even when soldiers and other military personnel were deployed to thwart the people\u2019s mandate in 2019. This is always so because PDP has always presented the best candidate and the candidates have always performed in their social contract with the people of the state. As a former governor and experienced politician, I can testify that the Nyesom Wike administration has done excellently well. His performance will definitely be an edge and an added advantage in the favour of PDP in the next election of 2023. His records in infrastructural development, security, urban and rural development, human resources development, including his political prowess, is an advantage which no other party can afford. This will be only for the benefit of PDP in Rivers State. In any case, there is no serious party in Rivers State that can rival PDP. APC is at the verge of extinction in Rivers State since all her members have willingly and joyfully joined PDP. We are waiting to receive the two major leaders of the two factions in Rivers State. Therefore, 2023 election will see PDP as the winning party in Rivers.\n\nThe tussle in the PDP regarding the presidency and the chairmanship of the party which we have seen where it is going; people have said the presidency should go to the South, particularly, the Southeast and now, we are seeing the North showing interest. What is your opinion? And what is the position of PDP on zoning?\n\nTalking about zoning in PDP, it is a constitutional matter. We also know that a zoning committee was set up and a zoning arrangement was concluded except the presidency or the offices of the legislative houses. The zoning of the National Working Committee was successfully concluded and the National Executive Committee of the party has accepted the report and the zones are already implementing the NEC directive. We shall soon take a decision on the zoning of the presidency. These are the internal affairs of the party. It is a gradual process and we are progressing. The steps taken so far are further uniting the party and breeding peace and understanding within PDP. As usual, PDP leads the way in political arrangements and others follow.\n\nThe ability of the PDP coming to the centre again after losing power to APC in 2015, is it something that is realizable?\n\nOf course, yes. I must say absolute yes. Nigerians have realized the falsehood with which APC used in getting their votes. Democracy cannot triumph on falsehood. Therefore, APC has lost the confidence of reasonable Nigerians. PDP is the only hope of Nigerians for the return of democracy and the benefit therein. The implosion of APC is another factor that will keep the party permanently disunited. Selfish and egoistic interest will not allow unity in APC. So, both internally and externally, APC can no longer stand as a party. God is with us in PDP, which is why you can see the bad eggs who could not withstand the political strength of the good people in the party have left to join their colleagues in APC. \u201cBirds of same plumage flock together.\u201d I can say here and now that PDP will lead Nigeria and Nigerians to political, economic and democratic freedom in 2023.\n\nThere are rumours that former President Goodluck Jonathan will likely go to the APC to contest for the presidency. Will this not jeopardise the chances of PDP?\n\nAbout former President Goodluck Jonathan joining APC remains a rumour. He has not come out to tell the world that he is leaving PDP. My last check, the former president is still a bonafide member of PDP. He must be accorded his due respect. We should credit him with the intelligence that he will not destroy the reputation and the international image he has built in the years past as a leader and mentor in PDP. As a General in the Army, he cannot pick his gun and fire against the soldiers he is leading to war.\n\nInsecurity is escalating every day across the country. Are you not bothered that this can hamper elections in 2023?\n\nYes, insecurity is the bane in Nigeria today. It looks like Nigeria is in a state of war; from East to the West, from North to the South, nowhere is secure. This is the result of maladministration in Nigeria. I believe that these people will put down their arms of war during the election in 2023 to push out APC who is their major enemy in government.\n\nWhat method did you deploy to tackle insecurity during your stint in Rivers State that you think the Federal Government can emulate?\n\nYou mean the method we applied as government of Rivers State? We applied the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d method where we set up a Peace and Rehabilitation Committee who talked with the cult groups and made them appreciate the need to embrace peace and unite with the people of Rivers State. This method snowballed into the establishment of the Presidential Peace and Conflict Resolution Committee for the Niger Delta, a mirror version of the State Committee under the chairmanship of the late Senator David Brigidi. This committee later concluded its work and was replaced with the Presidential Amnesty Programme under the Office the Vice President with Senator Heineken Lokpobiri as secretary. This method brought in the needed peace and economic growth in Rivers State, Niger Delta and Nigeria as a whole. My conclusion is that, there should be a peaceful approach in every warring situation for Nigeria to have all other benefits.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "In a Dramatic Shift, Kingibe Says Nigeria\u2019s Unity Negotiable",
          "text": "\u2022Tambuwal: We need a detribalised leader\n\nFestus Akanbi and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nContrary to the claims by many Nigerian leaders that the unity of the country is non-negotiable, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, has declared that the unity of Nigeria is negotiable.\n\nGovernor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has however stated that what the country needs at this moment is a detribalised leader with a large heart to accommodate the diverse interests of the people.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at The Sun Newspaper Awards for 2020 held in Lagos, Kingibe however said even the union between a husband and wife is negotiable.\n\nThe accomplished diplomat further stated that any part of Nigeria that wants to pull out of the country should be advised to think about the implications of leaving Nigeria and what will happen to its landmass.\n\nHe reminded separatist agitators that the land they reside would not be carved out and taken to anywhere in the event of their leaving Nigeria, pointing out that the land would remain where it is.\n\nKingibe, who received the newspaper\u2019s \u2018Lifetime Achievement Award,\u2019 called on Nigerians to learn to respect one another.\n\nHe pointed out that he recorded all his achievements as a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cI was born in Nigeria. I was groomed in Nigeria. I believe in Nigeria. People of my generation believe in Nigeria. We have no doubt about the fact that we have no option, but Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, I think that a few of my colleagues believe that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable. Of course, it is negotiable. Even the unity of a family is negotiable. Even the constitution of husband and wife is negotiable. The moment either parties feels this union is no longer bearable, that he or she will rather go his/her way. You help them to sit down consider their condition after a careful and rational examination of the pros and cons of how to be married that they take the decision which suit them best.\n\n\u201cIt is enough just to say I do not farewell where I am. So, I am going,\u201d Kingibe explained.\n\nHe, however, added that any party that wants to pull out from the union should consider the implications.\n\n\u201cAre you sure where you are going? Are you sure of the consequence of where you are going? Do you really feel that the grass is greener on the other side? If you do, sit with your partner in respect, in mutual respect, in love if possible, but without demonising your husband or your wife because you will always remain the ex of the other person. But discuss quietly so that even if you separate in the future you can inter-relate with love and respect,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking specifically on the issue of those agitating to leave the country, Kingibe said: \u201cWhen we ever say we want to go away, I do not think they realise the going away. It is not that you carve out the piece of land, take it up and put it in other side of Ghana. The piece of land will be here. You will be here. Everybody will be here. And we all want to prosper. My appeal to everyone is, please, let us be respectful of one another. Let us not demonise one another. Let us respect the views of everybody,\u201d he noted.\n\nKingibe hailed a former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for creating a platform that would enable this dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe awardees are from everywhere. I listened carefully to the remarks made by the awardees before me. Two of them from the South-east ended their remarks by saying, I \u2018believe in one Nigeria.\u2019 I presume, it is a reflection of the fact that they achieved whatever they did because they are Nigerians. We can all achieve our goals in Nigeria. We are only part of a greater entity, be it ECOWAS. ECOWAS is one part of a greater entity called Africa and Africa exists in a globalised world.\n\n\u201cWherever you go, you will remain a Nigeria, an ECOWAS citizen, an African citizen or a global citizen. So, please, let us mind our language as we address national issues. Whatever I achieved, I stood on the shoulders of great people, many of whom have deserted us, but without them, I cannot be what I am today,\u201d Kingibe explained.\n\nTambuwal: We Need a Detribalised Leader\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Tambuwal of Sokoto State has stated that what Nigeria needs at this moment is a detribalised leader with a large heart to accommodate the diverse interests of the people.\n\nTambuwal stated this when the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Ayokunle Samson Olasupo, paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House in Sokoto.\n\nIn a statement by Tambuwal\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Muhammad Bello, the governor argued that no one or group of people, no matter their religious affiliation or tribe can arrogate the leadership of Nigeria to themselves to the exclusion of other parts of the country.\n\nTambuwal noted that the leadership of the country is mutually complementary, adding that Nigeria belongs to every Nigerian and that no one will send anyone out of the country hence the need to remain together for the betterment of the country.\n\nThe Sokoto State governor insisted that the kind of leadership the country needs will understand the issues of diversities and is inclusive in his approach to governance, without tribal or religious sentiments.\n\nPointing out that both Islam and Christianity have been coexisting even before the union of the country came into existence, Tambuwal also added: \u201cthose who know history said Christianity and Islam belong to the same root,\u201d stressing that \u201cJerusalem and Damascus\u201d were examples of places where the two religions are being practised side by side.\n\n\u201dThere is need for us to continue practising the teaching of the two religions as ordained by God,\u201d he said, emphasising that \u201cif we go by the real teachings of the two religions, there wouldn\u2019t be friction or any reason to fight one another.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and the CAN President for their efforts in preaching peace and unity in the country, stressing that Sokoto State is home to every Nigerian, irrespective of religious, tribal, or ethnic differences.\n\nHe explained that in pursuance of this objective of unity, children of other Nigerians resident in the state who attend public schools are exempted from paying fees just as the indigenes of the state enjoy free education.\n\nTambuwal also added that in the area of health too, the state government\u2019s Zakkat and Waqaf Commission pays the medical bills of indigent Nigerians resident in the stateside by side those of the less-privileged state indigenes.\n\nIn his remarks, the CAN President, Olasupo said he was in the state to interact with the Sultanate, the government, and the people of Sokoto State to find ways to overcome the security challenges being faced in the country.\n\nCalling on Muslims and Christians to live in harmony, Olasupo condoled the people of the state over the loss of lives occasioned by the unfortunate incident of bandits\u2019 attacks in some communities of the state.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the state government for its giant stride in providing security in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Wale Ohu, had warned that only the result of the Congress held at the MKO Abiola Stadium would be recognised, a faction loyal to Amosun, organised a parallel exercise at the palace.\n\nThe Ministers of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite; the Senator representing Ogun West Senatorial District, Tolu Odebiyi and the governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement, (APM) in the 2019 election in the state, Adekunle Akinlade were among the dignitaries that fled for their dear lives, when the gunmen struck.\n\nThe trio however escaped unhurt but many others were unlucky as they sustained different degrees of injuries.\n\nSeveral vehicles parked in front of the Palace were destroyed.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that supporters of the faction later regrouped and held the congress.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, the loyalists of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio conducted their congress at the Kara Event Centre along Stadium Road, while the Senator Akpan John Udoedehe-led group elected its officials at Sheer Grace Centre, Uyo the state capital.\n\nSpeaking during the congress held at Kara Event Centre, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, said, however, that the different congresses were working for the interest of the party.\n\nAkpabio, in his remarks, called on the party faithful not to look at the disagreement among the leaders of the party, assuring that such disagreements would be settled at a roundtable.\n\nIn Kwara State, the faction loyal to the state governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has unanimously affirmed the former chairman of PDP and now a chieftain of APC, Chief Sunday Fagbemi as its state chairman of the party.\n\nThe loyalists of Information and Culture Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, re-elected Hon. Bashir Omolaja Bolarinwa as its factional state chairman.\n\nThe APC in Osun State also held parallel congresses in the state.\n\nTwo members of the party were shot by thugs believed to be loyal to one of the factions.\n\nA faction of the APC, The Osun Progressives (TOP), which is loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, held a parallel congress at Ogo Oluwa, Osogbo, while the Ileri Oluwa faction backed by Governor Gboyega Oyetola, also held another state Congress at the stadium.\n\nHoodlums were said to have invaded the TOP factional congress with about eight vehicles and started shooting from the main road.\n\nBut operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel.\n\nHowever, the gunmen shot two members of the APC, Adedolapo Atobatele and Ismail Akinyede.\n\nThe state chairman, the National Congress Committee of the party, Mr. Gbenga Elegbeleye, supervised the congress conducted by the Oyetola faction.\n\nThe Ilerioluwa Group held its congress at the Osogbo City Stadium, where Mr. Gboyega Famodun was re-elected as the state Chairman of the party.\n\nAlhaji Tajudeen Lawal was elected the Deputy Chairman, while Mr. Alao Olabisi was elected the Secretary.\n\nIn his remarks, Oyetola commended the congress committee for conducting a transparent and successful exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, members of TOP, at their parallel congress held at Onward area in Osogbo, elected the immediate past Secretary of the party, Alhaji Rasaq Salinsile, as its new Chairman.\n\nAlso, a former Commissioner for Information in the state, Mr. Adelani Baderinwa, was elected the Secretary of the party.\n\nIn Lagos State, the APC held three parallel congresses across the state.\n\nAt the main congress of the APC held at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Ground, Onikan which witnessed the presence of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mr. Cornelius Ojelabi emerged as the consensus chairman of the APC in the state.\n\nThe congress saw 35 other executive members elected through voice votes.\n\nThe election was conducted by the Chairman of Lagos APC Congress Committee, Mr. Bayo Adelabu.\n\nOfficials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) led by Sheu AbdulWahab were on the ground to monitor the election.\n\nLagos State Governor, Sanwo-Olu, who was on the ground for the congress, said he was not aware of any other congress in the state.\n\nAccording to him, other congresses were \u201cmere naming ceremonies.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking the national leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, the governor said: \u201cAsiwaju has called me twice while the congress is ongoing and I told him all is well.\n\n\u201cYou can see that females are well represented, almost outstripping the number of men. The team comprises men of timber and calibre. I hope the team will take Lagos to a higher level,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Baptist Academy premises, loyalists of the immediate former governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, under the aegis of Akinwunmi Ambode Campaign Organisation (AMCO), conducted their exercise with a former Chairman of the Mushin Local Government Area, Mrs. Beatrice Omotayo Tugbobo, emerging as the state APC chairman.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Tugbobo, who admitted that there were factions in Lagos APC, asserted that the exercise by her faction was being conducted in line with the party\u2019s constitution, which she said stipulated that the congress could be held by consensus arrangement or election.\n\n\u201cAccording to the constitution of APC, you can conduct your congresses whether by consensus or by voting and the agreement from the National Headquarters of APC constitutionally is that we hold our congresses in a consensus manner.\n\n\u201cOther factions can be holding their congresses elsewhere, yet we are holding our own here, which is AMCO, the group belonging to former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, the Lagos4Lagos group produced its consensus candidates at a congress held at the Airport Hotel in Ikeja.\n\nAlso, the congress held in Abia State produced two chairmen as each of the rival camps conducted its congress.\n\nMr. Enyinnaya Harbour was elected Chairman in the congress supervised by the seven-man State Congress Committee for Abia headed by Hon. Kolawole Babatunde, with Hon. Muktar Bajeh as Secretary.\n\nThe congress was held at the sprawling Chidiebere Motors Arena, Umuahia with two INEC representatives from the Abuja headquarters and Abia State office, present to observe the exercise.\n\nThe State Congress by loyalists of Chief Ikechi Emenike was organised at the Indoor Sports Hall of Umuahia Township Stadium.\n\nIn Imo State, the immediate past governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha, and the Board Chairman of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, were absent as the APC led by the state governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, conducted its state congress.\n\nAt the congress held in Owerri, the state capital, Uzodimma\u2019s aide and long-time loyalist, Macdonald Ebere emerged as the state chairman.\n\nEbere succeeded Marcon Nlemigbo who was in interim capacity shortly after Uzodimma took over power.\n\nBut Okorocha, through his media aide, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, said he was not aware APC held any congress in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware that there was APC congress in Imo State. What they did today was a birthday party. As long as we are concerned, Dan Nwafor is the authentic chairman of APC in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThere is an APC court judgment to that effect. It has not been vacated. You don\u2019t put something on nothing and expect it to stand.\u201d\n\nAlso amid protests by many party chieftains, who have called on the national leadership to cancel the state congress and previous congresses, the Senator Ovie Omo-Agege faction of the party in Delta State held a congress and announced a 35-man executive body to oversee the affairs of the state chapter of the party.\n\nA former political aide to ex-governor Emmanuel Uduaghan, Mr. Omeni Sobotie, emerged chairman of the new executive committee.\n\nThe exercise was conducted at the College of Education, Asaba premises by a seven-man Delta State APC Congress Committee, led by its Chairman, Senator Ajibola Bashiru, with officials of the INEC present as observers.\n\nThe factional congress was witnessed by the Deputy Senate President, Omo-Agege; Senate Committee Chairman on Niger Delta, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, founding leader of the party in the state, O\u2019tega Emerhor, among others.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the Delta State APC Leaders Council and the State Working Committee members have distanced themselves from what they described as a \u201cKangaroo State Congress organised by Deputy Senate President, Senator Omo-Agege and his cohorts.\n\nThe APC leaders stated this in a statement issued yesterday and jointly signed by its 19 members, including the Minister of State for Labour and Employment and Chairman of the Council, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN); Co-Chairman, Dr. Alex Ideh; the Secretary of the Council, Hon. Cairo Ojougboh; and 2019 APC governorship candidate in Delta State, Chief Great Ogboru, among others.\n\nThe council insisted that the national leadership of the party should correct the wrongs and anomalies in the Delta State chapter of the party by ensuring the execution of the recommendations of the John Odigie-Oyegun-led reconciliation committee, which had been submitted and accepted by the Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nThe APC leaders vowed that it would continue to uphold the sanctity of the party\u2019s change mantra.\n\nThe Niger State chapter of the party also split into two yesterday.\n\nOne of the factions of the party held its congress at a building along Bay Clinic Hospital road in Minna where Alhaji Nasiru Yussuf emerged as the chairman of the group.\n\nThey were denied the use of the Abdulsalami Abubakar Youth Centre.\n\nThe second congress attended by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello; his commissioners; and the three senators in the state, threw up a former Commissioner for Agriculture, Alhaji Haliru Zakari Jikantoro as chairman of the group.\n\nHowever, it was observed that the state Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, and the member representing Chanchaga Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Umar Mohammed Bago was absent at the congress held at the Justice Idris Legbo Kutigi Centre.\n\nIn Enugu State, the loyalists of a former Senate President, Chief Ken Nnamani, and former governor, Sullivan Chime in Enugu State, elected a former commissioner in the state, Chief Ugochukwu Agballah as the chairman of the party in the state.\n\nAt the congress supervised by the congress committee led by its chairman, Dr. Ijeomah Arodiogbu, Agballah defeated a former military governor of Gombe State, Group Captain Joe Orji (rtd), and Chief Paul Omeje to clinch the position.\n\nBoth Nnamani and Chime were said to have thrown their weight behind Orji, but more than 95 per cent of the delegates queued behind Agballah.\n\nHowever, the faction led by the former Chairman of the party in the state, Mr. Ben Nwoye also held a parallel congress at the state party secretariat.\n\nIn Kano State, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has declared that only the congress held at Sani Abacha Stadium was legal.\n\nPrince Abdullahi Abbas, who is the immediate-past caretaker chairman of the party in the state was elected as the chairman of the party.\n\nIn Sokoto State, the former acting governor and member representing Illela/ Gwadabawa Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Dr. Balarabe Salame has rejected the outcome of the congress.\n\nSalame told THISDAY that there was no congress in the state.\n\nSalame, who is of the same faction with the Speaker of Sokoto State House Assembly and other state Assembly members had planned to hold a parallel congress at DanMarna Primary School before his faction was told by the national headquarters of the APC to wait for amicable settlement of the issues.\n\nBut unknown to them, new executives emerged from the congress held by the other faction, led by the leader of the party in the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the re-elected chairman of the party in the state, Isa Sadiq Acida, promised to return the party to power in the state.\n\nIn Rivers State, the loyalists of a former Senator representing Rivers East, Senator Magnus Abe, shunned the exercise conducted by the loyalists of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nMr. Emeka Beke emerged as the Chairman of Rivers State APC, according to the results announced by the Chairman, Rivers APC Congress Screening Committee, Dr. Abubakar Idris.\n\nHowever, a member of the party, Golden Chioma, who made a last-minute pullout from the chairmanship race, described the exercise and the results as a nullity, citing \u201cfaulty process\u201d.\n\nAPC Suspends Oyo Congress\n\nMeanwhile, the party has postponed its state congress in Oyo State.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the congress was shifted following a directive from the national secretariat of the party.\n\nMembers of the party and journalists who had thronged the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium (formerly Liberty Stadium), Ibadan, venue of the congress earlier fixed for yesterday were surprised to learn about the postponement.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Dr. Abdulazeez Olatunde, who confirmed the postponement, said the postponement was necessary in order to harmonise the list of candidates for the positions.\n\n\u201cIt has been postponed. It was postponed to allow us harmonise the list,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ejiofor Alike\n\nThe United Kingdom government has warned its citizens in Nigeria against visiting 12 states in the country over possible terror attacks.\n\nThe advisory from the UK through its Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) followed concerns on the possibility of terrorists carrying out attacks in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement published on its website \u201cstill current at October 16, 2021,\u201d it expressed concern over protests and a heightened security presence in major cities due to the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe foreign government also urged its citizens to monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.\n\nThe UK listed the Nigerian states as: Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara.\n\nOther states are: Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River.\n\nThe FCDO also advised against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto and Kogi aand within 20kilometres of the border with Niger in Kebbi State, and Abia State.\n\nIt also cautioned UK citizens against travelling to the non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states.\n\nAccording to the advisory, events to mark the one year anniversary of #EndSARS protests are likely to take place nationally, week commencing October 18.\n\n\u201cThere may be protests and a heightened security presence in major cities such as Lagos and Abuja. In parallel, the high profile trial date of a separatist leader is also scheduled for 21 October in Abuja. There may be additional protests and a heightened security presence in Abuja and in the South-east for this reason. In all areas affected, you should monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings,\u201d the advisory stated.\n\nFCDO noted that from September 3, 2021, the Nigerian government had mandated for all telecommunication operators in Nigeria to stop extending services to Zamfara State.\n\nThis, according to the FCDO, includes a suspension of all mobile telecommunications, including WiFi.\n\nIt added that a number of other state governments, including Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger had also implemented a partial shutdown of telecom services.\n\n\u201cSince 9 August, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South-east region of Nigeria. Protests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, are likely during October in the South-east region. There have been reports of violence during Sit-at-Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces,\u201d the advisory explained.\n\nIt noted a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South-east and South-south regions, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi.\n\nAccording to the FCDO, some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations.\n\nIt, however, added that there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas.\n\n\u201cThere is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Travelers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews,\u201d the advisory added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Seeks $55m lifeline\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that half a million women, men, and children in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states are at risk of starvation as its funding for the region dries up.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the global agency, which seeks a $55 million urgent lifeline, said it might soon be forced to cut food rations except it secures urgent funds to continue its life-saving operations in the crisis hotspot.\n\nThe region has been a mainstay of insurgency attacks for over a decade and the situation has been worsened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising high food prices, the WFP said.\n\nThe UN agency also said the number of internally displaced persons surpassed two million in September.\n\n\u201cCutting rations means choosing who gets to eat and who goes to bed hungry. We are seeing funding for our life-saving humanitarian work dry up just at the time when hunger is at its most severe,\u201d said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s Regional Director for West Africa, following a recent visit to Nigeria.\n\nThe WFP director said that current food security analyses showed that 4.4 million people in the North-east did not know where their next meal would come from, adding that more than one million children were already malnourished.\n\nHe cited continued attacks on communities by non-state armed groups, harsh and lean season conditions amid an economy dealing with the fallout from the COVID-19, as portending great danger for the people.\n\nNikoi added that high food prices and a severe reduction in household purchasing power had also contributed to a bleak outlook for the most vulnerable people in the North-east, warning that despite increasing needs, WFP may soon be unable to sustain life-saving operations in the conflict-riddled region.\n\nHe stated that the cuts would come just as severe hunger reached a five-year high in the country, in the wake of years of conflict and insecurity, noting that the situation had been worsened by the socio-economic fallout from COVID-19, high food prices, and limited food supply.\n\nHe added that the number of internally displaced surpassed two million in September 2021, reaching another grim milestone.\n\nNikoi warned that if at least $ 55 million was not received in a matter of weeks, WFP would have no choice but to cut food rations and reduce the number of people it serves, where assistance is already prioritised for the most vulnerable as early as November.\n\nThe WFP, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2020, said it required at least $55 million in a matter of weeks to avoid cutting food aid.\n\n\u201cOur food assistance is a lifeline for millions whose lives have been upended by conflict and have almost nothing to survive on. We must act now to save lives and avoid disruptions to this lifeline,\u201d Nikoi added.\n\nHe said that the number of Internally Displaced People (IDP) forced to flee their homes in search of safety in the North-east had been rising steadily, reaching a new all-time high of over two million in September 2021.\n\nThe United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said cutting food assistance \u201cwill be a painful decision for humanitarians as it will negatively affect children, women, and men uprooted from their homes due to continued violence.\n\n\u201cAs we call upon our partners to step up their support in response to the growing needs, I would like to say thank you to those who have stood with us over the years in providing the much-needed humanitarian assistance in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to its statement, the WFP said it has \u201cprovided life-saving food and nutrition assistance to severely food insecure people, displaced families in camps, and to vulnerable people living in host communities thanks to generous contributions from Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and private donors.\n\n\u201cThis year, relying on the continued generosity of donor partners, WFP ramped up its response to address rising food insecurity and the impact of COVID-19, targeting 1.9 million displaced people in Nigeria with life-saving food assistance.\n\n\u201cTo sustain humanitarian operations in the North-east Nigeria until March 2022, WFP urgently requires $197 million.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022South-west considers Arapaja for deputy national chairman\n\n\u2022How Wike, Ikpeazu, Ugwuanyi influenced the emergence of consensus national secretary\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFollowing the emergence of a former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, as the consensus candidate for the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), pressure is being mounted on the suspended national chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, to withdraw the suit seeking the reaffirmation of his four-year tenure of office in line with Section 59 (3) Constitution of the PDP, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAyu\u2019s emergence is expected to pave the way for a possible southern presidential candidate in the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a new realignment of political forces in the South-west, the party stakeholders in the region may have dumped the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former National Secretary of the party, Prof. Wale Oladipo, and asked the National Vice Chairman (South-west), Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja, to seek reelection as the Deputy National Chairman (South).\n\nFresh facts have also emerged on how Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State upstaged the former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, and former governors of Imo State, Achike Udenwa and Emeka Ihedioha to produce a consensus candidate for the National Secretary of the PDP.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the emergence of Ayu as the northern consensus candidate for the National Chairman of the PDP, some selected leaders and stakeholders of the PDP have been reaching out to Secondus to withdraw his court case because of the implications and consequences the Court of Appeal judgment may have on the preparations for the October 31 national convention of the party.\n\nSome loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar have also called on the party to resolve all issues relating to Secondus or be ready to lose the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe High Court of Rivers State sitting in Degema had suspended Secondus as national chairman, but the suspension was set aside by a Kebbi State High Court.\n\nBut no sooner had the Kebbi court set the order aside than another High Court in Calabar, Cross River State reinforced the suspension of the embattled national chairman.\n\nSecondus has since appealed the orders of the two high courts at the Court of Appeal, where he is asking the court to reaffirm his four years tenure of office in line with Section 59 (3) Constitution of the PDP.\n\nIn the last sitting of the Court of Appeal, the court in a dramatic manner announced the transfer of the Secondus\u2019 appeal to Port Harcourt, stating that it was where the substantive suit originated.\n\nBut PDP stakeholders have wondered why the President of the Court of Appeal directed that the appeal between Senator Ugochukwu Uba and Valentine Ozigbo would be heard in Abuja, instead of Enugu.\n\nA source close to Secondus told THISDAY that the embattled national chairman has adopted a studied silence and refused to respond to the barrage of requests for him to withdraw the Court of Appeal suit against his suspension.\n\nThe Court of Appeal is expected to deliver judgment at any moment.\n\nAs the party continues preparation for the October 31 national convention, Atiku\u2019s former Special Adviser, Dr. Umar Ardo, has called on the party to resolve all issues relating to Secondus or be ready to lose the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is my assessment of the material politics on the ground that until the Secondus issue is justly and conclusively resolved, it \u2018ll be delusional to think PDP will go into the election cycle of 2023 with the faintest hope of coming out victorious,\u201d Ardo said in a statement.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe variables don\u2019t seem to add up for the simple fact that one cannot hope to win on injustice and illegitimacy because this is a logical social law!\n\n\u201cStill our latter-day PDP stakeholders, the old and new party oligarchs, seem to see that they can, forgetting that they\u2019ve always in the past failed. It\u2019s not about the individuals involved, just as of now it\u2019s not about Secondus, but that of torching the hardcore principles of justice and rule of law. Yet, they don\u2019t learn their lessons and make amends.\n\n\u201cAs one who went to court 11 times against the sheer acts of impunity of the party, I know PDP lost in 2015 and 2019 presidential elections mainly as consequences of such acts,\u201d he explained.\n\nSouth-west Considers Arapaja for Deputy National Chairman\n\nMeanwhile, in a new realignment of political forces in the South-west, the party stakeholders in the region may have dumped the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former National Secretary of the party, Prof. Wale Oladipo, for the position of the Deputy National Chairman of the party for South.\n\nThe South-west PDP stakeholders have asked the National Vice Chairman, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja, to seek re-election as the Deputy National Chairman for the South.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the development was due to the crisis in Osun PDP.\n\nIn compliance, Arapaja, at the weekend resigned as the vice national chairman for South-west and obtained a nomination form to seek election as the consensus deputy national chairman (South).\n\nBefore then, stakeholders of the PDP had scheduled Oyinlola as the deputy national chairman for South.\n\nThe most contentious of the positions, which party leaders tried but failed to reach an agreement on, is the seat of Deputy National Chairman (South), zoned to Osun State and desired by Oyinlola, and Oladipo.\n\nThe Sunday Bisi-led Osun State chapter of the party, said to be loyal to the PDP governorship candidate in the 2019 elections, Senator Ademola Adeleke, had nominated Oladipo for the position ahead of the convention.\n\nBut Arapaja, who is said to be loyal to the Oyo State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde, was told by party leaders in the South-west to resign and obtained a nomination form for the deputy national chairman.\n\nHow Wike, Ikpeazu, Ugwuanyi Influenced Emergence of Consensus National Secretary\n\nMeanwhile, fresh facts have also emerged on how Governors Wike of Rivers State; Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and Ikpeazu of Abia State upstaged the former Senate President, Senator Anyim, and former governors of Imo State, Udenwa and Ihedioha to produce the consensus candidate for the National Secretary of the PDP.\n\nThe PDP South-east Zonal Caucus of the party had on Thursday in Enugu, adopted Senator Sam Nnaemeka Anyanwu, who was backed by Wike, as the consensus candidate of the zone for the job of PDP National Secretary.\n\nBefore the adoption, former Minister of Aviation and Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr. Osita Chidoka believed to be sponsored by a presidential aspirant from the South-east; and the Director-General of the PDP Governors Forum, Hon. Cyril Maduabum, who was perceived to be sponsored by the Chairman of the forum, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State were the front-runners.\n\nBefore the announcement of Anyanwu as the consensus national secretary, Wike flew into Enugu, where he was believed to have held brief discussions with Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu at the airport before he left.\n\nThereafter, Governors Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu went to the meeting where the adoption of Anyanwu was announced by the National Vice Chairman of PDP in the zone, Ali Odefa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nThe development comes as the sportswear manufacturer terminated a four-year contract it had with Nigeria in a letter dated Wednesday, August 4, 2021, and signed by the company\u2019s director, Manuel Edlheimb.\n\nAccording to reports, the AFN under the leadership of Ibrahim Gusau had entered into a controversial $2.76 million deal with PUMA on July 24, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe deal reportedly led to a major crisis that split the athletics body into two factions, with Gusau and AFN First Vice President, Sunday Adeleye accused of sidelining other members of the board during the signing of the deal.\n\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\n\nPart of the contract is that PUMA will supply apparel to all age categories to Nigeria\u2019s Athletics team for four years at no cost.\n\nIn addition, gold medalists at the Olympic Games will earn $15,000 (N6 million), silver medalists will get $5,000 (N2 million) while a bronze medal will fetch athletes wearing the PUMA apparel at the games $3,000 (N1.2 million).\n\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\n\nAccording to a source quoted by Punch, the sports ministry would be made a party to the suit \u201cbecause they issued a memo granting AFN permission to seek sponsorship. PUMA sees AFN as a representative of Nigeria with that memo. It gave them confidence that AFN had approval. They also claimed that as of the time of signing the contract, the parties involved are recognised by law and FG, and there was no faction to warrant suspicion. They believe an administration is a continuum and the agreement has government backing..\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by the AFN First Vice President, Adeleye while appearing on Arise TV as a guest on Thursday.\n\nWhile displaying evidence and documents showing the FG\u2019s approval for the federation to seek a sponsor, Adeleye said, \u201cThe contract is a non-disclosure one. It is between PUMA and AFN with FMYSD\u2019s permission. We warned that this may lead to litigation and wrote to all parties involved, including finance and justice ministries.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that PUMA will go to court on this matter. Their officials have called that they are sending documents from their legal department. We wrote the minister on the implications for Nigeria. This won\u2019t make other companies deal with Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Gusau-led AFN did everything possible to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\nOn why the kits were kept in a store, he said, \u201cOur AFN has been barred from using the facility in the stadium and we needed to run the activities of the association. We have a store and office that we run. The constitution didn\u2019t say our office should be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would take responsibility for the termination of the contract, Adeleye said, \u201cWe should be awarded because we are patriotic. The Federal Government asked federations to look for sponsors (before Sunday Dare). This contract precedes him. They are aware of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe worked with instruction. We looked for a sponsor so that the burden can be taken off the Federal Government. The sports ministry should be sanctioned. We need a shake-up in the sports ministry.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the minister and sports ministry under his administration. Our problems have never been this worse. Federations have issues but not to this extend. Despite a court order, the minister is resolute in destroying some people. We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A. Elijah, Secretary-General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view, therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ an internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nThe contract termination comes a few hours after a trending video showed Nigeria\u2019s shot put medal hopeful, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washing his jersey ahead of his final game at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe caption in the video indicated that the athlete was given one jersey for the competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey,\u201d he wrote.",

Instead, it has continued to worsen the tension in the country. It has continued to show itself as a party that is troubled from within and only waiting to implode at any time.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be wary of the APC. If the APC congresses turned out this bad, one can only imagine the type of mayhem that would characterize its primaries as well as their involvement in the general election.\n\n\u201cThe APC state congresses present an unprecedented scenario in the history of our nation, where a party which produced the incumbent President, will have its ranks so torn down in shameful spectacle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNigerians should make a correct interpretation of the signal sent out by APC congresses, which is that the ruling party is a mere contraption and an inchoate body of desperate elements. Such a party cannot organise for the genuine development of the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our party, the PDP is not however unaware of the efforts by the APC to inject crisis into our congresses but we commend the deft handling of issues in all our congresses to avert a crisis situation plotted by the APC.\u201d\n\nThe PDP asked Nigerians to reject APC in 2023, saying the party is a \u201cconflict-provoking, and troubled political special purpose vehicle\u201d.",

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa currently operates in a hybrid co-living and remote work environment. About half of the team live on the same premises, and once every month, we take a trip to the market to stock up on food items. Almost without fail, we discover that the prices of foodstuffs have increased since our last visit. Often, we complain, but because we have to eat, we pay for the products.\n\nRising food prices have become commonplace in Nigeria in recent years. However, not every Nigerian can be like those of us who grumble yet pay. For most people, even the slightest increase in food prices could be the difference between sending their kids to bed hungry and having just enough to eat.\n\nI tried painting a picture of what food inflation looks like, but this tweet about the increase in the price of sardines does a pretty good job.\n\nI just bought sardine at \u20a6675.\n\n\n\nIt was around \u20a6600 two weeks ago,\n\n\n\nand \u20a6300 early this year. Advertisement September 23, 2021\n\nWorld Food Day is observed annually on October 16 to draw attention to issues surrounding food supply, production, distribution, nutrition, and starvation, among other challenges. To commemorate this year\u2019s celebrations, we look at issues that affect food production and supply in Nigeria, highlighting the work of two agritech startups.\n\nIn addition, we spotlight the effects of food inflation and steps Nigeria can take to meet its food requirements but first, what is food inflation and what causes it?\n\nCauses of food inflation\n\nFood inflation refers to a situation where the prices of food items keep increasing. When this happens, consumers have to spend more to get the same goods they got at different prices in the past. Demand outstripping supply and supply being affected are the two major causes of food inflation. In Nigeria, the second reason is often the reason for the increase in food prices.\n\nWhile writing this article, I took a trip to the local market where I spoke to the traders to understand why food prices are constantly increasing. Surprisingly, most traders were clueless. Nonetheless, they did provide some insights.\n\nThe first trader, who identified herself as Mama Imole (Imole\u2019s mother), could not categorically state why the prices of food items were constantly increasing. She, however, offered an explanation \u2013 the agricultural inputs needed by farmers, such as pesticides and fertilisers, had become more expensive. It, therefore, makes sense that they increase the prices of their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of fish\n\nAnother factor that affects the price of food is infrastructure, of which transportation is a major component. There is no fixed cost for transporting goods in Nigeria as the state of the roads often varies in different parts of the country. An increase in fuel/diesel costs could also affect prices. To recoup their losses, farmers/traders often pass these added costs down to the final consumer.\n\nInsecurity is another factor that affects food prices in Nigeria. Since 2002, the Northern part of Nigeria has been plagued by activities of the dreaded Boko Haram. In recent years, the herdsmen crisis has taken centre stage, further complicating an already disturbing situation.\n\nConsequently, farmers in the North can\u2019t go to their farms. For a country that imports a significant part of the food it consumes, any disruption of local production adversely affects the price of food items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEffects of food inflation\n\nEveryone feels the effects of food inflation but at different levels, from the mother who has to decide what to leave out while grocery shopping to the trader who has to sell almost twice as much to meet previous sales targets; there really is no winner.\n\nMama Imole believes that increasing food prices present a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Traders can\u2019t sell as much as before because consumers\u2019 reduced purchasing power means they do not buy as much as they once did.\n\nMrs Adeniji, another trader, shares the same opinion. Since no farmer can produce all the food items their family needs, they buy what they need from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more significant effect is one that Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of agritech startup, Releaf, points out. With Nigerians spending almost 60% of their income on food, he argues that it is more difficult for them to invest in themselves.\n\n\u201cThe impact on society is that people are unable to invest in themselves. So, on average, Nigerians spend 60% of their income on food, which only leaves the other 40% to invest in their education, health, passion, etc.\n\nSo if we want to create a world where Nigerians can reach their full potential, we have to create a world where Nigerians can decrease the portion of their income spent on essentials like food.\u201d\n\nTo put things in context, consumers in the US spent about 8.6% of their income on food in 2020, freeing up 91.4% for use in other aspects of their life.\n\nThe role of agritech startups in tackling food inflation\n\nLike other areas of the Nigerian economy, tech and tech-enabled startups have sprung up to solve the problem of food inflation. One such startup is Releaf. Currently playing in the palm kernel oil processing space, the startup purchases palm kernels from its network of over 3,000 smallholder farmers.\n\nThe startup developed Kraken \u2013 its proprietary technology \u2013 which it uses to crush palm kernels to produce palm kernel oil for its industrial clients.\n\nInfrastructural challenges dog the average entrepreneur, and logistics for agricultural products are a major challenge. Bad roads and insecurity add to the cost of transporting agricultural produce from the rural areas, where most of the production is done, to factories or markets.\n\nTo solve this problem, Releaf employs a decentralised approach when situating its factories. Rather than build factories in Nigeria\u2019s major cities, they site factories close to the farmers, thus reducing logistics costs and ensuring they pay farmers adequately for their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nFinancing is another issue that farmers face, one which Releaf tries to solve. In June 2021, the startup announced a partnership with OnePipe to offer digital financial services to the farmers in their network.\n\nAnother agritech startup doing great work in the space is Agricorp, a company that produces, processes, and exports spices. This month, it completed a $17.5 million Series A funding round with which it plans to expand its production capacity to 7,000 metric tonnes per annum.\n\nSince its November 2018 launch, the startup has reportedly supported over 5,000 smallholder farmers with inputs and training on agricultural best practices. Using its proprietary technology, Farmbase, the startup aggregates, registers, and pays farmers for products sold.\n\nCrop2Cash is another startup solving problems in the agricultural value chain. One way it does this is by providing financing for smallholder farmers, most of whom are financially excluded. The startup also provides them with agricultural inputs and options to receive payments digitally.\n\nA plan for food security\n\nAs the cost of food rises in Nigeria, it is clear that something must be done, and quickly too. Data from Statista shows that food insecurity increased steadily from 6.6% between 2014 and 2016 to 21.4% between 2018 and 2020. In plain terms, the number of Nigerians who go days without food has increased.\n\nWhile agritech startups are doing a great job, more needs to be done if Nigeria is to feed its growing population. The most obvious is a massive investment in infrastructure to aid the transportation of produce. Moody\u2019s estimates that Nigeria needs to spend $3 trillion over the next 30 years to fix her infrastructure deficit.\n\nGiven that figure is over 20 times Nigeria\u2019s annual budget, other means of funding infrastructure must be explored, including public-private partnerships.\n\nIn addition to fixing infrastructure, effectively fighting insecurity would ensure that more farmers can return to their farms.\n\nFood is a basic necessity, and a hungry nation can have devastating effects on the economy and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office suddenly felt much colder as the young man took in the departmental officer\u2019s words. His dream of being one of the foremost robotic engineers at a top university in the Francophone world seemed to have ended before it even began as he encountered an unexpected problem.\n\nHe had told everyone who cared to listen in Cameroon that he was going to the prestigious Toulouse III University \u2013 Paul Sabatier in France to study, and he had gathered enough resources to make it happen. After a tense five-hour flight and barely enough rest the previous night, he didn\u2019t understand what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, to be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t pay with cash Monsieur,\u201d the officer responded, \u201cYou have to deposit at the bank and make the payment electronically with your card.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling hopeful once more, he thanked the officer. He darted out of the office, making a beeline for the nearest bank, where he excitedly informed the cashier of his intentions and received another shocker.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a school certificate to open a student bank account and get a card.\u201d\n\nThe young man was at his wit\u2019s end. He couldn\u2019t register for his student certificate without paying with a bank card, which he couldn\u2019t get without his student certificate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault that he went to France with cash to pay his registration fees and tuition. After all, he\u2019d left French-speaking Africa, where barely 20% of the population had access to banking services, so that was the obvious option.\n\nThe young man in this story is Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, a neobank looking to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa. PaySika has just raised $350,000 pre-seed from Angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria to fund this mission.\n\nAlongside Stezen Bisselou-Nzengue, Co-founder and CEO, Nengwe is building PaySika on Francophone Africa\u2019s existing mobile money infrastructure. It offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on their favourite messaging apps. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nIts chatbot helps users open an account, request free physical and virtual debit cards, and make transfers with these messaging apps without having to download the PaySika app or use its website.\n\nWhile the registration requirements for neobanks in Nigeria, for example, implicitly require you to have a bank account already, PaySika requires the phone number associated with the widely used mobile money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission has given him the confidence of investors like Charles Edouard Bou\u00e9e (former CEO of Roland Berger), Benjamin Chemla (founder of Stuart), and several others.\n\nNengwe\u2019s Toulouse experience was four years ago, in 2017, before he and his co-founder knew how to build chatbots and financial services applications.\n\nAs he sat in the bank, not knowing what to do next, a sandy-haired middle-aged man with what looked like a never-ending smile walked into the bank with deliberately measured steps.\n\nLooking around and waving at some familiar faces, he spotted Nengwe, whose hands covered his face as he tried to calm himself down.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Nengwe as he got within earshot, his perpetual smile still in place masking his seriousness.\n\nNengwe glanced at him, unsure if trusting a stranger in a foreign country was his best move.\n\nRealising he didn\u2019t have much choice, Nengwe explained his situation as calmly as he could.\n\nWhat followed was the stuff of dreams, the kind Nengwe had before leaving Cameroon.\n\nThis stranger offered to pay his fees with his card and collect cash. Probably more surprising was the man\u2019s seeming familiarity with his story.\n\nThis man turned out to be one of Nengwe\u2019s professors at Upssitech, in Toulouse University.\n\nThis gut-wrenching episode was pretty much par for the course for Africans migrating to study in France. Bisselou-Nzengue, with whom he would later form a close bond, also had a similar experience after leaving his home country of Gabon.\n\n\u201cLater on, I helped some people by providing them with my card and had them give me cash back,\u201d Nengwe reveals.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick to state that this is not the case for students from Germany or even Asia; it happens to just people coming from Africa.\n\nA seed had been sown, albeit in unpleasant circumstances, and both men would begin thinking of ways to solve this problem, which they figured needed to be tackled at the roots. It was clear that they had to democratise access to cards and digital payments services in countries like Cameroon where, only 34% of its adults have a bank account, DR Congo (25%), and Gabon (58.5%), to mention a few.\n\nBuilding that first MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika\n\nAfter graduating in 2019, he quickly decided that working for a company was not for him and began to put his knowledge to good use, testing some of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI started my first company, MyMoney, a chatbot that connected to users\u2019 bank accounts and sent notifications. But it failed because of product-market fit. We started working on PaySika right after,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nBeing one of the most regulated globally, Africa\u2019s financial services sector is not kind to newbie fintechs with no track record, so building PaySika wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.\n\nExpectedly, the inexperienced entrepreneurs were in dire need of cash to build PaySika\u2019s first MVP.\n\n\u201cWe entered French Tech Tremplin, a startup competition organised by the French government to invest in high impact startups. We received $23,000 that helped us in part to build the MVP at the beginning. This plus friends and family, and our own savings, of course,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nAfrica might have a distinct lack of senior developers, and local startups struggle to keep them, but PaySika is rapidly securing the goodwill of talented senior developers who experienced similar problems when moving to Europe.\n\nNengwe also reveals that while fundraising, he and his co-founder surrounded themselves with investors who understand the fintech and banking spaces.\n\n\u201cI would say we were lucky because we were able to get an amazing network of business people that really helped us understand how this startup business works.\n\n\u201cWe have investors with a background in banking infrastructure. We have some who are CTOs, and some who are really good at hiring. We just surrounded ourselves with people who are knowledgeable about key topics that affect us.\u201d\n\nA fully-locked MVP gives Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue the confidence to look for mature angel investors. Some of whom would later join its just-concluded round. But despite this funding, a mammoth-sized issue remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe financial sector in francophone Africa is heavily regulated. So we started scouring through all the details and regulatory requirements. We then partnered with some financial institutions that will help us implement what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2020, Bisselou-Nzengue, COO of PaySika, decided to hone his business skills to complement his technical background. He made the necessary preparations and left for Grenoble Business School in France for a year-long MBA in international business.\n\nThe new business he\u2019s building with Nengwe needs refining, but they seem to be headed in a promising direction.\n\nWith free physical and virtual debit cards and a 1% transaction fee on transfers, the startup does not look like it will be making much money. Nonetheless, Nengwe believes they are taking baby steps.\n\nThough the startup is yet to launch fully, it already has over 20,000 pre-registrations, mainly (90%) made up of young people aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThis was gotten organically. We didn\u2019t do any sort of aggressive marketing to get people onboard. Just referrals from different people who are excited about what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThe future is within reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNengwe says he wants to make the PaySika customer onboarding process seamless enough to cater to people without mobile money accounts. Once it can get its banking licence, it plans to add a savings account service, which he believes would be a major cash cow.\n\n\u201cWe will innovate in the offline space, so our customers can also perform transactions offline. But definitely not USSD. We\u2019re also planning to hire more experienced developers and build a marketing team.\u201d\n\nPaySika has some interesting counterparts in Francophone Africa. Ivory Coast\u2019s Djamo is building a financial super app, and Julaya wants to help businesses reach the unbanked. Wave, a mobile money service provider, became the region\u2019s first Unicorn in September 2021.\n\nAs recently as last year, it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much attention being paid to French-speaking Africa, but that seems to be changing.\n\nFor Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue, their story with PaySika is just beginning, and we\u2019ll leave several blank pages to document what promises to be an interesting journey.\n\n*The conversations and narrative may not have happened exactly the way we told it.

Trium Networks and other unnamed individuals participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in the fourth quarter of 2019 by Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO, the startup says it provides seamless solutions to Nigeria\u2019s retailers, SMEs, and individuals.\n\nIn 2020, Sparkle launched Sparkle Business to offer banking services to individuals and businesses.\n\nPer Techcrunch, Sparkle differs from other neobanks because it provides Nigerians with financial, lifestyle, and business support services.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the funds will be used to develop robotic process automation to aid in mundane and repetitive tasks, and to hire talent in engineering, financial risk, and marketing.\n\nFacebook\u2019s new policy on sexual harassment of public figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? As part of a new update to its bullying and harassment policies, Facebook announced on Wednesday, October 13, 2021, that it would begin removing \u201csevere sexualising content\u201d directed at public figures.\n\nFacebook stated that as part of the policy update, it would remove any profiles, pages, groups, or events dedicated to sexualising public figures, like celebrities, politicians, and content creators.\n\nAntigone Davis, Global Head of Safety at Facebook, said that \u201csexualised photoshops and drawings, and any degrading content depicting individuals in the process of bodily functions,\u201d is prohibited.\n\nAlso, Facebook stated that it would remove \u201cunwanted sexualised commentary\u201d and repeated attacks sexually harassing a person.\n\nDavis said, \u201cPublic figures, either politicians, journalists, celebrities, or content creators use Facebook and Instagram to engage directly with their followers. We made these changes because attacks like these can weaponise a public figure\u2019s appearance, which is unnecessary and often not related to the work these public figures represent.\u201d\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nWhy Techpoint Africa is making all its past premium reports free.

          "title": "Electric vehicle makers to face Nickel shortage making Nigeria\u2019s deposit strategic",
          "text": "Global demand for high-grade nickel, an essential component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, will outweigh supply by 2024, analysts at Oslo-based global energy research firm, Rystad, has said.\n\nBut this could open an opportunity for Nigeria\u2019s vast untapped deposit if it could resolve its security challenges.\n\nAccording to their analysis, although global supply will continue its steady year-on-year climb to 3.4 million tonnes (Mt) in 2024 from 2.5 Mt this year, rising demand spurred in part by the energy transition will lead to a shortage in less than two years, with a production of 3.2 Mt. This gap will widen quickly to a deficit of 0.56 Mt by 2026.\n\nNickel is an essential component of the batteries used by many automakers, and a supply shortage could cause numerous headaches and ripples across Western car manufacturing. In addition, the deficit is likely to encourage automakers to assess alternative battery chemistries, as well as search for previously untapped nickel deposits, the analysts said.\n\nRead also: Medplus opens online pharmaceutical store, offers 24-hour service in select branches\n\n\u201cThe potential nickel shortage could encourage industry leaders to look to previously unattractive sources of nickel, including deposits in Indonesia. However, the process of extracting nickel from these deposits has inherent risks and challenges, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns,\u201d says James Ley, global energy metals expert and Senior Vice President with Rystad Energy.\n\n\u201cThe shortage has no other obvious solution in sight that won\u2019t tarnish carmakers with several unattractive ESG issues. Therefore, we expect Western EV manufacturers to explore alternative battery options as the nickel procurement problem becomes increasingly difficult,\u201d Ley adds.\n\nThe Ministry of Solid Minerals Development in 2016 confirmed the discovery of Nickel in parts of Kaduna State in North-West Nigeria.\n\nPrivately-held Comet Minerals who holds the mining license said the deposit is almost pure nickel metal of between 0.1 and 5.0 mm diameter in size, grading at 90 percent nickel, as opposed to more traditional nickel, which needs to be refined to extract the metal.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has to resolve the security challenges in Kaduna to take advantage of this opportunity as the current crisis does not make a business case for investments.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the supply crunch?\n\nRystad Energy expects nickel-based battery chemistries to hold the largest share of the market by 2030, slightly ahead of iron-based batteries, with other solutions trailing far behind these two main groups.\n\nLimited access to nickel could throw a spanner in the wheels of this forecast, however, as the battery industry has to compete for supply with other growing industries, such as steelmaking, they said.\n\nUnlike other essential battery raw materials used for cathodes such as lithium, the battery market is not the dominant end-user for nickel in the short term.\n\n\u201cAccording to our estimates, the stainless-steel industry accounts for more than 70 percent of current global nickel demand, with the battery market making up less than 10 percent of global nickel metal demand in 2020,\u201d the report said.\n\nNickel metal demand from the stainless-steel industry is expected to grow at about 5 percent per year, while the market for batteries is poised to explode. In an unconstrained supply scenario, batteries could require more than 1 Mt of nickel metal by 2030, quadrupling from the current demand of 0.25 Mt, the report found.\n\nThe experts said the battery market only accounts for 9 percent of the current global supply of about 2.3 Mt, but forecasts the market share could rise to 31percent by 2026 and this demand surge could place huge pressure on the nickel supply chain in less than a decade.\n\nMining companies are not finding enough new high-grade nickel deposits to keep up with battery production demands. As a result, automakers and battery manufacturers may seek alternative battery chemistries to meet demand, the report said.\n\nSolution\n\nThe primary nickel-based battery chemistries are nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and nickel cobalt aluminium (NCA), while the iron-based chemistries are lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and sodium-ion (Na-ion).\n\nNickel-intensive batteries are the batteries of choice of many Western manufacturers due to their high energy density combined with a lower proportion of cobalt. Cobalt is mainly mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where poor ESG credentials make it unattractive for car manufacturers.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty and risk of battery-grade nickel supply in the coming decade, automakers may seek to decrease their dependency on nickel and instead opt for lithium iron phosphate batteries, where nickel is not required, for certain models or geographies, the analysts said.\n\nCiting the example of Volkswagen and Tesla who have announced plans to use LFP batteries in their lower-end vehicles as the energy density of these batteries has improved enough to make them suited for electric cars, the analysts said this will help reduce the companies\u2019 long-term concerns over nickel supply and could prove a fruitful path forward for other EV manufacturers.",

          "text": "For some reasons, not limited to prevailing economic conditions, small-size apartments, notably 1 and 2-bedrooms, have seen an uptick in demand and investment across cities and market nodes, according to close property market watchers\n\nAn analysis of the market by MDS Properties Limited, a real estate firm, shows that of the 428 apartments surveyed in Victoria Island, over 369 units have been sold amid an apparent lull in the market.\n\nThe company says that further analysis of the units sold, reveals that they comprised 38 percent of 1-bedroom apartments, 43 percent of 2-bedroom apartments and 19 percent of 3-bedroom apartments.\n\nRead also: Residential real estate shows strength with closed transactions increase in H1 2021\n\nReal estate developers and brokers who operate in the Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Lekki axis, offered explanations for the increase in demand for these small-size units, noting that investment interest and considerations are also rising in favour of these units.\n\nSome of these reasons include decisions by corporate bodies looking more at accommodating their expatriates in short-stay homes where they can pay weekly, monthly or quarterly as opposed to yearly rents which they did before.\n\n\u201cThis has reduced the demand for yearly rentals by these companies by between 40 and 45 percent and, in turn, shifted the focus of investors to 1 & 2-bedroom apartments for short-let and short-stay apartments,\u201d the MDS market survey explains.\n\nOther reasons are owner-occupiers looking for a small flat, house or room kept for occasional use in the central business district (CBD); older couples downsizing to more efficient spaces; parents giving their children these apartments as gifts; young families starting out and the steady rise in the number of first-time homebuyers who prefer relatively more and affordable apartments.\n\nAccording to MKO Balogun, Group CEO of Global PFI, six in every 10 persons looking for homes to buy are looking for 2-bedroom apartments, thus authenticating MDS Properties\u2019 findings that 2-bedroom apartments are the toast of home seekers.\n\nBalogun noted that developers with big-size apartments are either converting them to one-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments or allowing co-habitation in which case two or more people pool resources and buy a 3-bedroom or 4-bedroom apartment and share, using the sitting room as a common area.\n\nMany developers and investors are already tapping into the opportunities offered by this segment of the market. African Capital Alliance (ACA) is among the early investors in this market. \u201cWe are responding to what the market says; that\u2019s where demand resides at the moment,\u201d Obi Nwogugu, former Head of Real Estate Unit at ACA explained, talking about the Blue Waters Lagos.\n\nBlue Waters is the company\u2019s 17-floor mixed-use development that comprises mainly 2-bedroom apartments and, according to Nwogugu, all the units had been sold out before the project was completed.\n\nThe management of Cruxstone Development and Investment, developers of the 13-floor Iconic Towers in Victoria Island, tells the same story of rising demand for 1 & 2-bedroom apartments which is why the entire building is designed to deliver mainly 2-bedroom apartments except for the short-stay component.\n\nMDS Properties\u2019 Coral Apartments in Victoria Island is also a premium collection of 1 & 2-bedroom apartments, offering great value to both owner-occupiers and investors. The company assures investors of a high rental yield, leading to a good return on their investment.\n\nThough Chudi Kalu, the CEO of Middlechase Properties, does not see prospects in short-stay facilities in the long run, Segun John-Adejumo, an ex-finance banker and managing director of Precioso Homes, thinks differently.\n\n\u201cFor 2-bedroom apartments, the turnover is high, the demand is extremely high in terms of rentals whether for short let or normal rental. So, if you have a 2-bedroom apartment and you put it in the market, if it\u2019s nice with good location, within one month you have rented it out unlike people that stay in 3-bedroom,\u201d he explained.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari, asking the court to \u201cdeclare illegal and unconstitutional the plan by the administration to track, intercept and monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, as it severely threatens and violates the right to the preservation of privacy.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the proposal in the Supplementary Appropriation Act signed in July 2021 to spend N4.87bn to monitor private calls and messages. The amount is part of the N895.8bn supplementary budget approved by the National Assembly.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1240/2021 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and any other authority, persons or group of persons from unlawfully monitoring the WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201ca declaration that any monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is oppressive and draconian, as it threatens and violates sections 37 and 39 of Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended]; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cThe plan to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is an arbitrary interference by the administration into respect for family and private life, the home, and correspondence. It also fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights. Monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cThe mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.\u201d\n\nSERAP is further arguing that, \u201cPrivacy and expression are intertwined in the digital age, with online privacy serving as a gateway to secure exercise of the freedom of opinion and expression. Therefore, targets of surveillance would suffer interference with their rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression whether the effort to monitor is successful or not.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondents are Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation; and Mrs Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cThe powers to conduct arbitrary, abusive or unlawful surveillance of communications may also be used to target political figures and activists, journalists and others in the discharge of their lawful activities.\n\n\u201cAny spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\n\n\u201cThe lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights.\n\n\u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the right to freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy and correspondence, communications and private data.\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 19 of the Covenant also guarantee the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media.\n\n\u201cThe UN General Assembly has condemned unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and interception of communications as \u2018highly intrusive acts\u2019 that interfere with fundamental human rights (see General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 71/199).\n\n\u201cInterference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Surveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights.\n\n\u201cTargeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.\n\nSERAP is also seeking the following reliefs:\n\nA DECLARATION that monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is inconsistent with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality and amounts to threat and infringement on the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press guaranteed under sections 37 and 39 of Nigeria Constitution, 1999; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n\nA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendants budgeting N4.87bn of public money to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is unlawful and a violation of the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press\n\nAN ORDER setting aside the budget line of N4.87bn to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people for being inconsistent and incompatible with constitutional provisions, and international human rights treaties\n\nAN ORDER mandating the 1st Respondent to redirect public funds in the sum of N4.87bn budgeted to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people to improve the working conditions of healthcare practitioners and improve public healthcare facilities across Nigeria\n\nAND FOR SUCH FURTHER ORDER OR ORDERS that this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",
          "summary": "It also fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality.\u201dAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights.\n\u201cThe lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights.\n\u201cInterference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.\nSurveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights.\n\u201cTargeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.",

Rasaq Salinsile have emerged chairmen of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Osun State, as party members today, held parallel congresses.\n\nWhile Hon. Salinsile was elected chairman in the Congress organised by The Osun Progressives (TOP), a faction within the party loyal to former governor of the state and current minister of interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Prince Famodun was elected chairman by faction led by the incumbent governor of the state, Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe TOP Congress, which was almost disrupted by hoodlums who stormed the venue and started shooting sporadically, but were repelled by security operatives who engaged them in gun battle, equally saw the emergence a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Adelani Baderinwa, as State Secretary.\n\nMeanwhile, Famodun got a second term of four years as chairman of the party in the state, the Oyetola faction being the officially recognized leadership of the party in the state.\n\nMr. Tajudeen Lawal, the current state commissioner for Home Affairs also emerged as the Party\u2019s Deputy Chairman, while Alhaja Kudirat Fakokunde returned as the leader of the Women Wing.\n\nAlso 35-year old Akinwemimo Adegoke emerged as the Youth Leader of the party just as Mr. Alao Kamar Olabisi emerged as the secretary.\n\nGovernor Oyetola while speaking during the congress held at Osogbo township stadium, charged the party executives in the state to ensure a reconciliatory process that will guarantee the unity and strength that the Party is known for.\n\nAnnouncing the results of the Congress, the Chairman of the National Committee on the Osun State Congress, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, said the Congress was done in line with the principles and guidelines of the Party.\n\nHe appealed to sympathisers who were not allowed into the venue of the Congress to demonstrate understanding, explaining that only delegates were allowed in the venue because the event was a Congress and not a rally.\n\nElegbeleye, who read out Article 20 of the Party\u2019s Constitution to the delegates, also announced that voice vote was adopted because of the population of the accredited delegates, which totalled 1,840.\n\n\u201cI wish to start by referring our delegates and party leaders to Article 20 (Elections and Appointment) of the APC Constitution. I want to read it out: \u2018All party posts prescribed or implied by this Constitution shall be filled by democratically conducted elections at the respective National Convention or Congress, subject, where possible, to Concensus, provided that where a candidate has emerged by concensus for an elective position, a vote of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 by ballot or voice shall be called, to ensure that it was not an imposition which could breed discontent or crisis,\u201d Elegbeleye read.\n\nOyetola, while addressing Party Delegates after the Congress, reiterated his commitment to a vibrant and rock-solid All Progressives Congress in Osun, calling on all stakeholders to follow suit.\n\nHe congratulated the new executives, charging them to rise to the occasion by promptly mending broken walls and building collapsed bridges for the greater good of the Party and, by extension, the State.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the newly- elected executives of our Party. I urge you to discharge your responsibility with the fear of God and ensure you carry everyone along in the running of the affairs of the party. Let us have a vibrant party that can compete anywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cI thank the team from Abuja for accepting to serve the Party by coming down to Osun to conduct, monitor and supervise the State Congress.\n\n\u201cI thank party leaders and stakeholders for their support and understanding so far and for contributing to the hitch-free exercise.\n\n\u201cI thank members for your understanding and cooperation with the Government. I appeal to you to extend same to the newly-elected party officials. I appeal to those who lost out not to lose hope. I assure you all of a better tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe All Progressives Congress emerged on the strength of unity and progressive ideals. We are still committed to these ideals regardless of some of narratives making the rounds out there.\n\n\u201cI urge the newly-elected executives to ensure reconciliatory process. We cannot rule out the fact that some members are aggrieved for one or more reasons, but this is nothing out of proportion. We remain one united family, and we remain focused on delivering unprecedented progress and development to Osun\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nIn his acceptance remark, the State Party Chairman-elect, Prince Famodun, lauded the Congress as impressive, well-organised and peaceful.\n\nHe called on Party members and stakeholders to channel the same energy and unity towards the primaries in February 2022 and the governorship election scheduled for July 2022.\n\n\u201cWe trust God that this Party will remain strong and indivisible. We appeal to our family members who are aggrieved and out there to return home. The Governor has extended the olive branch.\n\n\u201cIt is on this basis that I also extend an olive branch to the members of our political family who are disenchanted to bury the hatchet in order to collectively work for the re-election of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola during next year\u2019s governorship election. Let\u2019s join hands together and perform our usual political feat of ensuring the continuity of the ruling government. Time is not on our side. Let\u2019s work for the perpetuation of our government in Osun State through all- known legitimate means\u201d, Famodun said.",

          "text": "Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s regime mobilised armed thugs to disrupt the #EndSARS protest which was organised by young Nigerians last year.\n\nThe protest was organised to seek an end to police brutality, among other demands.\n\nHe stated this in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday.\n\nSowore condemned the hypocrisy of Nigerian leaders who have asked youths to desist from organising a protest in honour of the victims of the #EndSARS protest, citing alleged plans by hoodlums to hijack the protests.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari\u2019s regime conveyed thugs in government-registered vehicles to attack peaceful protesters, leading to the death of some of the demonstrators.\n\nHe further said the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave out air-conditioned BRT buses to the hoodlums to invade a protest venue last October.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cThroughout the #EndSARS protests in October 2020, the Muhammadu Buhari regime mobilised well-armed thugs to attack unarmed #EndSARS protesters here in Abuja, they were ferried around in Government registered vehicles, some of them mobilised through Jabi Park, they injured and even killed two peaceful protesters.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos, Gov. Sanwo-Olu gave out official air-conditioned state-owned commercial BRT buses to thugs to attack #EndSARS peaceful protesters camped at the Lagos State House of Assembly, when they didn\u2019t succeed, they mobilised the HQ Nigerian Army to shoot and murder innocent #Endsarsprotesters at #Lekkitollgate, that global terrorism carried out against innocent young Nigerian citizens by Muhammadu Buhari, Jide Sanwo-Olu and then Chief of Army Staff Yusuf Tukur Buratai led to the untimely but brutal deaths of many.\n\n\u201cNow the same government is claiming they are worried about \u2018hoodlums hijacking\u2019 the #EndSARSmemorial.\n\n\u201cMuhammadu Buhari, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and DSS (Department of State Services) men accompanying hoodlums are the real HOODLUMS! #RevolutionNow #BuhariMustGo.\u201d\n\nBuhari had in the past claimed last year\u2019s #EndSARS protest against police brutality was aimed at removing him from office.\n\nHe added that those who participated in the protest have made Nigeria unattractive to investors.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered last year when there was the #EndSARS protest. You remember the young people that wanted to march here and remove me?\n\n\u201cTell the young people to behave themselves and make the country safe, then we can attract real investors to the country,\u201d he had said during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nThe #EndSARS protest, which was held between October 8 and 20 last year, was a public outcry for an end to police brutality, extrajudicial killings, extortion and abuse of power, especially by officers of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nThe protest, which started peacefully, led to the disbandment of SARS by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe protest was brought to a halt on October 20, 2020, when officers of the Nigerian Army shot at the protesters, killing and injuring some of them at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos.\n\nThis year, the Nigeria Police have threatened to quash any protest held in memory of the victims.",

The presidency has directed that Nigerians exposed in the reports be investigated, those with knowledge of the directive have told this paper.\n\nThe newspaper learnt that the EFCC communicated the invitation to Mr Obi during the week and he has been asked to report at the agency\u2019s Abuja headquarters on October 27 to face investigators.\n\nSources separately said the invitation is in connection with revelations in our Pandora Papers report. The report exposed how Mr Obi incorporated offshore holdings, which he did not declare to the Code of Conduct Bureau when he served as a governor and how he continued to manage his Next International UK Limited 14 months after becoming a governor. In addition, he also continued to operate a foreign account as a governor.\n\nAll these actions, which had been secret until our report, were in contravention of Nigeria\u2019s laws on code of conduct for public officers, PREMIUM TIMES reported. Mr Obi has, however, continued to claim no wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, a source at the anti-graft agency said the Pandora Papers revelations only served as a lead for investigators and that \u201ca number of issues\u201d are now being investigated regarding Mr Obi and his offshore dealings.\n\nApart from Mr Obi, acting NPA MD, Mohammed Bello-Koko, and former minister and serving senator, Stella Oduah, have been reported in the PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 ongoing Pandora Papers series.\n\nOthers included Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State, Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State as well as his associates including former Lagos Bola Tinubu, and Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun. We also reported the offshore links of children of former NSA Sambo Dasuki and billionaire Leno Adesanya.\n\nIt was learnt that President Muhammadu Buhari has requested relevant law agencies, including the EFCC, Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Code of Conduct Bureau to investigate all Nigerians whose secret, many times suspicious, dealings were exposed in Pandora Papers series.\n\nIt is not clear if the EFCC\u2019s action on Mr Obi is connected to Mr Buhari\u2019s directive.\n\nHowever, a source said the anti-graft agency\u2019s investigations would be extended to \u201call persons reported with links to the Pandora Papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an ongoing, gradual process,\u201d the source said, asking not to be identified.",

They were not letting the lead slip this time.\n\nUnited were on the ropes and Leicester kept them there as King Power Stadium rocked in celebration.\n\nDaka\u2019s goal was the final decoration on an outstanding display, leaving manager Brendan Rodgers beaming after a spell when he was being asked questions of his own \u2013 ridiculous given the fact he brought the FA Cup to Leicester City last season.\n\nHe will hope this is lift-off for their season.\n\nManchester City Labour vs Burnley\n\nManchester City also defeated lowly-placed Burnley 2-0. It was a difficult victory for the homers despite two goals from Silva and De Bruyne.",

          "text": "\u2026..Expands scope of nonprofit Revolving Loan Scheme to women\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation NGO, under the auspices of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has called on government at all levels to end food insecurity through the empowerment of rural women.\n\nThe group also advocates the inclusion of indigenous women, in enhancing agricultural and rural development, and eradicating rural poverty.\n\nThe President and Founder of the NGO, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made the call in a statement on Friday as part of activities to mark 2021 International Day of Rural Women IDRW, which is marked every 15th Oct to celebrate rural women all over the world.\n\nShe said this year\u2019s International Day of Rural Women with the theme: Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All\u201d was in line with the ongoing programmes being carried out by the Helpline Foundation in recent times aimed at encouraging access to food and addressing hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\n\nDr. Ahmadu, while drawing the attention of the government at all levels to rural women\u2019s plights in Nigeria, added that providing training and empowerment for rural women was in line with Helpline Foundation\u2019s plans of cushioning hardships associated with their environment.\n\nAhmadu said: \u201cOct 15th is set aside for the marking of the IDRW, the essence of the event is to create awareness on the rural women and their plights in FCT and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that rural women and girls play essential roles in food systems in Nigeria\u2013 from production, to processing, preparation, consumption, and distribution of food \u2013 as well as in securing household and community nutrition. Yet, unequal power relations between women and men in the household and society, discriminatory gender norms and practices, prevalent violence against women and girls, and their disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, result in unequal access to food and heightened experience of hunger, malnutrition, undernutrition, and food insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year being Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All , was as a result of neglect to the rural women by the policymakers, as the government does not remember them. So this awareness creation will make the government remember them, because they have a lot at hand, including problems of the upbringing of their children, among other things they are helplessly tackling.\n\n\u201cIt will surprise you to know that in some communities, they are treated unfairly and there is nobody to assist them. So for that, we are beckoning on the government at all levels to consider the widows in their policy-making. We are appealing to all the governments to consider and include them in their budgets. If this our appeals are considered, it will go a long way.\u201d\n\nOn the part of the NGO, she said \u201d We have so far embarked on periodic training and empowerment to the rural women annually across some selected communities in the six area councils of the FCT and suburbs.\n\n\u201cWhy we train and empower them is to enable them to cope with the harsh economy all over the world. Some of the rural women organisation that benefited from our empowerment programmes includes Yeyedu women, Bwari women and Kurudu women.\n\n\u201cAlso the Foundation has given out the none-profit Revolving Loan Scheme for women in our rural communities ongoing for the past 7 years respectively, where over 1000 have benefitted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, they don\u2019t have anybody to assist them, and the only way out is to train and empower them. We have trained about 1000 of them and after that, we gave them starter packs and advised them to be industrious and prudent in the management of their resources.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the ongoing training, Mrs Maria Afiniki, confirmed that she learned a lot through the training and was also empowered, even as she tasked the government to support genuine NGOs to assist rural women.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe group is asking the court to \u201cdeclare illegal and unconstitutional the plan by the administration to track, intercept and monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, as it severely threatens and violates the right to the preservation of privacy.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the proposal in the Supplementary Appropriation Act signed in July 2021 to spend N4.87bn to monitor private calls and messages. The amount is part of the N895.8bn supplementary budget approved by the National Assembly.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1240/2021 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and any other authority, persons or group of persons from unlawfully monitoring the WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201ca declaration that any monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is oppressive and draconian, as it threatens and violates sections 37 and 39 of Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended]; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Abducted Emir Of Bungudu Regains Freedom\n\nAccording to the group, the plan to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is an arbitrary interference by the administration into respect for family and private life, the home, and correspondence.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights. Monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.\n\n\u201cPrivacy and expression are intertwined in the digital age, with online privacy serving as a gateway to secure exercise of the freedom of opinion and expression. Therefore, targets of surveillance would suffer interference with their rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression whether the effort to monitor is successful or not.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as respondents are the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) and the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cThe powers to conduct arbitrary, abusive or unlawful surveillance of communications may also be used to target political figures and activists, journalists and others in the discharge of their lawful activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\n\n\u201cThe lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights.\n\n\u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the right to freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy and correspondence, communications and private data.\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 19 of the Covenant also guarantee the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media.\n\n\u201cThe UN General Assembly has condemned unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and interception of communications as \u2018highly intrusive acts\u2019 that interfere with fundamental human rights (see General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 71/199).\n\n\u201cInterference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Surveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights.\n\n\u201cTargeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking the following reliefs:\n\nA declaration that monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is inconsistent with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality and amounts to threat and infringement on the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press guaranteed under sections 37 and 39 of Nigeria Constitution, 1999; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendants budgeting N4.87bn of public money to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is unlawful and a violation of the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press.\n\nAn order setting aside the budget line of N4.87bn to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people for being inconsistent and incompatible with constitutional provisions, and international human rights treaties.\n\nAn order mandating the 1st Respondent to redirect public funds in the sum of N4.87bn budgeted to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people to improve the working conditions of healthcare practitioners and improve public healthcare facilities across Nigeria.\n\nAnd for such further order or orders that the court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

The vast majority have recovered, though some have continued to experience symptoms weeks or even months later.\n\nThe figures are based on daily reports provided by health authorities in each country.\n\nThey exclude revisions made by other statistical organisations, which show that the number of deaths is much higher.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that the pandemic\u2019s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19.\n\nA large number of the less severe or asymptomatic cases also remain undetected, despite intensified testing in many countries.\n\nOn Thursday, 7,273 new deaths and 440,702 new cases were recorded worldwide.

          "text": "The Nigerian Air Force has denied allegations that it paid N20 million to armed bandits operating in Jibia Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State in return for an anti-aircraft gun reportedly captured by one of its soldiers.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of NAF Public Relations and Information Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet said that there is absolutely no iota of truth in the spurious allegation circulating on social media which is designed to cast aspersions on the good image of the Service.\n\nCommodore Gabkwet stated that the said report is totally false and should therefore be taken as fake news and disregarded.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe ordinarily would not have responded to such baseless and utterly illogical allegation but for the need to set the record straight as well as reaffirm the NAF\u2019s unflinching commitment to decisively dealing with the armed bandits and all other criminal elements in the Country in partnership with other services of the Armed Forces and other security Agencies.\n\n\u201d For the avoidance of doubt, it must be stated that there is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State, other parts of the North-West as well as other Theatres of Operation in the Country. Indeed, as recent as 12 October 2021 , NAF aircraft conducted 5 missions in the Jibia general area and engaged targets with rockets and cannons at Bala Wuta bandits\u2019 locations in Kadaoji. Similar successes were recorded at Fakai Dutsin Anfare, an area in Jibia LGA known for its high incidences of bandits\u2019 activities. The false reportage therefore, begs the question as to why the NAF would negotiate for a weapon allegedly seized and still carry out air interdiction missions on the same bandits and their strongholds. The NAF is of the view that, this latest false report could be a part of a campaign to further the cause of insecurity in Nigeria by elements who see the NAF as a threat following series of successful exploits in operations against criminal gangs.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, this provides an avenue for the NAF to yet again appeal to members of the media, both local and international, as well as social media, to be circumspect in their reportage and endeavour to always verify their facts before going public. The public is enjoined to disregard the falsehood emanating from some sections of the social and mainstream media. The NAF also uses this opportunity to call on citizens to continue to cooperate with security agencies as efforts are ongoing to rid the entire Nation of criminals and their activities.\n\n\u201cOn our part, the NAF, as a professional and disciplined force, will not in any way be discouraged from carrying out its mandate to rid the entire North-West Nigeria of banditry and other forms of criminality. We remain resolute in performing our function and will continue to work in synergy with other sister Services and security agencies to rid the Country of all criminal elements\u201d.",

          "text": "The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that half a million women, men, and children in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states are at risk of starvation as its funding for the region dries up.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the global agency, which seeks a $55 million urgent lifeline, said it might soon be forced to cut food rations except it secures urgent funds to continue its life-saving operations in the crisis hotspot.\n\nThe region has been a mainstay of insurgency attacks for over a decade and the situation has been worsened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising high food prices, the WFP said.\n\nThe UN agency also said the number of internally displaced persons surpassed two million in September.\n\n\u201cCutting rations means choosing who gets to eat and who goes to bed hungry. We are seeing funding for our life-saving humanitarian work dry up just at the time when hunger is at its most severe,\u201d said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s Regional Director for West Africa, following a recent visit to Nigeria.\n\nThe WFP director said that current food security analyses showed that 4.4 million people in the North-east did not know where their next meal would come from, adding that more than one million children were already malnourished.\n\nHe cited continued attacks on communities by non-state armed groups, harsh and lean season conditions amid an economy dealing with the fallout from the COVID-19, as portending great danger for the people.\n\nNikoi added that high food prices and a severe reduction in household purchasing power had also contributed to a bleak outlook for the most vulnerable people in the North-east, warning that despite increasing needs, WFP may soon be unable to sustain life-saving operations in the conflict-riddled region.\n\nHe stated that the cuts would come just as severe hunger reached a five-year high in the country, in the wake of years of conflict and insecurity, noting that the situation had been worsened by the socio-economic fallout from COVID-19, high food prices, and limited food supply.\n\nHe added that the number of internally displaced surpassed two million in September 2021, reaching another grim milestone.\n\nNikoi warned that if at least $ 55 million was not received in a matter of weeks, WFP would have no choice but to cut food rations and reduce the number of people it serves, where assistance is already prioritised for the most vulnerable as early as November.\n\nThe WFP, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2020, said it required at least $55 million in a matter of weeks to avoid cutting food aid.\n\n\u201cOur food assistance is a lifeline for millions whose lives have been upended by conflict and have almost nothing to survive on. We must act now to save lives and avoid disruptions to this lifeline,\u201d Nikoi added.\n\nHe said that the number of Internally Displaced People (IDP) forced to flee their homes in search of safety in the North-east had been rising steadily, reaching a new all-time high of over two million in September 2021.\n\nThe United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said cutting food assistance \u201cwill be a painful decision for humanitarians as it will negatively affect children, women, and men uprooted from their homes due to continued violence.\n\n\u201cAs we call upon our partners to step up their support in response to the growing needs, I would like to say thank you to those who have stood with us over the years in providing the much-needed humanitarian assistance in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to its statement, the WFP said it has \u201cprovided life-saving food and nutrition assistance to severely food insecure people, displaced families in camps, and to vulnerable people living in host communities thanks to generous contributions from Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and private donors.\n\n\u201cThis year, relying on the continued generosity of donor partners, WFP ramped up its response to address rising food insecurity and the impact of COVID-19, targeting 1.9 million displaced people in Nigeria with life-saving food assistance.\n\n\u201cTo sustain humanitarian operations in the North-east Nigeria until March 2022, WFP urgently requires $197 million.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "text": "The United Kingdom government has warned its citizens in Nigeria against visiting 12 states in the country over possible terror attacks.\n\nThe advisory from the UK through its Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) followed concerns on the possibility of terrorists carrying out attacks in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement published on its website \u201cstill current at October 16, 2021,\u201d it expressed concern over protests and a heightened security presence in major cities due to the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe foreign government also urged its citizens to monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.\n\nThe UK listed the Nigerian states as: Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara.\n\nOther states are: Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River.\n\nThe FCDO also advised against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto and Kogi aand within 20kilometres of the border with Niger in Kebbi State, and Abia State.\n\nIt also cautioned UK citizens against travelling to the non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states.\n\nAccording to the advisory, events to mark the one year anniversary of #EndSARS protests are likely to take place nationally, week commencing October 18.\n\n\u201cThere may be protests and a heightened security presence in major cities such as Lagos and Abuja. In parallel, the high profile trial date of a separatist leader is also scheduled for 21 October in Abuja. There may be additional protests and a heightened security presence in Abuja and in the South-east for this reason. In all areas affected, you should monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings,\u201d the advisory stated.\n\nFCDO noted that from September 3, 2021, the Nigerian government had mandated for all telecommunication operators in Nigeria to stop extending services to Zamfara State.\n\nThis, according to the FCDO, includes a suspension of all mobile telecommunications, including WiFi.\n\nIt added that a number of other state governments, including Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger had also implemented a partial shutdown of telecom services.\n\n\u201cSince 9 August, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South-east region of Nigeria. Protests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, are likely during October in the South-east region. There have been reports of violence during Sit-at-Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces,\u201d the advisory explained.\n\nIt noted a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South-east and South-south regions, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi.\n\nAccording to the FCDO, some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations.\n\nIt, however, added that there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas.\n\n\u201cThere is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews,\u201d the advisory added.\n\nEjiofor Alike",

          "text": "Melbourne, which has spent more time under COVID-19 lockdowns than any other city in the world, is set to lift its stay-at-home orders this week, officials said on Sunday.\n\nBy Friday, when some curbs will be lifted, the Australian city of 5 million people will have been under six lockdowns totalling 262 days, or nearly nine months, since March 2020.\n\nAustralian and other media say this is the longest in the world, exceeding a 234-day lockdown in Buenos Aires.\n\nWhile coronavirus cases keep rising in Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, the state\u2019s double-vaccination rate is set to reach 70% this week, allowing for the ease in restrictions.\n\n\u201cToday is a great day,\u201d said Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews in announcing the lockdown. \u201cToday is a day when Victorians can be proud of what they have achieved.\u201d\n\nWhen hospitality venues and some businesses reopen, their capacity will remain heavily restricted. More easing, including the reopening of many retailers, will come once 80% of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated \u2013 estimated by Nov. 5 at the latest.\n\nOn Sunday, Victoria recorded 1,838 new coronavirus cases and seven deaths. Neighbouring New South Wales, which emerged last week from a 100-day lockdown, reported 301 cases and 10 deaths. Eighty percent of the state\u2019s people have been fully vaccinated.\n\nAustralia, once a champion of a COVID-zero strategy of managing the pandemic, has been moving towards living with the virus through extensive vaccinations, as the Delta variant has proven too transmissible to suppress.\n\nThe new strategy makes lockdowns highly unlikely once 80% of the population is fully vaccinated. As of the weekend, around 68% of eligible Australians have been fully inoculated.\n\nAustralia\u2019s health officials said on Sunday that quarantine-free travel from New Zealand\u2019s South Island, where there is no outbreak, will resume on Wednesday. The government is also in discussions with Singapore about reopening travel between the two countries for the fully vaccinated.\n\nDespite the rise in cases in recent months, Australia\u2019s coronavirus numbers are low compared to many other developed countries, with just over 143,000 cases and 1,530 deaths.\n\nNeighbouring New Zealand, which is also learning to live with COVID-19 by accelerating inoculations, reported 51 new cases on Sunday, 47 of them in the largest city Auckland, which has been in a lockdown since mid-August.\n\nOn Saturday, New Zealand vaccinated more than 2.5% of its people as part of a government-led mass vaccination drive.",
