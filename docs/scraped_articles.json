          "text": "The US Senate will vote Wednesday on a national abortion rights bill \u2014 a process likely doomed to fail \u2014 after a leaked draft decision signalled the Supreme Court\u2019s readiness to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade decision.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has called the draft ruling an \u201cabomination,\u201d said he has teed up the vote on codifying the right to abortion in America, which the conservative-majority court appears poised to ban.\n\nThe prospects of success are virtually zero, given the blocking power of Republicans in an evenly divided 100-seat Senate where key legislation almost always faces a 60-vote threshold.\n\nBut the vote will nonetheless put lawmakers on record regarding one of the country\u2019s most divisive issues, and Democrats hope the debate will galvanize voters to go to the polls in the midterm elections exactly six months from Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe will vote on Wednesday, and every American will see how every senator stands. They can\u2019t duck it anymore,\u201d Schumer said at a press conference Sunday in New York.\n\n\u201cNow they have to show which side they\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nRepublican-controlled states have taken steps to restrict abortion rights in recent months, given that overturning Roe v Wade would give states the ability to make their own laws on abortion.\n\nTop congressional Democrat Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, reiterated her outrage about the court\u2019s upcoming likely decision, telling CBS News on Sunday that \u201cthe court has slapped women in the face in terms of disrespect for their judgments about the size and timing of their families.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats lacking the necessary majority to push through codification, the only other option would appear to be changing Senate rules to lower the number of votes required to pass such a bill.\n\nBut Republicans \u2013 and a few senators in President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic Party \u2013 oppose such a move.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand said \u201cwe will never give in\u201d to Republican efforts to roll back abortion rights protections.\n\n\u201cWe are half-citizens under this ruling,\u201d she told CNN, referring to the draft opinion. \u201cAnd if this is put into law, it changes the foundation of America.\u201d\n\nSeveral conservative states are already shifting.\n\nThe southern state of Mississippi will ban abortion except in cases of rape or incest, or danger to the life of the mother, Republican Governor Tate Reeves told NBC Sunday.\n\nBut looking forward, \u201cwe must prove that being pro-life is not just about anti-abortion,\u201d Reeves said, by making sure expectant mothers and newborns have the resources they need.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said the Roe decision has sown division for decades because it \u201ccreated a constitutional right that doesn\u2019t exist in the written constitution.\u201d\n\nNow, he told Fox News, \u201cfinally elected officials have a say about life and the conditions of abortion. I think that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nAccording to a poll released Friday by the Pew Research Center, about 61 percent of Americans believe abortion should remain legal in all or most circumstances.\n\nBut, as with so many other social issues, the gap between Democrats and Republicans is wide, and growing wider. Eight in 10 Democrats support abortion rights in all or most cases, more than double the 38 percent of Republicans who do, Pew said.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) has released nine guidelines for the conduct of presidential, governorship and parliamentary aspirants ahead of primaries.\n\nThe contenders have been barred from going to court without first exhausting avenues for redress and ventilation of grievances.\n\nThe aspirants are also expected to sign undertakings to accept the outcomes of the shadow polls and support whoever emerges as a candidate for the general election.\n\nThe ruling party also directed them to take oaths not to engage in thuggery, anti-party activities, factionalisation or the creation of parallel congresses and party organs at any level.\n\nThese conditions are contained on page 17 of the nomination form given to the aspirants.\n\nBut of the nine conditions, most of the aspirants, especially presidential heavyweights, are uncomfortable with the \u201cvoluntary letter of withdrawal\u201d, which they are expected to sign before a Commissioner for Oaths or a Notary Public.\n\nThey alleged that the withdrawal clause may lead to either imposition of a presidential candidate or abuse of the consensus clause in the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIt was learnt that most presidential aspirants have been seeking legal advice on Page 18 of the nomination form, which they considered a booby trap.\n\nA copy of the nomination form revealed the tough terms for aspirants who have paid humongous sums to participate in the primaries.\n\nAlthough APC leadership claimed that the conditions were in line with Article 21. 2 (i \u2014 xii) of the APC Constitution, many aspirants faulted the conditions as inconsistent with fundamental human rights as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe conditions are: \u201cAbide to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the APC and the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAbide by the Primary election guidelines of APC and Nigerian Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cAbide to place APC above selfish interests,\n\n\u201cI, my primary campaign organisation and my supporters undertake to accept the outcome of the primary and support whoever emerges as APC candidate for the general election.\n\n\u201cAbide not to engage in dishonest practices, thuggery, being absent from meetings to which he/she is invited without reasonable cause; carrying out anti-party activities which tend to disrupt the peaceful, lawful and efficient organisation of the party or which are inconsistent with the aims and objectives of the party.\n\n\u201cAbide not to give wrong information to any organ of the party or unauthorised publicity of a party dispute without exhausting all avenues or settlement or redress within the party.\n\n\u201cAbide not to file any action in a court of law against the party or any of its officers on any matters relating to the discharge of the duties of the party without first exhausting all avenues for redress provided.\n\n\u201cAbide to always follow the path of justice, honesty and unity amongst fellow contestants and party members. So help me God.\n\n\u201cAbide not to factionalise or create a parallel congress, election, or party organ at any level.\u201d\n\nThe aspirants, especially presidential contenders, have picked holes in Page 18 of the nomination form bordering on signing a voluntary letter of withdrawal before participating in the forthcoming exercise.\n\nThe letter, titled: Letter of Voluntary Withdrawal, says: \u201cI\u2026of the above address\u2026vying for\u2026hereby voluntarily withdraw my candidacy from the contest\u2026scheduled to hold on\u20262023. My withdrawal is in the best interest of our great party, the APC.\u201d\n\nApart from addressing the letter to the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, each aspirant is expected to endorse the letter before a Commissioner for Oaths or Notary Public.\n\nIt was learnt that most aspirants were shocked by the attachment to the party\u2019s nomination form.\n\nA source said: \u201cMost of the aspirants see it as a death warrant. The party can invoke the letter to disengage an aspirant from participating in any strand of the primaries.\n\n\u201cAlso, it gives the party the liberty to impose a candidate at any level under the guise of abiding by the consensus clause in the Electoral Act 2022. With the letter, the conditions for consensus will easily be met.\n\n\u201cTechnically, many aspirants see the letter as leaving their fate to the party. Other conditions have also boxed them into a tight corner. We have never had these draconian guidelines.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that some aspirants have opted for legal advice on whether or not to sign the letter of withdrawal.\n\nAn aide to a presidential aspirant said: \u201cOur legal team, like those of others, is studying the implications of the letter.\n\n\u201cI am aware that presidential aspirants have been comparing notes on the letter, which is unacceptable to them.\n\n\u201cAlthough the party said the signing of the letter is optional, an aspirant will be submitting an incomplete nomination form without completing the letter. Such an aspirant can be disqualified. It is a tight situation.\n\n\u201cNone of the presidential aspirants has been able to submit his or her nomination form because of this letter of withdrawal.\n\n\u201cThough the aspirants have up till May 11 to submit the form, they are making representation to the party leadership to have a rethink.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*In apparent double standard, activists, Akeredolu, PDP, Tambuwal, Ezekwesili, others keep mum as Adesina fails to resign after his proxies purchased forms for him\n\n*Action Alliance, group fault calls for Emefiele\u2019s sack\n\n*Insist CBN governor has not breached any law\n\n\n\nGoddy Egene in Lagos, Sunday Aborisade and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nSome African leaders have mounted pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to anoint President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election, THISDAY learnt at the weekend.\n\n\n\nA reliable source told THISDAY that leaders in West Africa, including the presidents of Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, might have spoken to Buhari on behalf of the AfDB president. The West African leaders are meeting Buhari in Abidjan today and tomorrow, at a two-day conference organised by the United Nations, on the future of land, regarding desertification, drought, degradation, rights, restoration and implications for national and world economies.. Their mission? To try and persuade him to consider Adesina. This, it was gathered, was what encouraged a coalition of support groups to purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms for the president of the continental bank.\n\n\n\nHowever, analysts described as double standard the calls on Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to resign over the purchase of the N100 million APC nomination and expression of interest forms on his behalf by his supporters, while keeping mum on the purchase of the forms for Adesina.\n\n\n\nThe analysts specifically accused the Governors of Ondo and Sokoto States, Rotimi Akeredolu and Aminu Tambuwal; the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Oby Ezekwesili, and other activists who have been calling on Emefiele to resign, without demanding same from Adesina who superintends over a continental bank.\n\n\u201cThe APC forms have been purchased for Adesina, why are they not calling for his resignation as well?\u201d the analyst who pleaded to remain anonymous wondered.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu had while reacting to the purchase of the N100 million All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination and expression of interest forms on behalf of Emefiele for the 2023 presidential election, last Friday, said the CBN Governor should resign his position or be sacked.\n\n\n\nOn her part, Nigeria\u2019s former Minister of Education, Ezekwesili as well as some activist on Twitter and other social media platforms had also called on Emefiele to resign.\n\nThree different groups, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Friends of Emefiele and Emefiele Support Group, had last week, purchased the forms for Emefiele.\n\n\n\nThey noted that the apex bank\u2019s boss was the only responsible and responsive person to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari at the 2023 general elections, hence their decision to purchase the forms for him.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of Action Alliance (AA), Kenneth Udeze, has disagreed with Akeredolu, over his call for the sack of Emefiele.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, the Ideas Nigeria Movement (INM), a group of Nigerians with focus on national unity, innovation and capacity also described as baseless, calls by various persons and associations for Emefiele to resign his position.\n\n\n\nResponding to the calls for the CBN governor to vacate his position, Udeze, in a statement yesterday, in Abuja, alleged that Akeredolu\u2019s anger against Emefiele was beyond the issue of the purchase of form.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany participants and watchers of the democratic space must have been taken aback by the speed and audacity at which the Ondo State Governor came down hard on Emefiele.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is more surprising that Akeredolu spoke at a time when Emefiele has not even come out to declare that he has interest and he will be running.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the groups that felt that the CBN Governor will do well as the president purchased forms for him but he has not made any declaration.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, Nigerians will naturally want to ask the Ondo Governor on which basis is he asking for Emefiele\u2019s sacking?\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cFor the discerning minds, Akeredolu\u2019s call is beyond politics or national interest. It is purely personal.\n\n\u201cI am however advising Nigerians to beware of desperate politicians who will be presenting their personal interests as national interest as we move closer to the general election.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a related development, the INM, in a statement issued by its Executive Secretary, Mallam Nadodo Abubakar, yesterday, stressed that Emefiele has not breached any law, especially the constitution, hence should not resign.\n\nThe INM wondered why some persons were still calling on Emefiele to resign even when he had rejected the form and was yet to declare his intent to run, stressing that, \u201cEmefiele as at today has not breached any extant law of the land.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe statement added: \u201cEven by his own admission, the CBN Governor has not formerly declared his intent to contest for the Presidential ticket of any party, yet certain persons are already calling for his head or his resignation while some are threatening to shut down the nation through protests.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe dare say that these reactions are baseless, ultra vires and of no effect as they are based on hearsay and the actions of some Nigerians (not Emefiele) who are working at convincing Emefiele to join the presidential race.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore wrong and unjustifiable for critics of Emefiele to continue to demand for his resignation when the man, himself, has not officially declared his intention to run.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe admit that several groups including professional bodies have since mounted pressure on Emefiele to contest the Presidency, such persuasions were only vicarious and do not represent his opinion or intendment. Even so, these groups were only persuading Mr. Emefiele to exercise his constitutional rights and liberties.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the INM faulted critics who were referencing the Public Service Rules, CBN Act and the 1999 Constitution to advance their argument, adding that quoting laws would not be enough, but showing proof of how his \u201caction or inaction offends any of the statutes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is clear on the matter of who should resign and when to resign in the case of appointees seeking election to political offices. While ruling on the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State capital, held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution. \u201cThis ruling renders nugatory any other law, rule or Act of Parliament stipulating that appointees must resign ahead of the primary elections of their preferred party.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven if we assume, though not conceding, that Emefiele is running, he has not contravened any of the afore-listed canons often quoted by his traducers. For the avoidance of doubt, Emefiele has not breached any law.\n\n\u201cHe has not shown any partisanship, neither has he mounted any rostrum nor undertaken any tour across the land to woo delegates of any political party.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery perceived political activity being linked to Emefiele was done by different groups who merely made persuasive efforts to compel him to run for Presidency on account of his antecedents as someone who believes in promoting a production economy as opposed to a consumption economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is no brainer that Emefiele remains the best CBN governor who has genuinely placed the nation on the path of economic diversification through a revolutionary turnaround of the agriculture ecosystem. Little wonder, farmers were the ones who enthusiastically purchased Form on his behalf but which he has rejected, according to his tweet.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe reaffirm that Emefiele should not resign because he has not flouted any law. We recall that the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia has effectively struck out Section 84(12) of the newly amended Electoral Act,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\n\nThe group stressed that it was \u201cshocked that a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, should join the anti-Emefiele mob to demand for his resignation based on blatant falsehood and hearsay.\n\n\n\n\u201cEmefiele has openly told the world that he has not consented to the request of some patriots especially Nigerian farmers to run but would rather prefer to be Divinely guided on the matter, which he referred to as a \u2018serious decision.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe urge Emefiele to stay focused on the good job he is doing at CBN where he has guided the nation\u2019s economy out of two recessions, navigated the economic landmines of Covid-19 pandemic which consumed stronger economies in the advanced West,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCoalition: N100m Presidential Form Purchased But Adesina Not Persuaded\n\nMeanwhile, the coalition of support groups that purchased the presidential nomination form for President of the African Development Bank, Akinwunmi Adesina, has lamented that it has not been able to convince him to contest the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary election.\n\n\n\nAt the weekend, the coalition of 28 support groups had paid for his presidential nomination form.\n\nWhile addressing journalists in Abuja, yesterday, the President of One Nigeria Group, Mohammed Saleh, said their quest to seek a solution to the myriad of challenges confronting the country informed their decision to drag him into the race.\n\n\n\nHe described Adesina as a man of proven integrity and experience, saying he performed well for Nigeria as Minister for Agriculture.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has solved the problems of so many farmers, created so many jobs by solving the corruption in the agricultural sector. Particularly the fertilizer, which he brought the e-wallet for fertilizer which the farmers are enjoying now, and it has created a lot of jobs,\u201d Saleh explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has also helped millions of farmers in Nigeria, which they are still benefiting from and also as president of African Development Bank, he has brought a lot of initiatives that solve Africa\u2019s food security problem. So, we will like him to come back home and apply it here in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn how Adesina would woo delegates to vote for him, he noted that the most important thing for the group now was to get Adesina to agree to join the race.\n\n\u201cWhen we get there, we\u2019ll cross that bridge, don\u2019t worry about that. First and foremost, the most significant thing is for us to get him to agree and come and collect the form, sign it for us and then join the race. That is the most significant thing at the moment,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cIssues of delegates and everybody I know all Nigerians apart from not even the delegates even you, everybody in Nigeria knows that Adesina has the capacity to bring Nigeria back from the brink.\u201d\n\nAlso, the leader and founder of the Youth Arise Movement, Babatunde Ademola, said he was one of the group leaders working tirelessly and consulting across the country and even outside the country to ensure that they get him to come and obey the clarion call.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will tell you significantly that we have tried to reach out to him. We have sent messages. We have not gotten any definite response from him,\u201d explained Ademola. \u201cWe need Dr Adesina to come and solve Nigeria\u2019s problem, and because of this, we have put our resources together.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to gather N100 million, but we have ensured that we gather as many people as possible. So we are calling him to come out and accept this form from us,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIs a gift to serve this country and solve our problems. We are calling Adesina because it\u2019s a call to save Nigeria, and I think he is going to accept.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Maverick Politician and a multi-billion naira investment mogul, Chief Arthur Nzeribe is dead.\n\nAlthough details of how he died had remained sketchy at the time of report, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Nzeribe would have been 84 years by Nov. 2.\n\nA NAN Correspondent, who visited his palatial country home known as \u2018Haven of Peace\u2019, located at Egbuoma community in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo, reports that only a security guard was seen at the vicinity.\n\nHowever, at his father\u2019s compound in Umudei village in the same council area, a man, Mr Justinian Nzeribe, who identified himself as the only surviving child of eight Nzeribe siblings, confirmed the death of the icon.\n\nMr Justinian said he received the sad news at about 6:00 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard it, I summoned courage and took it as a rumour until around 12 noon when the traditional ruler of Oguta summoned me to break the news.\n\n\u201cHe has been sick for years of stroke.\n\n\u201cHe was a simple man. Despite being great, he would always ask you to stay out of trouble.\n\n\u201cHe was a champion of peace and an icon of my time, who left a lot of legacies behind, both political and his life style,\u201d he said.\n\nThe traditional ruler of Oguta, HRM Eze Nnani Chinedu Nzeribe as well as a political associate of the late icon and former deputy governor of the state, Mr Gerald Irona, said they would only speak after an official statement by family members.\n\nNzeribe was born in Oguta on Nov. 2, 1938. His father, Oyimba Nzeribe, was a lawyer and former state counsel, and his grandfather, Akpati Nzeribe, held the traditional title of Ogbuagu, Oshiji, Damanze Oyimba of Oguta.\n\nHis second wife is the sister of Hajia Asabe Yar\u2019Adua, wife of the late General Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua, who was brother of late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nNzeribe lost his mother when he was a primary school pupil, while his father was away in Great Britain studying law.\n\nHis care was taken over by Catholic priests, who were involved in furthering his education.\n\nHe attended Bishop Shanahan College, Orlu and Holy Ghost College, Owerri. In 1957, he traveled to Lagos where he obtained employment with Nigeria\u2019s Port Authority (NPA) as an engineering cadet.\n\nA year later, he received a scholarship from the NPA to study marine engineering. He took courses at Portsmouth College of Technology and later attended Chesterfield College of Technology in England.\n\nBy 1960, he was selling life insurance to black immigrants in Britain. Returning to Nigeria in 1961, he was briefly an employee of Shell, then for a few months an Air Force cadet.

          "text": "\n\n*PDP panics, makes accusations without evidence\n\n*CBN gov has not broken any law, northern coalitions insist, tackle Akeredolu\n\n*Coalition picks APC nomination forms for AfDB president, Adesina\n\n\n\nFestus Akanbi, Ejiofor Alike in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said he would decide in the next few days on the pressure being mounted on him to contest the 2023 presidential race.\n\n\n\nThe apex bank governor has also rejected the presidential nomination and Expression of Interest (EoI) forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC) procured for him by some farmers across the country. Emefiele who acknowledged the enormous pressure being mounted on him to throw his hat into the 2023 presidential ring, further clarified that he would make up his mind on the issue in the next few days.\n\n\n\nEmefiele\u2019s decision to decide in a few days has created panic in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the main opposition party yesterday made unfounded allegations against the apex bank\u2019s governor.\n\nAs the deadline for the purchase of the APC presidential forms expires on Tuesday, May 10, former President Goodluck Jonathan has also come under last-minute pressure to throw his hat into the presidential ring on the platform of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and former Minister of Agriculture, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, has however collected his nomination and EoI forms to vie for the APC presidential ticket.\n\nThis is coming as a Coalition of North-Central Youths Vanguard for Emefiele has said that the apex bank governor has not broken any law.\n\n\n\nThe Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum (UNNYF), one of the groups calling on Emefiele to contest for the 2023 Presidency, has also condemned the call by the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, for Emefiele to resign.\n\nThe group reminded the Ondo State governor that \u201cthere is no provision in the Nigerian Constitution stopping Emefiele from seeking election into the office of the president while in office, provided he has not been disqualified by Section 137.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn rejecting the forms procured for him by farmers, Emefiele said that should he decide to join the presidential race, he would use his hard-earned savings from his banking career to purchase the forms.\n\nThe CBN governor, in a series of Tweets, disclosed that he hasn\u2019t decided on whether to throw his hat into the ring or not.\n\nHe also revealed that he prefers to pay for his forms from the proceeds of his savings whenever he makes up his mind.\n\nThe Twitter message read: \u201cI am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the Office of President in the 2023 general election: I have not come to that decision. I note and salute the sacrifices of those farmers and patriots going as far as raising personal funds and offering me presidential nomination forms: I thank them most profusely.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, should I answer their calls and decide to seek presidential nomination, I will use my own hard-earned savings from over 35 years of banking leadership to buy my nomination forms, without proxies in an open and transparent manner in full compliance with the laws and Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd should I not run for elected office, I will continue to serve and sacrifice for the good people of Nigeria under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is a serious decision that requires God\u2019s Divine intervention: In the next few days The Almighty will so direct.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmefiele\u2019s pronouncement has already created panic in PDP even when he has not decided to contest. National Publicity Secretary of the of the party, Mr. Debo Ologunagba told journalists in Abuja yesterday that the decision of the CBN governor to contest will bring untold hardship and crippling effect on the already fragile economy and loss of confidence on the economy by international investors.\n\n\n\nA coalition of rice farmers and other crop growers had on Friday moved to drag the governor of the apex bank into the 2023 presidential race by purchasing the N100 million APC\u2019s Presidential EoI and Nomination forms for him. Expressing the reason for their push for Emefiele, the farmers said the CBN governor as the head of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, \u201chas shown capacity, focus, courage and worked tirelessly with the economic team of President Muhammadu Buhari to keep the economy of our great country afloat above recession and outright collapse.\u201d\n\n\n\nReacting to the controversy trailing the purchase of the APC forms for Emefiele by the farmers, a Coalition of North-Central Youths Vanguard for Emefiele yesterday declared that the CBN governor has not broken any law.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Coalition, Ameenah Hayatudeen, said the group was aware of the provisions of Section 9 of the CBN Act, which states that: \u201cthe Governor and the Deputy Governor shall devote the whole of their time to the service of the Bank and while holding office shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation whether remunerated or not except such personal and charitable causes as may be determined by the Board and which do not conflict with or detract from their full-time duties\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nIt noted that based on the above provision, the CBN Governor or Deputy Governor cannot be involved in any other employment or vocation while in office.\n\nIt stated: \u201cArising from this, therefore, how do we define employment or vocation? In the case of Shell Petroleum Company of Nigeria vs Federal Board of Inland Revenue 1996 8 NWLR Part 466 256, the Supreme Court held that where the words of a statute are plain, precise and unambiguous, then it should be given the ordinary and natural meaning,\u201d the group explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe make bold to ask then from Emefiele\u2019s traducers what then is the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018employment\u2019? And what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018vocation\u2019?\u201d the group queried.\n\nThe group explained that employment means \u2018the state of having paid work,\u2019 while \u2018vocation means a person\u2019s employment or main occupation\u2019. It added: \u201cBased on these definitions above, can it then be said that seeking election into the office of the president of Nigeria is an employment or vocation? The answer must surely be negative. Anything other than that will be the most artificial interpretation to suit a sinister purpose.\n\nThe group argued that contesting for the position of the president is an exercise of constitutional rights and not an engagement in any employment or vocation.\n\nOn its part, UNNYF, one of the groups calling on Emefiele to contest has condemned Akeredolu\u2019s call for him to resign.\n\n\n\nUNNYF in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna accused the governor and \u201csponsored people\u201d of trying to undermine the credibility of the CBN governor \u201cwho has yet to yield to numerous calls to contest for the presidency.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by the Convener of the group, Mohammed Danlami, maintained that \u201cthere is no provision in the Nigerian Constitution stopping Emefiele from seeking election into the office of the president while in office, provided he has not been disqualified by Section 137.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are particularly disappointed with the position of Governor Akeredolu who should know better than power must rotate among all regions of Nigeria for equity, fairness and equal opportunities.\n\nAccording to the group, since 23 years of the current democratic dispensation, the South-west with just six states had produced the president for eight years, a vice president for eight years and two speakers of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nThe group challenged the Ondo State governor to approach a competent court to challenge the CBN governor if he feels bothered about his candidacy.\n\nIt said the calls for Emefiele to resign stemmed from the deliberate misinterpretation of Section 9 of the CBN Act.\n\nThe group called on others who had called for the resignation of the CBN governor to tell their sponsors that such a call was dead on arrival.\n\nEthnic Youth Leaders Fault Sagay over Emefiele\n\n\n\nIn a related development, a group of ethnic youth leaders in Nigeria has condemned the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Prof. Itse Sagay, for opposing the calls on Emefiele to contest the presidency.\n\nThe group under the aegis of the Nigerian Ethnic Youths Leaders Council (NEYLC) wondered why a senior lawyer, \u201cwill throw caution into the wind and begin to make public statements that are capable of undermining the political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NEYLC is made up of the Arewa Consultative Youths Movement (ACYM), Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youths.\n\nThe group\u2019s position was contained in a statement by the Ohanaeze youths\u2019 Secretary-General and Head of the coalition\u2019s secretariat, Nwada Ike Chiamaka.\n\n\u201cTalking magisterially on a decision that can only be taken by party delegates (which he is not among) only portrays Prof. Sagay as a meddlesome interloper in this matter,\u201d the groups said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of 28 groups consisting of Youth Arise Movement, Nigerians in Diaspora One Nigeria Group, Prudent Youth Association of Nigeria, women groups, farmers, people with disabilities and other civil society groups, has raised the N100 million fee to purchase the APC forms for the former minister, Adesina. The coalition is led by the Head, of One Nigeria Group, Mr Mohammed Saleh.\n\nJonathan under Last-minute Pressure to Declare for 2023 Presidency\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as the deadline for the purchase of the APC\u2019s presidential forms expires on Tuesday, May 10, former President Goodluck Jonathan has come under last-minute pressure to throw his hat into the presidential ring on the platform of the ruling party. Investigation however revealed that Jonathan has delayed his decision due to the clamour by the South-east to produce the next president and the large number of aspirants in the APC.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that some northern leaders, including emirs and APC chieftains from the region, intensified pressure on the former president following his recent public pronouncement that he was considering the call by his supporters to contest the next presidential election.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some of these APC chieftains also sent emissaries to him in Rivers State yesterday where he attended the burial ceremony of one of the policemen in his security team.\n\nThe policeman, who died after a protracted illness, was said to have been with the former president since his days as the deputy governor of Bayelsa State.\n\n\n\nA source close to Jonathan told THISDAY last night that the former president has not made up his mind because of the large number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC and the agitation by the South-east to produce the next president.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is under intense pressure by some northern leaders and emirs who have insisted that he is the only one that can stabilise the country at this point. But two issues are delaying his decision. One, he is not comfortable with the large number of people that have purchased the presidential forms in APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe believes that a large number of aspirants will make it difficult for the party to reach a consensus and he doesn\u2019t want to come out and be ridiculed. He wants to be the consensus candidate. Again, he is concerned about the popular demand for South-east presidency. He doesn\u2019t want to contest against the South-east because of the massive support the region gave him in his previous aspirations.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe believes that even if he emerges as the consensus candidate of APC, it will be morally wrong for him to contest against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate if the party\u2019s candidate emerges from the South-east,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nThe source also revealed that the extension of the sale of forms to May 10 (Tuesday) by the ruling party was part of the strategy to give Jonathan more time to conclude consultations and make up his mind.\n\nThose rooting for Jonathan want the power to return to the North after four years because he has only one term to complete the maximum two tenures of four years each.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nBarring any last-minute change of schedules, the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will on Wednesday meet to decide on the report of its 37-man committee headed by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State.\n\nThe committee had recommended that the party should throw open the presidential ticket of the party to all interested party members.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as an elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai has urged the main opposition party to adhere to the principle of zoning and zone its presidential ticket to the South-east for the sake of equity and stability.\n\nDespite the clamour for a power shift to the South, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim and the Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal yesterday intensified consultations on their presidential ambition, lamenting that the current administration led by APC has shattered the hopes of Nigerians.\n\n\n\nThis is just as the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, urged the ruling party to fix the universities and end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) with the huge funds generated from the sale of its presidential nomination forms.\n\n\n\nThe PDP NEC had in its meeting set up a 37-man committee to discuss and advise the party on where to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBefore the submission of the report to NEC, the report, which recommended that all the geo-political zones should be allowed to run, was leaked to the media.\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Chairman of the committee, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu submitted the committee\u2019s report on behalf of Ortom.\n\nIn their separate comments, the National Chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu and Elumelu had stated that only the NEC of the party would have the final say on the vexed issue of zoning after debating the outcome of the committee\u2019s report.\n\n\n\nAyu promised that the committee\u2019s recommendations would be transmitted to the NEC, which would take a final decision.\n\nAccording to him, the decision would be made known to \u201cparty members across the country and all Nigerians who are eagerly awaiting the final decision of your committee.\u201d\n\n\n\nSources close to the 37-man committee had stated that the party\u2019s leadership was more interested in how to win the presidential election than zoning of the presidency which might hamper their effort to regain power in 2023.\n\nHowever, the governors of the party from the South rose from their meeting in April, insisting that the presidential ticket of the party must be zoned to the South.\n\n\n\nThe NEC meeting after suffering several adjustments is expected to hold on Wednesday to bring the issue to rest. This was confirmed by the National Secretary of PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu.\n\nHe said that the earlier shift was due to the local government delegate election.\n\nZone Presidential Ticket to South-east for Stability, Equity, Yakassai tells PDP\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the 97-year-old Yakassai has urged the PDP to zone its presidential ticket to the South for the sake of stability and justice.\n\nHe also that the APC has no reason not to zone its presidential ticket to the South as the Presidency of Muhammadu Buhari comes to an end by 2023 having been elected in 2015.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe presidential ticket of the APC is expected to rotate between North and South.\u201d\n\nTanko Yakassai said: \u201cThough the timing is not ripe now as the PDP could have decided the zoning of its presidential ticket at least six months before now, for equity and stability of the country, the PDP should zone its presidential ticket to the zone that has not produced it since the return to democracy after several years of military rule.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy advice to the PDP as the party meets on Wednesday to discuss where the presidential ticket of the party will come from, I think that much as the timing is late, the party should listen to the voice of reason and give the South-east that opportunity. This will help reduce the tension in the country and help stabilise the country. We are in real danger over this agitation to shift power to the South,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\nHe described the support of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) for the North to retain power as a harbinger of crisis, insisting that it is not the fault of anybody that the north presented an incompetent person for the presidency in 2015.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom 2015 to 2023, the presidency of the country would have stayed in the North and therefore for equity and stability power should shift to the south and in fact to the geopolitical zone that have not have it since the return of democracy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Yakassai, \u201cthe APC is duty-bound to ensure that power shifts to the South.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the PDP, it is not the party in power, but for the stability and giving a sense of belonging, I would support that it is zoned to the South and in the South-east in particular. This will help to heal the wounds of the nation as was the case in 1999 went the country was bleeding as the result of the June 12 agitation\u201d\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, Anyim Intensify Consultations, Say Apc as Shattered\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku has lamented that Nigeria has never been this divided before, and vowed to restore the unity of Nigeria if voted to power in 2023.\n\nThe former vice president stated this when he met with delegates of the PDP in Ogun State at the party secretariat in Abeokuta, the state capital.\n\n\n\nAtiku noted that Nigeria must be rescued from the APC-led administration which he said has led the country into failure, following poor economy, insecurity and ethnic clashes.\n\nHe, however, promised not to fail Nigerians, saying APC has not been fair to all parts of this country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise to unify this country. I promise to give a sense of belonging to every part of this country. We have done it before in 1999 when we came, there was a lot of disunities, but it was not as bad as this,\u201d Atiku explained.\n\nTambuwal and Anyim also took their consultations to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party and Kogi State, respectively.\n\n\n\nTambuwal told the PDP NWC that if allowed to become the presidential candidate in the 2023 presidential election he will rescue Nigeria from becoming a failed state.\n\nIn the same manner, Anyim told the Kogi State delegates that if given the opportunity that he will revive the Ajaokuta Steel Mill to make the economy rebound.\n\n\n\nAccording to Tambuwal, who met the PDP NWC to present his manifesto, \u201cwe are all in agreement; that is what I can call consensus, that we are facing greater dangers that we\u2019ve never faced before. Our country has been divided as never before. Our economy is in shambles. The security ravaging the country has never been this bad.\n\nThe general summation of the situation of the country is that we are inching towards a failed state. I\u2019m not saying that Nigeria is already a failed state, but we\u2019re inching towards that.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Anyim pledged to restore the economy and improve the security situation in the country if he emerges the president in 2023.\n\n\n\nHe also unveiled his agenda to revitalise the economy and revive the moribund Ajaokuta Steel Company which is almost over 90 per cent near completion\n\nAnyim said that apart from reviving the Ajaokuta Steel Company that he will also provide purposeful political leadership that will move the country forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy pedigree as a former Senate President and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation has positioned and given me the political capacity to move the country forward,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his response on behalf of the party\u2019s NWC, the National Chairman of the PDP, Ayu, promised a transparent and fair presidential primary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gbenga Adebayo, chairman, Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators (ALTON), has asked the federal government to remove \u201cnuisance taxes\u201d placed on operators in the sector.\n\nNuisance tax is a tax imposed as a percentage of the selling price of goods or services, payable by the customer and transmitted by the seller to the taxing authority.\n\nAdebayo said this on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme on Monday.\n\nLast week, TheCable reported that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the collection of five per cent excise duty on telephone recharge cards and vouchers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new 5 per cent duty would add to some of the taxes levied on telcos in the country, including tertiary education tax, companies income tax, value-added tax, right of way charges, annual operating levy, among others.\n\nSpeaking on the levies, Adebayo said operators faced about 36 levies and taxes, and an additional 5 per cent duty on recharge cards would take effect on June 1.\n\n\u201cThe behaviour of government is not helping things for anyone.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya.

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nLast Saturday, I saw Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. And the Scarlet Witch\u2019s \u2014 Wanda Maximoff \u2014 desire reminds me of how far we can go to accomplish something if our desires or interests are strong enough.\n\nEven though desires or dreams are important, action is even more crucial because they make our dreams a reality. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you\u2019ll know that Wanda worked hard to make her dream a reality \u2014 or not.\n\nSo, let\u2019s act! Yes, I understand the importance of money. However, in some cases, you can start with the resources you have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may be doing something, and it appears that the world isn\u2019t paying attention \u2014 which can be discouraging \u2014 but believe me when I say that the world is. The universe is taking notice, and if you remain consistent, your efforts will be rewarded. So, this week, do more and speak less.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFred Agbata\u2019s appointment in South-East Nigeria\n\nIncrease in call, data and SMS rates\n\nWhatsApp\u2019s new features\n\nFred Agbata\u2019s appointment in South-East Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Governor of Anambra State in Nigeria, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, recently announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year term.\n\nWhat will he be doing? He\u2019s expected to use his experience to assist the government in realising its plans to build a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and helping state-based technology startups.\n\nWhy? Agbata has over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in various roles in the media and startup space, which he believes will serve him well as he embarks on a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIs this possible? For more information, click here: Can Anambra State spearhead a digital revolution in South-East Nigeria with Fred Agbata\u2019s appointment?\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nIncrease in call, data and SMS rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelecom companies, under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), have proposed an increase in call, data and SMS tariffs.\n\nWhat does this mean for Nigerians? Essentially, Airtel, MTN, Glo, and 9mobile customers should expect a 40% increase in call and SMS rates.\n\nWhy? ALTON complained that the cost of doing business in the country had risen by 40%.\n\nBesides, it claimed that a 2020 economic downturn and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war have financially and negatively impacted the telecommunications industry.\n\nBut, how did the Russia-Ukraine war affect the industry? ALTON claimed that the war increased their operating expenses by 35% due to higher energy costs.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the new price? The set price for calls will be raised from \u20a66.4 to \u20a68.95, while the price cap for SMS will be raised from \u20a64 to \u20a65.61.\n\nAnyway, this development occurred as business organisations continued to devise ways to survive the country\u2019s harsh economic conditions.\n\nRemember that Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO) \u2014 in order to survive the country\u2019s harsh economic conditions \u2014 reduced its operational hours from 5 p.m. to 4 p.m. in March 2022.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, May 7, 2022, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) dismissed telecom companies\u2019 request to raise call, data, and SMS tariffs by 40%.\n\nWhy? The Commission stated that there would be no cost review in the telecom sector until empirical studies are conducted to determine whether cost increases are necessary.\n\nWhatsApp has some new features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, May 6, 2022, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s CEO, announced in a Facebook post the launch of WhatsApp\u2019s Reaction feature.\n\nWhat does this mean for WhatsApp users? This means that users can respond to messages with emojis. However, this could take several days or even weeks for the feature to become available to all users.\n\nPeople will be able to respond with six different emojis: \ud83d\udc4d, \u2764, \ud83d\ude02, \ud83d\ude2f, \ud83d\ude2d and \ud83d\ude4f.\n\nAlso, on Thursday, May 5, 2022, the company announced that the maximum size of group chats would be doubled. This increases the default maximum size of group chats from 256 to 512.\n\nAlso, users can share files up to 2GB in size, a significant increase from the previous limit of 100MB.\n\nPer a WhatsApp blog post, larger groups are being \u201cslowly\u201d rolled out, while emoji reactions and increased file size limits are making their way into the app\u2019s current version.\n\nHave we seen something like this before? Yeah. You\u2019ve probably seen the Reaction feature on Slack and Telegram. And if you\u2019re not familiar with the platforms, I believe you\u2019re familiar with other Meta platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. The feature will function similarly to Instagram and Facebook Messenger.\n\nHow can you use the feature? Just like on Instagram, you can use it by long-pressing the same message and changing the emoji or by simply clicking on the same one to remove it.\n\nYou can only add one reaction per message, and you can\u2019t hide reactions or reaction counts. Also, reactions to disappearing messages will vanish when the message vanishes.\n\nFurther, recipients may see your reaction before you remove it or if removing it fails. If removing a reaction fails, you will not be notified.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that WhatsApp announced in April 2022 that it will be rolling out a slew of new features for its users, including \u2018Community\u2019 and changes to \u2018voice call.\u2019 The voice call feature of the Facebook-backed app is already available, but the Community feature is still in development.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese three Nigerian creators Soliudeen Ogunsola, Gbadebo Bello, and Ajibola Akelebe have actively created digital content that people have used globally. Soliudeen Ogunsola is a product designer who writes down his design ideas, creates design templates, and publishes them online. Gbadebo Bello, a software engineer, expresses himself as well as the entire technical approach in his articles, which thousands of people have read. Finally, Ajibola Akelebe regards himself as a creative Visual and Brand Designer who has earned his stripes in the creation of digital content. These creators all had one thing in common \u2013 they all created content that reached global audiences in their respective niches. They also shared a stronger bond \u2013 the desire to monetize their creative works without their location being a restriction.\n\nFidia started because of the bond these three creators shared, which led to a research conducted and more creators being contacted to confirm the severity of the problem and gain a better understanding. This entire journey resulted in the creation of a long-term solution, which is now known as Fidia.\n\nExisting Solutions\n\nWith the number of startups, tools and new creators churned out regularly, the creator economy\u2019s exponential growth has never been in doubt. Due to the presence of startup giants building aggressively for some creators in this space, creator monetization isn\u2019t completely alien. With \u201csome\u201d emphasised in the previous statement, it begs the question of who are the creators not catered for in the creator economy, and why are these creators not catered for.\n\nThe sidelined emerging market of the creator economy\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that this emerging market has not been intentionally isolated, and individuals building in this space have been generous enough to make their platform as accessible as possible. But the infrastructure on which these platforms are built is the major limitation. These structures unintentionally exclude a larger portion of creators in emerging markets from using these monetisation tools, and because Stripe and Paypal do not operate in most parts of Africa, platforms built on these payment infrastructure exclude creators from the region. With African creators based in Africa accounting for a sizable portion of the creator economy, the next best option is to build a platform that is more generic and does not have the limitations that other platforms do. Fortunately, several platforms have emerged, but Fidia is one that could have a long-lasting impact on creators and bring about the long-awaited revolution.\n\nFusion, Solution and Revolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIDIA\n\nRecall the bond shared by Soliudeen Ogunsola, Gbadebo Bello, and Ajibola Akelebe \u2013 the desire to monetize their creative works without their location being a restriction. There was a fusion of interest amongst the three founders which led to the design of Fidia, Soliudeen Ogunsola, the Chief Executive Officer, described Fidia as \u201ca one-stop shop for creators to make money from what they love doing\u201d.\n\n\u201cImagine a place where creators can monetize their passion\u201d Soliudeen inferred, \u201cThat\u2019s Fidia!\u201d. Gbadebo Bello, the CTO and co-founder of Fidia, stated explicitly in an article, that \u201cFidia provides creators with a suite of toolkits aimed at empowering them.\u201d and that \u201cFidia\u2019s goal is to help creators make a living from their work.\u201d\n\nThese statements bring us to the solutions provided by Fidia, which consist of unique offerings that address most of the challenges faced by creators.\n\nThe possibility of creators receiving payment and financial support from anywhere in the world, irrespective of the creator\u2019s geographic location, with the introduction of Fidia payment links.\n\nThe ability of creators to create a one-page link-in bio website that allows them to quickly create an instant portfolio of their creative work. Fidia named this feature \u201cThe creator profile\u201d which is designed to accommodate creators\u2019 diverse interests and fan bases while also allowing them to showcase all of this in the most creative way possible.\n\nAllowing creators to support one another is another way to foster relationships among creators, Fidia successfully hacked this with the transfer feature, which is solely for cash transfers between Fidia creators.\n\nSelling digital products as a means of monetization on the platform provides creators with a way to not only showcase their work but also earn money while doing so.\n\nFidia intends not only to provide tools for creators, but also to investigate other avenues of support for creators and their creative businesses. With major plans in the works to financially support creators, these offerings are only the beginning of what this organisation has in store for the future. Though the founders\u2019 hopes for the creator economy have not been realised because it is still a work in progress. We can still imagine what this revolution will look like in the coming years, with many new platforms aggressively building and Fidia taking a step further into not just building for creators to earn money but also for them to showcase their creative works and grow their creative businesses. This clearly demonstrates that no level of creator is left out, and that the platform is as inclusive as possible. It is safe to say that the creator economy\u2019s future is bright, and that the long-awaited revolution may be just around the corner.\n\nTo find out more about Fidia, send an email at support@getfidia.com or visit https://getfidia.com/You can also follow @getfidia on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more investors embrace digital assets as a way to diversify their portfolios, Mushe (XMU), Mist (MIST) and Highstreet (HIGH) are the three cryptocurrencies that investors should consider acquiring right now. Why these three digital currencies? To start, all three tokens have experienced a good time in the market within the past couple of weeks. Mushe had the most significant price jump, with its tokens increasing by more than 400% since its presale launch on April 18. When it first hit the market, the tokens were priced at $0.005 per token. However, the price continues to rise as the date of its full launch on July 4 approaches. Both MIST and HIGH have also performed well, showing increases in the first week in May before the market-wide dips across the crypto industry.\n\nWhy you should invest in small-cap cryptocurrencies\n\nThe best time to purchase any asset is when it\u2019s low. Like stocks or properties, you buy low and either sell high or hold. With the low entry cost for small-cap cryptocurrencies like XMU, MIST and HIGH, investors can expect enormous returns as the price of the tokens continue to rise. What qualifies as a small-cap cryptocurrency? Well, these are crypto that may be brand new or have not shown their market sturdiness. This is advantageous for investors. Whereas more well-known crypto, such as Bitcoin, have been around for years, the price of owning a token is too high for the average investor. Plus, holding a fraction of a large cryptocurrency usually does not result in the same returns as owning several affordable small-cap cryptocurrencies. With small-cap tokens, investors can sell as soon as the price increases beyond their target to garner a profit or hold onto their investments for the long term.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about Mushe, MIST, and HIGH is that the tokens can be used in the metaverse. MIST Metaverse is an open-world, action, role-playing game built on the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. It is a block-chain based action RPG game centred around NFTs, staking and farming. Players can use the MIST token, the in-game utility token, for multiple functions, including purchasing NFTs or farming inside and outside the gaming universe. The NFTs in MIST are not the typical \u201ccollectable card\u201d NFTs found with other crypto but are, instead, usable and functional NFTs that can be inserted into the game and become special in-game items.\n\nHighstreet is another Play-to-Earn (P2E), open-world metaverse that incorporates shopping, gaming, NFTs, traditional brands and crypto brands within the role-playing game. Users can shop within the virtual universe using Highstreet\u2019s native token HIGH. The tokens can be used for game progression, access to special events, purchase of real estate or purchase limited-edition products in the Highstreet marketplace.\n\nBut not to be outdone by these innovative cryptocurrencies, XMU has its own suite of products offered by Mushe World to entice gamers and investors. These products include Mushe Wallet, MusheSwap (DEX) and the MusheVerse. Users will be able to use XMU tokens for all Mushe products. A bonus is that Mushe tokens are compatible with other blockchains, making them beneficial to investors, crypto enthusiasts and gamers who want to use the tokens to buy, trade, or sell in the metaverse. MusheVerse will be built on the Solana network taking advantage of its speed and scalability.\n\nHow you can invest in small-cap cryptocurrency today\n\nMushe has sold more than 49,000,000 of 116,550,000 tokens available in stage 1 of the presale. A massive success for a cryptocurrency that has been available to the public for less than a month. It is expected that the tokens will continue to gain traction ahead of its July 4 full launch. Mushe is built on the Ethereum network but will be migrating over to the Solana and Stellar networks in the near future.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration: https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "When Nigeria shut its land borders in August 2019, protecting local farmers, boosting local food production and curbing arms influx that threatened the country\u2019s security were notable buzz words. More than two and half years later, the government has been unable to articulate what the country gained even though proponents believe it curbed smuggling.\n\nPetrol, at its subsidised cost in Nigeria, is the cheapest among neighbouring countries. At N167 per litre on the average in Nigeria, it sells for N419 in Benin, N406 in Niger, N360 in Chad, and N438 in Cameroon. The incentive to smuggle petrol out of Nigeria was still in place when the borders were closed: fuel subsidy.\n\nAnalysis of trade data shows, however, that Nigeria not only lost out in making money from trade within the region, but insecurity has also worsened. If curbing insecurity was an objective, available data suggest that it was not achieved. The Nigeria Security Tracker by the Council on Foreign Relations shows there were 8,075 deaths due to violence in 2019 (the year the borders were closed), but by 2020, the number of deaths increased to 9,663 and the number of deaths was 10,343 by 202.\n\nIn trade, while Nigeria\u2019s imports from the ECOWAS region declined during the border closure, it was marginal but so did exports, except at a higher margin. Nigeria\u2019s exports to the sub-region (much of which happen by land), declined from N2.24 trillion in 2019 to N841 billion in 2020 and N1.24 trillion in 2021.\n\nWhile some local farmers reported making more money during the border closure, it was a nightmare for others.\n\nA BusinessDay investigation in 2020 in some border communities of Ogun State had found that farmers had become victims of the border closure that was meant to protect them. Security agencies, notably the Customs, Police, and Army, using a document bearing the name of the Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service, had extorted hundreds of millions of naira from farmers. They told the farmers that being in close proximity to the borders meant their farm produce, cultivated on Nigerian soil, was no longer permitted \u201cinside\u201d Nigeria along with everything else suspected to have been smuggled.\n\nRead also: Border reopening \u2018ll not reduce food prices \u2013 Expert\n\nTo bring their farm produce \u201cinto Nigeria\u201d, even though they were already Nigerians producing on Nigerian soil, they had to obtain the Quarantine document that was a payment voucher at dozens of checkpoints before they arrived at major markets in Abeokuta and Lagos, more if they ventured to go \u201cdeeper into Nigeria\u201d. Yet, they were supposed to be principal beneficiaries of the border closure.\n\nIn December 2020, one month to the commencement of the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement, Nigeria reopened four out of eight major land borders: Seme, Illela, Maigatari and Mfun, under what it termed a phased reopening arrangement. Last month, the Federal Government approved the re-opening of the Idiroko, Jibiya, Kamba, and Ikom land borders, after 32 months.\n\n\u201cNigeria gained absolutely nothing from the border closure,\u201d says Emmanuel Ijewere, vice president of Nigeria Agribusiness Group. \u201cThe reason is simple; Nigerians are smart people and when they have an intention, and government obstructs it, they will find a way around it because there are people in government that will connive with them to achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, during events such as the border closure, rather than end whatever the government may have considered problems, actors are simply swapped. This time, \u201crelations of those who are supposed to be gatekeepers take over from genuine business people or become commissioned agents,\u201d says Ijewere.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Security Studies, trade officials it interviewed said the closure had probably resulted in new smuggling routes as illicit dealers are determined to move their goods across borders. They said products \u2013 including rice \u2013 were likely to have been smuggled in smaller consignments, given the difficulty of driving heavy-duty trucks through alternate routes. Already, informal trading via unapproved routes is a long-standing economic practice in local communities.\n\nFor Tunji Falade, a former chairman of the agriculture and agro-Allied sector, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, \u201cNigeria made some gains, the clampdown on smugglers, especially in the area of food, drugs, and firearms reduced influx of these items, which could be termed a gain\u201d.\n\nHe, however, says: \u201cNo country can successfully close its borders permanently because no country is an island. The most important thing is to address the real problems that led to the closure which is the porosity of our borders.\u201d\n\nFor him, the more permanent solution is addressing the factors that led to the government thinking a border closure was required in the first place.",

          "title": "Banks move to acquire discos over N860bn debt",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nSome banks that provided funds to the 11 electricity distribution companies for the acquisition of majority shares in government\u2019s power utilities during the 2013 privatisation exercise are currently moving to take over the ailing firms over their inability to service their loans, Business Hallmark has learnt.\n\nThe owners of the 11 discos, according to the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), had paid the Federal Government $1.26billion (N188.1bn then) to acquire 60 percent controlling shares in the firms, while the six generation companies coughed out $1.27billion for the power plants, which brought the total privatisation proceeds for the discos and gencos to $2.53billion.\n\nWhile the value of the 11 discos paid back in 2013 was N171billion, the value of both transactions (discos and gencos) at the time was about N404billion based on the exchange rate of N196 to U.S dollar then.\n\nHowever, owing to the discos\u2019 inability to service the facilities, the loans, together with the interest have ballooned to around N860billion, more than 400% the actual money received from banks.\n\nAlready, two of the eleven discos, Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IEDC) and the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) have been acquired by their lenders.\n\nAfter several failed debt restructuring deals, the United Bank for Africa (UBA), forcefully took over the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company Plc. in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe public should note that arising from KANN\u2019s inability to service its loan and the ensuing dispute over the servicing of the loan from UBA PLC, the lender exercised its rights by appointing a Receiver/Manager over KANN.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, including NERC, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the BPE had on several times worked to broker an amicable resolution between the contending parties,\u201d the Ministry of Power, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) had said in a joint statement they issued on the development.\n\nA source in UBA told our correspondent that the core investors in AEDC, KANN Consortium, took a loan of $122m (about N20billion then) from the bank to acquire 60% equity in the disco.\n\n\u201cAs at December 2021, the outstanding loan, plus interest, has risen to over N100billion, using the prevalent exchange rate, the source disclosed.\n\nHe also claimed that as a result of its dire financial situation, the AEDC had struggled to meet not only its debt obligations to its lenders, but also welfare obligations to its staff, which resulted in a strike action by members of the Nigerian Union of Electricity Employees in December 2021. The industrial action resulted in a total blackout in AEDC\u2019s network area of the FCT, Nasarawa, Kogi, parts of Edo, Niger and Kaduna States.\n\nAnother source in the BPE who did not want his identity revealed, told BH that UBA was forced to move in when its management realised that the power firm is \u201cterminally ill\u201d and will no longer be able to effectively service the loans it obtained from it.\n\n\u201cThe bank had no option than to take over the disco, or it would have gone down with its funds\u201d, the source further explained.\n\nCorroborating the BPE\u2019s source, the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, said the takeover of the Abuja disco by UBA had to happen.\n\n\u201cThe AEDC has, of recent, been facing significant operational challenges arising from a dispute between the core investors as owners of 60 per cent equity in the AEDC and the UBA as lenders for the acquisition for the majority shareholding in the public utility.\n\n\u201cThe situation has currently deteriorated due to lack of access to intervention finances leading to a point whereby legitimate entitlements of the staff are being owed thus leading to service disruptions on December 6, 2021 within its franchise area\u201d, the minister explained.\n\nBH reliably gathered that the new AEDC management under the UBA receivership declared N11 billion collection for December 2021 operations.\n\n\u201cIf it were the old regime, maybe there would be under-declaration and a bogus recurrent expenditure that will be used to draw it down\u201d, declared Kola Olubiyo, President of Nigeria Consumer Protection Network.\n\nThe AEDC sudden turnaround, sources informed BH, has encouraged other banks to go the way of UBA. In February 2022, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria also announced the takeover of the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company after repeated debt repayment defaults and renegotiation dispute with its lender, Polaris Bank.\n\nThe development came barely five months after the corporation secured a judgement from a Federal High Court on September 8, 2021, which granted orders in favour of AMCON as Receiver/Manager of Integrated Energy Distribution and Marketing Limited, IBEDC\u2019s core investor, over default in Loan Service Agreement.\n\nWhile the owners of the two distressed discos are still smarting from the loss of their prized assets, the fate of the other 9 discos, namely Benin, Eko, Enugu, Ikeja, Jos, Kaduna, Kano, Port Harcourt and Yola presently hangs in the balance.\n\nSources in some of the affected banks told BH that reports reaching them on the financial health of the discos are alarming.\n\n\u201cBarring a miracle, the discos, as presently constituted, are not in a position to repay the loans released to them.\n\n\u201cThough the discos had been presenting a different picture, but reports released by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company Plc (NBET), a Federal Government agency that purchases electricity in bulk from gencos through power purchase agreements, and sells it through vesting contracts to distribution companies and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) on their performances are quite damning.\n\n\u201cI think you should get the reports and study it to understand the picture I am trying to paint,\u201d a top staff in one of the nation\u2019s first-tier banks advised\n\nAccording to the most recent electricity industry data (January to September 2021) compiled by NERC obtained by BH, the shortfall in remittances by discos to NBET and the Market Operator of the sector rose to N326 billion.\n\nThe 11 distribution companies, the report stated, failed to remit N287.8bn to NBET during the period.\n\nThe report also stated that the discos could not remit N38.31billion to the Market Operator, an arm of the Transmission Company of Nigeria ((TCN), bringing their cumulative indebtedness to the sector to precisely N325.9 billion during the nine month period.\n\nThe report further stated that an invoice of N612.26billion was issued by NBET to the 11 discos as their bill for the nine months period, but the power firms remitted N324.46billion, leaving a shortfall of N287.8billion.\n\nThe NERC document stated that while the market operator issued a total invoice of N159.79billion to the 11 discos during the period under review, the discos remitted only N121.48billion, leaving a balance of N38.31billion.\n\nIn the distribution category, IBEDC, which had been taken over by AMCON, owed the market N40.76 billion after remitting N40.02 billion (49.5 percent) of the N80.78 billion invoice it received from NBET.\n\nLikewise, Kaduna Electric owed the market N35.76 billion after remitting N11.84 billion (24.8 percent) of N47.61 billion of NBET\u2019s invoice.\n\nBenin DisCo owes the market N28.75 billion after remitting N25.91 billion (47.4 percent) of the N54.65 billion invoice, while AEDC remitted N48.48 billion (63.89 percent) of the N75.87 billion invoice leaving a debt of N27.4 billion.\n\nEkoDisCo and Ikeja Electric seem to be the only discos that fared better out of the lot. The duo remitted N44.32 billion (63.5 percent) and N66.29 billion (72.1 percent) of the N69.72 billion and N92 billion invoices from NBET leaving debts of N25.4 billion and N25.71 billion respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Enugu DisCo is owing a debt of N23.98 billion after paying N32.35 billion (57.4 percent ) of N56.33 billion invoice, while Port Harcourt DisCo ended up with N21.46 billion debt after remitting N19.61 billion (47.7 percent) of N41.07 billion.\n\nJos DisCo has a shortfall of N21.26 billion in the nine-month period, remitting only N9.62 billion (31.2 percent) of N30.88 billion invoice, while Kano DisCo paid in N24.01 billion (55.3 percent) of its N43.4 billion invoice.\n\nThe laggard is Yola DisCo which remitted only N2.01 billion (10.1 percent ) of the total N19.95 billion invoice received from NBET.\n\n\u201cGenCos and other market operators often complain that discos usually fail to remit the complete value of energy allocated to them by both NBET and MO.\n\n\u201cWhat this implies is that the discos are not making enough profit to pay for electricity supplied, not to talk of paying their debts to banks.\n\n\u201cIs it not when you make profit that you pay back loans and other financial commitments?\u201d, a ministry of power staff told our correspondent.\n\nAlso, a top executive in one of the discos who spoke with our correspondent on the development, amongst other reasons, faulted the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s decision to escrow the bank accounts of the 11 discos, an action he said significantly reduced their buoyancy and ability to pay their lenders.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government had in 2021 through the CBN locked the power distributors accounts in an effort to aid the monitoring of funds and ensure the repayment of debts owed the it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the policy accorded high priority to invoices from market operators like NBET and the MO, leaving practically nothing for us to repay bank loans\u201d, the top executive moaned.\n\nMeanwhile, the immediate past chairman of NERC, Dr. Sam Amadi, has warned against the take over of management of electricity distribution companies by AMCON, maintaining that service delivery to consumers will not improve under the arrangement.\n\nAccording to the former NERC boss, the primary motive of banks is to recover their loans to the discos.\n\n\u201cAt this level it is very difficult to see anywhere much improvement will come from. AMCON is not electricity supplying agency.\n\n\u201cYes, they may keep the same management but their bottom line is to recover their money.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t see much improvement for electricity consumers except AMCON hands over to a much more technically capable operators and may be able to invite its share investors who have the experience to finance and the competence to do change management effectively.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that some of the discos are finding it difficult to repay their loans, Amadi warned that the discos are going bankrupt.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the DisCos are financially distressed. They were going through hard financial times. They were over leveraged so they are struggling to service their debts.\n\n\u201cAnd compounded by failure in the value chain in terms of payment of revenue arising from customers paying, in terms of public offices owing commitment.\n\n\u201cSo, the other inefficiencies in the value chain compound their crisis. They don\u2019t have deep financial capabilities to finance short term and recover long term.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, they don\u2019t have the financial capabilities to engineer quick turnover around of their operations. So, they are in almost like bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe banks are taking over and may likely do so because the banks are through AMCON trying to recover their money by taking over the assets so they can manage them better or to guarantee themselves their asset is secure from the money they lent to those companies,\u201d Amadi noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the Head of Investment Research at Sigma Pensions, Wale Okunrinboye, said most of the companies were thinly capitalised entities that used leverage to fund the discos.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, the firms (discos) were no more than financial SPVs put together to win the bid in the hope of selling on to strategic players in the medium term.\n\n\u201cThe financing arrangements they adopted modeled fairly stable exchange rates on the USD debt, cost-reflective electricity tariffs, and relatively conservative collection losses.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, subsequent events exposed the folly of these assumptions as naira devaluation, greater than expected collection losses and delays in adjusting tariffs resulted in many of the discos been saddled with large losses.\n\n\u201cInterestingly despite the prospect of bankruptcy from missed bank loan payments, many chose to hold on rather than selling equity to stronger players.\n\n\u201cThese larger and more capitalised entities could have assumed these obligations staving bankruptcies,\u201d he maintained.",

          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nCompanies in Nigeria are having nightmares over cyber attacks, which is increasing their cost operations. Deposit money banks, for instance, are spending huge sums on cyber security programmes to wade off such unwelcomed visitors.\n\nAccording to reports, the country has lost over millions of dollar (N60 billion) to the pernicious activities of hackers in recent years. A bank\u2019s IT manager, who craved anonymity, lamented that leaving office after the day\u2019s work is usually with trepidation, as anything can happen over night.\n\n\u201cWhenever we are leaving office it is with great anxiety, because you resume the next day only to see your systems compromised and vital materials either corrupted and stolen. We are in a constant battle with them, and it seems they are winning, and this is costing banks hugely\u201d, he said.\n\nBut the harm is not only limited to financial loss alone, there is whole question of compromising national security when hackers get hold of and break into sensitive data base as was the case recently when cyber criminals broke into NIMC server.\n\nAccording to reports, over three million National Identity Numbers of Nigerians were stolen after a hacker known only as Sam broke into the server of the National Identity Management Company.\n\nRevealing how easy it was for him to breach the NIMC server and access personal information of millions of Nigerians in an article he shared on infosecwriteups.com, the hacker boasted that he got access to \u201cjuice\u201d on the Nigerian Government agency\u2019s server and that he could go ahead to do whatever he desired with other sensitive data at his disposal.\n\nDisplaying a defaced National Identity card of a Nigerian alongside the article, the hacker said, \u201cI\u2019ve got one more output for s3 bucket, I casually tried to access it without any hope, and damn! The s3 bucket is full of juice.\n\n\u201cI just simply got access to their (Nigeria) data of internal files, users and everything they have. I can download everything, even the whole bucket. I am sure that the bucket is full of juice.\n\n\u201cI wanted to look at more files but as we have to follow bug bounty rules I stopped doing more. I\u2019ve got one more s3 bucket with nuclei and it also contained about 4\u20135 gigs of data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve rewarded 5250$ for only one report and 0$ for the second one even it contained so much sensitive data,\u201d the hacker wrote in the article that has continued to generate reactions from some Nigerians on Twitter especially tech enthusiasts.\n\nA user on the micro-blogging platform with the handle @isidags while reacting to the development said, \u201cI\u2019m shocked Nigerians are shocked.\n\n\u201cSeems you people don\u2019t know the government and country you\u2019re involved with.\u201d\n\nAnother user known as @boluxxxx while commenting said, \u201cJokes aside, this is enough reason for Buhari to sack Pantami.\u201d\n\nBerating Nigeria\u2019s weak cyber security, another Twitter user, @bespokeKENErd, said, \u201cIt was only a matter of time before this happened. Nigeria\u2019s information security is ridiculously lax. So careless with sensitive data.\u201d\n\nThe hacking of the NIMC server has not only exposed Nigeria\u2019s weak cyber security but also highlighted the danger the country\u2019s residents and investments were currently under.\n\nThe latest cyber attack comes less than two months after the Nigerian Communications Commission in November 2021 issued a warning that an Iranian hacking group was planning to carry out cyber espionage across Africa.\n\nA statement from the agency had further disclosed that the hackers were targeting telecoms, Internet Service Providers, and Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Nigeria and other African countries.\n\nThe incident also came months after the President Muhammadu Buhari administration while mandating Nigerians to enroll for National Identification Number claimed that it was going to stop crimes in the country including those perpetrated via the Internet.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration in May 2021, President Buhari said, \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians.\n\nWe will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u201d\n\nAssuring Nigerians of how vital the new system would be to crime fighting in the country, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, in June 2021, claimed that incidents of terror such as banditry and kidnapping in the country had significantly reduced as a result of the insistence by government for persons in Nigeria to register for NIN.\n\nPantami went further to say that the improved database will protect Nigerians more than ever before. But despite those assurances, the latest attack has exposed the failure of the President Buhari administration to protect Nigerians from cyber criminals.\n\nAbout two weeks ago suspected Russian hackers started targeting Nigerian websites, with Bet9ja falling as their first victim. This comes after the United States said it had secretly removed malware from computer networks around the world in recent weeks, in its bid to pre-empt Russian cyber attacks.\n\nThe U.S said the move was necessary because of Russia\u2019s plan to attack American critical infrastructure. It said the malware it removed enabled Russians to create \u2018botnets\u2019 \u2014 networks of private computers that are infected with malicious software and controlled by the G.R.U., the intelligence arm of the Russian military.\n\nBet9ja first announced that it was having issues with its website on last Wednesday on its verified Twitter handle. According to the company, its customers were not able to login into their accounts.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe are currently experiencing an issue with our website. This means you may not be able to log in.\n\n\u201cWe take this matter very seriously and our IT team is working on it as their number one priority right now.\u201d\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the firm announced that it had become a victim of a cyber-attack. Bet9ja said, \u201cThe Bet9ja betting platform, just like so many market-leading global organisations, has recently become a victim of a sophisticated criminal cyber-attack, which is restricting our customers from having access to the platform.\n\n\u201cWe are working tirelessly with our IT team, independent forensics, and cybercrime experts to resolve this, we take this matter extremely seriously. Our priority is protecting our customers and you have our assurances that your accounts will not be compromised, and all your funds are safe.\n\n\u201cWe apologise for this situation and once back online, we will reward our loyal customers with a truly sensational bonanza of promotions.\u201d\n\nIn a previous post, the firm added that its customer\u2019s funds are secured.\n\nAccording to the Founder, e86 Limited, OluGbengaOdeyemi, Bet9ja\u2019s attack is likely to become commonplace with other companies if proactive steps are not taken.\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, we are likely to see more of that. The U.S government sent out a notice/warning about a week or two ago about impending attacks from Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cEvery organisation must beef up their security at this time. If there are things they have been cutting back on, now is the time to fix those things. For organisations that have always kept their infrastructure up to date, this will be a good time to have regular internal checks and thorough penetration testing done on their infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that organisations won\u2019t find out about attacks on their infrastructure when it\u2019s too late to salvage anything.\u201d\n\nExperts say cybercriminals have increased their attacks on Nigerian businesses, especially since 2021, exploiting business owners with ransomware, as 5,600 small and medium enterprises in 31 countries fell victim.\n\nAccording to Global cybersecurity firm, Sophos, in its \u2018State of Ransomware 2022\u2019 report, cybercriminals attacked 71 percent of businesses last year through ransomware.\n\nRansomware is an extension of malware, used to paralyse the system of an organisation by cybercriminals who take possession of an organisation\u2019s database, and place encryption key, to deny the company access.\n\nIn order for organisations to have access to the stolen files, they have to pay for the encryption key. And according to Sophos, 40 percent of companies in Nigeria caught in the web paid in exchange for the key despite having backup data.\n\nIt was gathered that the organisations prefer to recover the stolen database due to the cost and time needed to deploy the backup data. Sophos also stated that some business\u2019s backup data might not be up to date.\n\nBusinessHallmark learnt that organisations in the country suffer more cyberattacks than any other country in Africa. But these attacks go unreported despite a mandatory regulation for disclosure.\n\nCyber attacks in Nigeria are rarely disclosed, giving an ambience of safety. But in reality, Nigeria firms suffers some of the worst cyber attacks on the African continent.\n\nAccording to a report by Sophos, a UK-based cybersecurity company, 86% of Nigerian organisations surveyed said they suffered cyber attacks in the last 12 months; the second-highest after India.\n\nImportantly, the country ranked in the top five for major attacks including malware attacks, ransomware, stolen account credentials and crypto-jacking. 64% of cyber attacks in Nigeria exploited misconfigurations on the organisation\u2019s server.\n\n\u201cNigerian organisations suffered the most data leaks than any country surveyed in the report. 57% of Nigerian organisations said their public cloud data was exposed in the last year. Meanwhile, 46% of Nigerian organisations said their account credentials, the method hackers used to attack Twitter, were stolen in the last 12 months.\u201d\n\nWhile Sophos captured these types of attacks, other attacks such as brute force, email compromises, WhatsApp account hijacking among many others are also real threats.\n\nOn the one hand, Nigeria is not a high-value target for cyber attacks, at least not on the scale seen abroad. The relatively low value of the Nigerian currency has also forced more local threat actors to double down on international scams such as dating scams and business email compromise schemes.\n\nIn the last half of 2019, international anti-fraud efforts led to the arrest of over 100 Nigerian scammers and the disruption of over $100 million in fraudulent transactions.\n\nYet in Nigeria, the culture of secrecy is strong and makes it difficult to know domestic breaches happen. Organisations are less willing to disclose when and if these attacks happen.\n\nIn August 2019, Business Day reported that the Nigerian Yellow Card website was leaking data. The website housed sensitive health information for Nigerian air travellers who have been vaccinated against yellow fever. The government did not respond to the report.\n\nIn another incident in 2018, customer data for Arik Air, a Nigerian travel company, was found unsecured on an Amazon S3 bucket on the cloud. The unsecured link held three months of customer data and was discovered on September 6.\n\nBut it took 18 days for the company to acknowledge the leak after it was exposed. The data was secured after September 24 but Arik did not issue any statement regarding this development.\n\nSpeaking to BusinessHallmark a cybersecurity expert Abayomi Enitan explains that Nigerian organisations have sociological issues revolving around trust and cultural problems when it comes to disclosing cyber attacks.\n\nHe said \u201cwe Nigerians have trust issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are security researchers who would find critical vulnerabilities or get access to company data and want to responsibly disclose it, but some organisations have not fully gotten the importance of crowd sourcing reporting.\u201d\n\nAccording to him when researchers discover such leaks, rather than address the exploits, some companies choose to intimidate the source and accuse them of malicious intent.\n\n\u201cI have seen cases where people have been arrested or had lawsuits against them for things [vulnerabilities] they\u2019ve found on companies,\u201d he disclosed .\n\nYet, disclosing attacks is good practice, he said, but many companies choose not to do so.\n\n\u201c[Some companies] may not want to go on-the-record about it because it could affect their investments, affect how customers perceive them, how people perceive the company going forward,\u201d Enitan said.\n\nHe added that in some other cases if the breach was not high impact or critical, companies may not want to talk about it.\n\nThe Nigerian Cybercrime Act was signed into law in May 2015. This is the country\u2019s first legislature that covers cybersecurity in the country. Its enforcement is the shared responsibility of the Attorney-General of the Federation and the National Security Adviser.\n\nThe Act created a National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to manage cyberattacks. Section 21 of the Act mandates individuals and organisations to report cyberattacks when they happen:\n\nAny Person or institution, who operates a computer system or a network, whether public or private, must immediately inform the National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center Of any attacks, intrusions and other disruptions liable to hinder the functioning of another computer system or network so that the National CERT Can take the necessary measures to tackle the issues.\n\nBut enforcement has been a problem, according to experts.",
          "summary": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMUCompanies in Nigeria are having nightmares over cyber attacks, which is increasing their cost operations.\nDeposit money banks, for instance, are spending huge sums on cyber security programmes to wade off such unwelcomed visitors.\n\u201cI just simply got access to their (Nigeria) data of internal files, users and everything they have.\n57% of Nigerian organisations said their public cloud data was exposed in the last year.\nIts enforcement is the shared responsibility of the Attorney-General of the Federation and the National Security Adviser.",

          "text": "From a seemingly difficult year in 2020, no thanks to Covid-19, the Breweries industry has once again exhibited strength and sustainability. This is clearly reflected in their First quarter results in which the major brewers, the Nigerian Breweries and Guinness Nigeria showcased impressive numbers in all measurement indicators.\n\nFor instance, while the Nigerian Breweries posted a profit growth of 77 per cent in Q1, 2022, Guinness Nigeria grew its profit by 731per cent in Q3, over the figure of last year. Details show that NB PLC recorded a profit of N13.61 billion, representing a 77.71 per cent increase over the N7.6billion it achieved in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have hinged the impressive performance of the giant brewer to higher sales and increase in the price of beer and other factors which include interest made from its deposit in banks.\n\nAccordingly also, Nigerian Breweries (NB) Plc posted a N137.8 billion first quarter 2022 revenue, representing a 30.4 percent growth from N105.7 billion in 2021.\n\nNB Plc also recorded 80.7 percent growth in its profit before tax to N20.76 billion from N11.51 billion it achieved in the corresponding period of 2021. This, analysts say was driven by a 189 percent increase in financing income, as well as 85.6 percent and 51 percent moderations in the company\u2019s income tax and finance charges.\n\nThe financial results showed that the company\u2019s long-term borrowing dropped to N3.54 billion from N6.831billion in the corresponding period of 2021.\n\nNB plc\u2019s total assets are now at N521 billion, while net assets grew 8.18% to N185.98 billion.\n\nNigerian Breweries Plc had declared a dividend of N1.20 kobo for FY 2021, which was paid on April 22, 2022, while Earnings per share for the Q1 2022 period is N1.69, a 74% growth from N0.96 in Q1 2021.\n\nThe company last traded at N58.85 per share and has appreciated by 17.70% from year to date.\n\nIt operates over 10 breweries and approximately two malting plants in Aba and Kaduna. It also focuses on ancillary business, which includes manufacturing cans, labels, cartons and bottles. It also has an export business.\n\nGuinness Nigeria\n\nGUINNESS Nigeria, a subsidiary of Diageo Plc, and the leading total beverage alcohol company in Nigeria posted a revenue of N159,444,503 for its third quarter period ended 31 March 2022, which represents a 39 per cent growth over the same period last year.\n\nThe Company reported a Profit After Tax of N15,278, 335,000 in the period under review which represents a 731 per cent growth over same period last year.\n\nThe results show impressive performance and significant improvement when compared to the same period last year, a testament to an unwavering commitment to meeting consumer demands as well as the company\u2019s resilience in a challenging operating environment.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Mr. Baker Magunda, Managing Director/CEO, Guinness Nigeria Plc said: \u201cIn the first nine months of fiscal 22, Guinness Nigeria continued to grow on the back of the strong recovery in the first half of fiscal 22. The business has delivered growth in the face of the challenging operating environment characterized by rising inflation and forex challenges in the 3 months ended 31 March 2022. Revenue grew by 39 per cent to N159.4 billion benefitting mainly from price increases across all brands, as well as from favorable brand mix and resilient consumer demand.\u201d\n\nThe released statement revealed that Gross Profit grew 76 per cent in the period as revenues grew ahead of cost of sales. Cost of Sales increased by 24 per cent, largely due to inflationary pressure, sales volume growth, forex devaluation impacting imported materials, air freight cost increase and a shift towards more expensive can products. The Company also said that its Marketing expenses increased 68 per cent versus last year as it increased its marketing investments.\n\n\u201cWe increased marketing investment to support our strategic growth priorities and the recovery of the on-trade. Distribution expenses also increased 36 per cent driven by higher volumes, freight and diesel inflation and extended journey time for road transportation. All of our efforts delivered an operating profit growth of 200 per cent to N22.9 billion.\u201d Magunda explained.\n\n\u2018\u2018We like that GUINNESS maintained resilient topline growth, reflecting positive results from a favourable product mix, increased investments in its brands, and operational efficiencies. We believe the margin expansions despite cost pressures reflect the brewer\u2019s operational efficiencies and productivity gains. Thus, we expect the company to sustain its growth momentum in Q4-22 on the back of resilient consumer demand and improved trade outlet coverage as the brewer continues to optimize its route to consumer strategies. Overall, we believe the company remains well-positioned to maintain impressive earnings over 2022FY. Our estimates are under review.\u201d Said Cordros analysts\n\nIndeed, the Breweries industry has in fact latched on the size and demographic (in beer consuming age) of Nigeria\u2019s population which remains a major attraction for brewing business to grow their top and bottom lines in recent times. But there are fears that the shrinking income of the population may pose challenges of growth to the brewing industries.\n\nThese companies achieved this in an environment of high inflation, insecurity, high unemployment and underemployment and weak economy.\n\nHowever, experts believe that, \u201cBeer is the world\u2019s oldest alcoholic beverage. Early origins can be dated back to 6 million BC in written history of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. It was largely considered a home activity until the 14th century when the world\u2019s oldest operating commercial brewery was established in Bavaria. This was the catalyst that broke the mold from family oriented practice, to an entrepreneur\u2019s dream. In the US, most of the major players in the market were established in the mid to late 1800\u2019s. With an industry that has been around as long as the beer brewing industry has, it is no secret that it has reached a pinnacle. At the same time it is showing no signs of decline, therefore maturity is the proper life cycle stage for this industry\u201d.",

          "text": "The trial of the detained governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State and member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Farah Dagogo, before a Chief Magistrate Court in Port Harcourt, has been adjourned till May 23, 2022\n\nThe development followed the inability of the Nigeria Police, which is holding the lawmaker in custody since April 29, 2022, failed to produce him in court.\n\nAddressing journalists outside the courtroom, the state prosecutor, Chidi Eke, said he has filed fresh charges against the governorship hopeful, at the Rivers State High Court.\n\nMeanwhile, the detained PDP governorship aspirant, Hon. Dagogo, has accused Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, of plotting to nail him with falsehood.\n\nDagogo, in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt by his media aide, Ibrahim Lawal, alleged that the charges against him, which he described as trumped-up, were allegedly well calculated and masterminded by the governor and his co-conspirators, to put him away and scuttle his governorship ambition.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cGovernor Nyesom Wike, during a Thanksgiving Service in Church, confirmed our concerns and fears that the trump-up charges levelled against Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo by the governor is a well calculated attempt, masterminded by the Governor and his co-conspirators to put Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo away, and out of circulation and scuttle his governorship aspiration.\n\n\u201cAt the Thanksgiving Service, the governor admitted in public, what was being rumoured in private, that he wield lots of influence in the judiciary and as such would frustrate and prevent any bail application for Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo. We want to believe that the Judiciary remains the very hope for a fair adjudication and the coming days will tell us more.\n\n\u201cHe equally justified his illegal declaration of Hon. Dagogo as a cultist and a criminal\u2019 in conformity with his attempt to tarnish the image of the Federal Lawmaker.\n\n\u201cContrary to the misinformation the Governor peddled in the House of God, Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo is not a criminal, he has never been charged as one, neither has he been convicted of such an offense. His record remains unblemished.\n\n\u201cThe story of the Niger Delta agitation and struggle is in the public domain, and Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo had stated his role publicly, the sacrifices and the overtures he rejected.\u201d",

It was on the basis of this claim that she was elected into the Senate.\n\nThe stakeholders said these documents and credentials having now been subjected to verification were found to be doubtful or non-existence.\n\nIn 2014, Oduah deposed to an affidavit and obtained a police extract (both documents were attached to the petition) where she stated that she obtained a First School Leaving Certificate from St John Odoakpu, Onitsha.\n\n\u201cHowever, upon an enquiry to the Ministry of Basic Education, Anambra State in 2019, it was discovered from their response that Senator Oduah was never among the pupils that sat for FSLC in 1973 in the Old East Central State of which the present Anambra State was part of. Thus, her claims of obtaining FSLC in 1973 are false and misleading\u201d, the stakeholders said. They attached a Certified True Copy of list of pupils who sat for the exams in 1973.\n\nIn the same affidavit and police extract submitted to INEC by Oduah, she also claimed to have participated in the National Youth Service Scheme in 1983 and that she lost the discharge certificate issued to her by the NYSC.\n\nHowever, instead of applying to the NYSC headquarters for a letter of confirmation indicating her NYSC number and the year she did the service, she submitted a letter from Nigeria Employers Consultative Association purportedly confirming that she participated in NYSC.\n\nThe PDP stakeholders in Anambra North said this claim is doubtful saying NECA is not in a position to confirm whether Oduah did NYSC or not.\n\nThe stakeholders are demanding that the PDP screening panel subject Oduah to strict documentary proof of all her claims on primary school attendance, certificate and the NYSC.\n\nThey also drew the attention of the screening panel to an item of the PDP Primaries Screening Exercise Brief Forms which harps on integrity where aspirants were expected to answer questions like \u2018Were you ever indicted by an administrative or judicial panel of enquiry?\u2019\n\nThey reminded the party that a candidate of any political party who claims documents that are misleading or unverifiable jeopardizes the seat of that party in the event of inter party litigation.\n\nThe Electoral Act 2022 in section 29(8) also imposes a fine of N10 million on the party that sponsored an unqualified candidate.",

          "text": "Russia has marked the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, triggering jitters in neighbours Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin presided over a display of Russia\u2019s vast firepower in Moscow, more than 10 weeks into an invasion of its neighbour it terms a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\n\nHe told troops they were fighting for Russia\u2019s security now.\n\nRussia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine was needed because the West was \u201cpreparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea\u201d, Putin said, referring to the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nHe gave no evidence for his assertion.\n\nRT.com reported that up to 11,000 troops marched on Moscow\u2019s iconic Red Square on Monday.\n\nThe conflict is largely called the Great Patriotic War in Russia, and May 9 is one of the country\u2019s most revered holidays.\n\nThe marching columns represented all branches of Russia\u2019s Armed Forces, including airborne troops, military police, national guardsmen and cadets.\n\nMore than 130 armoured vehicles were led by the iconic T-34-85 tank, which was one of the main \u2018workhorses\u2019 of the Red Army during the war.\n\nThe state-of-the-art T-90M Proryv (Breakthrough) main battle tanks, S-400 air-defense missile systems, and Yars thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles, were among other top-notch weapons showcased on the Red Square.\n\nIn Ukraine, Russia\u2019s celebration triggered further trepidations on what to expect from the aggressor.\n\nThe governor of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Gaidai, said: \u201cToday we do not know what to expect from the enemy, what terrible thing they might do, so please go out onto the street as little as possible, stay in the shelters.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier confirmed the deaths of dozens of people in the Russian bombing of a school in Bilohorivka, eastern Ukraine on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAs a result of a Russian strike on Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed, civilians, who simply hid at the school, sheltering from shelling,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.\n\nAbout 90 people had taken refuge at the school, Gaidai had said. There was no response from Moscow.\n\nIn the southern port of Mariupol, which has endured the most destruction of the 10-week war, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment holed up in the Azovstal steel plant pleaded with the international community to help evacuate wounded soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fight as long as we are alive to repel the Russian occupiers,\u201d Captain Sviatoslav Palamar told an online news conference.\n\nZelenskiy said his country would win against Russia and would not cede any territory.\n\n\u201cThere is no invader who can rule over our free people. Sooner or later we will win,\u201d he said in a written address to mark the World War Two victory anniversary.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrial nations vowed on Sunday to deepen Russia\u2019s economic isolation and \u201celevate\u201d a campaign against Kremlin-linked elites. read more\n\nThe G7 said it was committed to phasing out or banning Russian oil and denounced Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHis actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people,\u201d the group said, referring to Soviet Russia\u2019s role in defeating Nazi Germany 77 years ago.\n\nPutin has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine \u2013 which he casts as a battle against dangerous \u201cNazi\u201d-inspired nationalists in Ukraine \u2013 to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler invaded in 1941.\n\nUkraine and its allies reject the accusation of Nazism and the assertion that Russia is fighting for survival against an aggressive West, saying Putin unleashed an unprovoked war in an attempt to rebuild the Soviet Union.\n\nAhead of the military parade, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Yuri Borisov said the country was developing new-generation hypersonic missiles and had enough high-precision missiles and ammunition to fulfil all the tasks assigned to its armed forces.\n\nMoscow has come under increasingly punishing sanctions since its invasion on Feb. 24, with trade heavily impacted and assets seized.\n\nAt the parade on Monday, Putin addressed the reasons for the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev.\n\nRussia had to act because a large-scale offensive against the breakaway republics in the eastern Donbass region was being planned, he said.\n\n\u201cWe saw the military infrastructure unfolding [in Ukraine]; hundreds of foreign advisers starting their work; there were regular deliveries of the most modern weapons from NATO countries. The danger grew every day,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cRussia gave a preemptive rebuff to aggression \u2013 this was a forced, timely and the only right decision by a sovereign, strong and independent country,\u201d he added, referring to the launch of the military operation.\n\n\u201cDespite all the disagreements in international relations, Russia has always advocated the creation of a system of equal and indivisible security,\u201d the Russian leader said.\n\nHe reminded of Moscow\u2019s attempts to engage in dialogue on security guarantees with Washington late last year, which turned out fruitless.\n\n\u201cNATO countries didn\u2019t want to hear us, which means that, in fact, they harboured completely different plans, and we saw it,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were open preparations for a punitive operation in the Donbass and \u201can invasion of our historical lands, including Crimea,\u201d Putin insisted, adding that Kiev also announced plans to restore its nuclear capabilities.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US has been increasingly talking about \u2018American exceptionalism,\u2019 Putin pointed out.\n\nBy spreading those ideas, Washington is \u201chumiliating not only the whole world, but also its satellites, which have to pretend that they don\u2019t notice anything and humbly accept it all. But we are a different country,\u201d he insisted.",

          "text": "The planned suspension of flight operations by scheduled airline operators in the country due to commence Monday has been halted, with some airlines backing out of the arrangement.\n\nThe Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), the umbrella body of airline owners, had Friday announced the joint decision to halt all operations.\n\nThe operators had shocked Nigerians as they announced the decision to halt all operations across airports in the country due to the skyrocketing price of aviation fuel, JetA1 and sundry operating costs.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cOvertime, aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently. No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period. While aviation fuel worldwide is said to cost about 40% of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally, the present hike has shut up Nigeria\u2019s operating cost to about 95%.\n\n\u201cIn the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000. The latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\n\u201cTo this end therefore, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wishes to regrettably inform the general public that member airlines will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice,\u201d the AON had declared.\n\nIbom, others back out\n\nHowever, the declaration by 9 members of the airline body appears not to be sanctioned by the very Chief Executive Officers of airlines who signed the suspension document.\n\nAmidst the confusion, the federal government appealed to the airlines to shelve the action and allow for dialogue and intervention to address the vexed issues.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Public Affairs, Dr. James Odaudu, said efforts to assuage the situation were ongoing and appealed to the airline operators to consider the multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking their business-informed decisions and actions.\n\nOn Saturday, Ibom Air led the withdrawal list of airlines as it announced its decision to continue its operations on its route unhindered, stating it has financial obligations to suppliers, financiers and staff, which depend on uninterrupted flow of revenue to service.\n\n\u201cMore importantly is the fact that having been paid by customers in advance for flight bookings we are bound by contract to deliver the services already paid for, to avoid exposing the airline to the risk of avoidable litigation,\u201d the airline declared.\n\nOther airlines that later towed similar line include Dana Air, Green Africa Airways, Overland Airways and Arik Air, while the trio of Air Peace, Azman Air and Max Air in separate statements Sunday remained resolute with the AON declaration.\n\nAON surrenders\n\nThe operators later caved in to pressure Sunday evening and in another statement announced the suspension of the action.\n\n\u201cThe Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) wishes to inform the general public that further to numerous calls from the highest echelons in government with promises to urgently intervene in the crisis being faced by airlines due to the astronomic and continuously rising cost of JetA1, that the AON has acceded to requests to withdraw the action for the time being while we allow for a fresh round of dialogue with government in the hope of reaching an amicable solution.\n\n\u201d We have also reached this decision with the highest consideration for our esteemed customers who have been faced with uncertainty over the last few days and to enable them to have access to travel to their various destinations for the time being during the period of discussions with relevant authorities,\u201d the AON said.\n\nThe statement was signed by the AON President, Alhaji Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina, his vice, Mr. Allen Onyema and five other members.\n\nThe body said: \u201cIn view of the above and in the interest of national economy and security considerations, AON hereby wishes to notify the general public that the earlier announced shutdown of operations on May 9, 2022 is hereby suspended in good faith pending the outcome of hopefully fruitful engagement with the government.\u201d\n\nOn the decision by some members to back out, the body said: \u201cAON however regrets the unfortunate position taken by one of our members, Ibom Air, not to stand by the collective decision. While they may have their reasons for doing what they did, it is pertinent to note that they equally accepted in their statement that the JetA1 situation poses an \u201cexistential threat to the air transport industry in Nigeria\u201d and that \u201cthe out-of-control situation is simply unsustainable.\u201d\n\nBlueprint gathered that the disunity among the operators will lead to further implosion as suspicion is rife within the body.\n\nSome operators decided to take advantage of the situation and further increase air fares for the few days the action could possibly last.\n\nFG lauds AON\n\nCommending the decision of some operators to back out, the federal government said the ministry of aviation had always made conscious efforts to assist members of the AON \u201csome of which includes facilitating a meeting between the Association and Mr. President, during which the Association got several concessions, including duty-free importation of aircraft, engines, spare parts and components.\u201d\n\nHe said at various times, he personally took members of the association to engage with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to sort out issues of access to Foreign Exchange (FOREX) for their operations, and also the NNPC to exploit ways of ensuring the availability of Aviation fuel (JET A1) through importation or from the major Marketers.\n\n\u201cIt should also be recalled that members of the Association were also considered for, and given Bail-out funds to the tune of N4 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that they remained afloat. This was without prejudice to the fact that most of them were heavily indebted to Aviation agencies (as they still are).\n\n\u201cWe believe that members of the Association are patriots who have continued to bear the brunt of an unfavourable oil market for which we salute their doggedness. It is gratifying that members of the Association have started reviewing the decision to withdraw flight services, with Ibom Air, Green Africa Airlines, Arik Air, Dana and others confirming that they will carry on with their normal flight schedules. We hope that other members will consider the expected impact on businesses and individuals and review their decision.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to assure foreign airlines operating in the country that all logistics and services for their operations remain in place as usual and that no disruptions whatsoever should be envisaged.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we reiterate our commitment to the continued growth of the aviation industry where airlines and other service providers operate in a profitable and competitive environment.\u201d Senator Sirika noted in an electronic statement on Sunday,\u201d the minister said.\n\nART fumes\n\nMeanwhile, the President of Aviation Round Table (ART), Dr. Gabriel Olowo said AON could not shut down airlines operations \u201cbecause It\u2019s un Nigerian to cooperate, collaborate and or consolidate for common courses such as this, hence we wouldn\u2019t be at this stage.\n\n\u201cAviation Fuel has been an issue for upwards of 20 years in Nigeria without serious attention, yet airlines keep operating out of being patriotic.\u201d\n\nOlowo added that \u201cregrettably this is planning for an accident. Please heed the voice of the watchman. God forbid. This has been the essence of my consistent advocacy for upward review of tariffs all the time. But how high can tariffs go given the average passenger purchasing power?\n\n\u201cIf any Airline pretends about this problem , such Airline must be receiving subsidies for the business or \u201ccutting corners\u201d. No operational & management skill can answer for this uncontrollable factor of the business.\n\n\u201cMy take, government must provide a lasting solution once and for all at this time. While I also appeal to the Airlines to heed the Minister\u2019s appeal to endure and stretch a little more but NOT beyond their elastic limit.\u201d\n\nFuel queues return\n\nMeanwhile, queues for fuel have returned to filling stations in Abuja with motorists spending an average of two hours to get the commodity.\n\nBlueprint observed Sunday that most fuel stations didn\u2019t have fuel while a few which had the commodity in stock, had long queues, making motorists to through the harrowing experience experienced some two months ago.\n\nThe scarcity has opened the way for black marketers who now make brisk business, selling a ten-liter gallon of fuel for as high as N3,000.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

After several engagements, President Muhammadu Buhari, approved the implementation of 9.7% increase in the pensions of Ex-PHCN Retirees under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS).

Remember that it is about food and nutritional security, the well-being of our farmers, improved income and less use of chemical sprays for environmental sustainability,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the safety of the improved PBR Cowpea, the director-general, National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, assured Nigerians the crop is safe for both human consumption and the environment.\n\nHe stressed that the PBR, genetically-modified with a non-harmful substance sourced from the soil (Bacillus Thuringiensis) that resists insect attacks and infestation of the staple food, was subjected to several rigorous risks analysis and safety tests by the Federal Government before approval for public consumption.\n\nAlso, the country coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology OFAB, Nigeria chapter, Dr. Rose Gidado, said Nigeria has etched her place in the comity of nations with the commercialisation of the PBR Cowpea. Nigeria\u2019s action, she said, has caused other African nations to come learn from her success. She stressed there is no difference between the conventional cowpea and the modified one. \u201cApart from being resistant to insects, they share the same characteristics in taste, colour, texture etc.\u201d",

More than 97% of the Election Committee voted in a secret ballot Sunday morning.\n\nHis appointment is widely seen as an attempt by the Chinese government to tighten its grip on the city.\n\nSunday\u2019s election comes after significant changes were made to Hong Kong\u2019s electoral laws last year to ensure that only patriots loyal to Beijing can hold office. In order to effectively eliminate opposition voices, the legislature was also reorganized.\n\nLee will replace current leader Carrie Lam on July 1.\n\nThree members of the League of Social Democrats, a local activist group, attempted to march toward the election venue Sunday morning while carrying a banner demanding universal suffrage, which would allow Hong Kongers to vote for both the legislature and the chief executive.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy camp has long demanded universal suffrage, which they claim is guaranteed in the city\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law. It was also a major demand during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution and the 2019 anti-government protests.\n\nThe election of Lee as Hong Kong\u2019s next leader has raised fears that Beijing will tighten its grip on the territory. He spent the majority of his civil service career in the police and security bureau, and he is an outspoken and ardent supporter of a national security law enacted in Hong Kong in 2020 to quell dissent.\n\nOver 150 people have been detained under the security law, which criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to meddle in city affairs. Almost all prominent pro-democracy activists have been imprisoned, while others have fled to other countries or have been forced to remain silent.\n\nAs a result of the 2019 protests and subsequent harsh pandemic restrictions, thousands of residents, including many professionals and expatriates, have fled the city of 7.4 million people.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Oil Marketers Raise the Alarm, Accuse Airline Operators of Trying to Force Subsidy on Aviation Fuel",
          "text": "Some petroleum products marketers in Nigeria have warned that the pressure being mounted by local airline operators on the federal government to begin arbitrary control of the price of Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), commonly known as aviation fuel, was to force government to introduce subsidy payment on the product.\n\nThe allegation came as Nigerian airlines once again demonstrated inability to work together in pursuit of common goals, as they pulled out of an earlier agreement to ground their flights from Monday to protest increase in the price of aviation fuel, also known as Jet A1. The withdrawal forced the umbrella organisation, Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), to stop the plan.\n\nAccording to the oil marketers, if government yields to the pressure to control the price of aviation fuel by \u201cfiat\u201d and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited begins to import and sell to the airline operators below the market price, the situation would lead to another subsidy and further compound the already bleeding economy. The immediate past chairman of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, said this in a chat with THISDAY on Sunday, after the earlier threat by the local airline operators to shut down their operations on Monday, following the rise in the price of aviation fuel to N700 per litre, as against N190 sold previously, as the airline operators claimed.\n\nOyebanji stated that the airline operators were trying to force the federal government to start controlling the prices of aviation fuel by fiat. He said the only solution was for airline passengers to pay the appropriate price for tickets to enable the operators recoup their expenses.\n\nOyebanji said, \u201cAirline Operators are trying to pressurise government to control prices by fiat. In the alternative, let people pay the appropriate price for airline tickets. Aviation is not a social welfare business. Why are international airlines that we also sell to, not threatening to stop flights?\u201d\n\nHe wondered why the airline operators had not been able to proceed with their plan to import aviation fuel even after the opportunity was given to them.\n\nMaintaining that the price of ATK followed the international price of the product and the exchange rate, the marketer said the cost of importing the product was high.\n\nOn his part, the current chairman, MOMAN, and Chief Executive Officer of Ardova Plc, Mr. Olumide Adeosun, told THISDAY that the Russia-Ukraine war, foreign exchange scarcity, inflation, as well as logistics and administration costs were major drivers of the rising price of aviation fuel at the international and local markets.\n\nAdeosun said traders of the product at the international market were now putting premium on demand and supply and were selling their products to the highest bidder, making it difficult for them to import the product and sell at a cheaper rate.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cRussia controls over 30 per cent production. What we are seeing is that traders are putting premium attention on the price of aviation fuel because all of us are scrambling for exactly the same barrel.\n\n\u201cSo, the traders are paying premium attention on demand and supply and they are selling to the highest bidders only. We should try and look at the financial factors and the predominant driver, look at all of the issues around storage cost, administration cost, and, of course, you have to think about where you are going to buy your next round of products from.\u201d\n\nNoting that the international carriers were not complaining that the price of ATK had gone up, as the hike affected everybody, Adeosun pointed out that, unlike the local operators, international airlines operated their business in ways that gave them long term security of product. He explained that the international airlines entered into long-term contracts, which allowed them to secure products supply for a long time and be able to pre-empt the price of ATK on a month-on-month basis.\n\nAdeosun stated that in Nigeria, the airline operators basically bought on the days they needed to fly, stressing, \u201cYou cannot do that when your business is dependent on the availability of fuel. Aviation fuel is not like petrol for taxi. You are not driving Uber. So, this is a very serious business that requires strategic planning.\u201d\n\nOn whether any of the airline operators had applied and secured licence to import aviation fuel, as they had said in February, the MOMAN chair said none of them had applied for the licence, to the best of his knowledge.\n\nAON Aborts Plan to Suspend Flight Operations\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement issued on Sunday, AON announced the suspension of its plan to halt operations. The statement was jointly signed by AON President, Alhaji Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina; Executive Director, Max Air, Alhaji Shehu Wada; Chairman, United Nigeria Airlines, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo; CEO, Arik Air, Capt. Roy Ilegbodu; CEO, Aero Contractors, Capt. Abdullahi Mahmood; MD, Azman Air, Alhaji Faisal Abdulmunaf; and Chairman, Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cFurther to numerous calls from the highest echelons in government with promises to urgently intervene in the crises being faced by airlines due to the astronomic and continuously rising cost of JetA1, that the AON has acceded to requests to withdraw the action for the time being while we allow for a fresh round of dialogue with government in the hope of reaching an amicable solution.\u201d\n\nThe airline operators also stated that they \u201creached this decision with the highest consideration for our esteemed customers who have been faced with uncertainty over the last few days and to enable them to have access to travel to their various destinations for the time being during the period of discussions with relevant authorities.\u201d\n\nThey said, \u201cIn the interest of national economy and security considerations, AON hereby wishes to notify the general public that the earlier announced shutdown of operations on May 9, 2022 is hereby suspended in good fate pending the outcome of hopefully fruitful engagement with government.\u201d\n\nBut before AON issued the statement, majority of Nigerian domestic carriers had suspended the plan to stop flight service from today. Leading the pack was Ibom Air, which on Saturday, broke off from the agreement and announced that it would continue operation.\n\nDana Air followed and said, in a statement signed by its management, that it had obligation to its customers and, therefore, would not stop operation on Monday.\n\nGreen Africa never indicated intention to join the airlines that wanted to embark on suspension of flight operations. But Aero Contractors and Arik Air issued a statement indicating their plan to continue with their flights. Overland Airways announced that it was opting out of the plan to stop operation.\n\nDana Air, in its statement, explained, \u201cWhile Dana Air agrees with the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) on all the challenges facing domestic airlines in Nigeria and have on many occasions actively participated in the collective and ongoing engagement of relevant authorities on the urgent need to tackle the many issues domestic airlines have been grappling with, which includes the skyrocketing cost of Jet A1, we have taken a decision not to join the suspension of flights on May 9, 2022.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, Arik Air and Aero Contractors said, \u201cThe management of Arik Air Limited (In Receivership) and Aero Contractors (In Receivership) wish to bring to the notice of the traveling public that both airlines will be operating all their scheduled flights on Monday, May 9, 2022.\u201d\n\nIt was only Max Air, Air Peace, and Azman Air that held on until AON issued a statement suspending the plan to ground airlines operations from Monday.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, commended the airlines for suspending the planned suspension of flights. In a statement signed by Special Assistant to the Minister of Aviation on Public Affairs, James Odaudu, Sirika said since members of the AON issued the notice of withdrawal of flight services as a result of rising cost of Jet A1, and in spite of the initial statement by the ministry, enquiries had flooded the ministry. It said some had thought the withdrawal of flight operations was a kind of protest against the government.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe wish to state that the decision of the association is purely a business one as they are private businesses reacting to market forces but appealing for interventions to enable them carry on with their operations.\n\n\u201cThe ministry has always made conscious efforts to assist members of the Airline Operators of Nigeria, some of which includes facilitating a meeting between the association and Mr. President, during which the association got several concessions, including duty-free importation of aircraft, engines, spare parts and components.\u201d\n\nIt also stated that the minister had at various times personally took members of the association to engage with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to sort out issues of access to forex for their operations and also the NNPC to explore ways of ensuring the availability of aviation fuel.\n\nHowever, the plan by labour unions in four aviation agencies to embark on two-day warning strike on Monday and Tuesday, May 9 and 10, over the non-implementation of the Minimum Wage Consequential Adjustment, still stands, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE), Ocheme Aba, confirmed on Sunday that there had been no development to stop the plan and the strike would still go on.\n\nThe Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP); Amalgamated Union of Public Corporation, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE); and NUATE issued a statement at the weekend, saying despite their best efforts, the issue of the Conditions of Service of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET), Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), and Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), as negotiated for upwards of seven years, remained with the National Salaries Income and Wages Commission (NSIWC) and the Minimum Wage Consequential Adjustment remained unimplemented since 2019.\n\nAba added, \u201cAll workers in NAMA, NCAA, NiMET and NCAT are hereby directed to embark on a two-day warning strike on May 9 and 10, 2022. Should the warning go unheeded, an indefinite strike shall be called soon afterwards. However, workers in all aviation organisations, including FAAN and AIB, are hereby directed to support and operate with the unions to assure full compliance and success of the strike.\u201d\n\nAviation Fuel: House Calls Off Planned Emergency Plenary Session\n\nThe leadership of the House of Representatives cancelled its planned emergency plenary session slated for Monday, to discuss critical issues of national importance relating to the ongoing crisis in the country\u2019s aviation sector. Clerk to the House of Representatives, Dr. Yahaya Danzaria, had on Saturday issued a circular calling on all members of the House, legislative staff, the media, and the general public to note that the House was going to reconvene by 2pm on Monday, to deliberate on the said matters.\n\nBut in a new circular, the House, through the Clerk, reversed the decision to sit on Monday, as earlier announced, citing, \u201cnear resolution of critical issues in the aviation industry.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the leadership would, however, meet with industry stakeholders to deliberate on the way forward.\n\nThe new circular read, \u201cI am directed to inform all Hon Members, staff, media, and the general public that the House hereby cancels the emergency plenary session earlier scheduled for tomorrow 9th May 2022.\n\n\u201cThis cancellation follows from the near-resolution of some of the major critical issues in the aviation industry that necessitated the original notice. The House appreciates the positive concern, reaction, and contributions of all Hon Members to these critical national issues.\u201d\n\nChinedu Eze, Peter Uzoho in Lagos, Udora Orizu and Kasim Sumaina in Abuja",

          "text": "Some African leaders have mounted pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to anoint President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election, THISDAY learnt at the weekend.\n\nA reliable source told THISDAY that leaders in West Africa, including the presidents of Niger and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, might have spoken to Buhari on behalf of the AfDB president. The West African leaders are meeting Buhari in Abidjan on Monday and Tuesday, at a two-day conference organised by the United Nations, on the future of land, regarding desertification, drought, degradation, rights, restoration and implications for national and world economies.. Their mission? To try and persuade him to consider Adesina. This, it was gathered, was what encouraged a coalition of support groups to purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms for the president of the continental bank.\n\nHowever, the coalition of support groups that purchased the presidential nomination form for President of the African Development Bank, Akinwunmi Adesina, has lamented that it has not been able to convince him to contest the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary election.\n\nAt the weekend, the coalition of 28 support groups had paid for his presidential nomination form.\n\nWhile addressing journalists in Abuja, yesterday, the President of One Nigeria Group, Mohammed Saleh, said their quest to seek a solution to the myriad of challenges confronting the country informed their decision to drag him into the race.\n\nHe described Adesina as a man of proven integrity and experience, saying he performed well for Nigeria as Minister for Agriculture.\n\n\u201cHe has solved the problems of so many farmers, created so many jobs by solving the corruption in the agricultural sector. Particularly the fertilizer, which he brought the e-wallet for fertilizer which the farmers are enjoying now, and it has created a lot of jobs,\u201d Saleh explained.\n\n\u201cIt has also helped millions of farmers in Nigeria, which they are still benefiting from and also as president of African Development Bank, he has brought a lot of initiatives that solve Africa\u2019s food security problem. So, we will like him to come back home and apply it here in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn how Adesina would woo delegates to vote for him, he noted that the most important thing for the group now was to get Adesina to agree to join the race.\n\n\u201cWhen we get there, we\u2019ll cross that bridge, don\u2019t worry about that. First and foremost, the most significant thing is for us to get him to agree and come and collect the form, sign it for us and then join the race. That is the most significant thing at the moment,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIssues of delegates and everybody I know all Nigerians apart from not even the delegates even you, everybody in Nigeria knows that Adesina has the capacity to bring Nigeria back from the brink.\u201d\n\nAlso, the leader and founder of the Youth Arise Movement, Babatunde Ademola, said he was one of the group leaders working tirelessly and consulting across the country and even outside the country to ensure that they get him to come and obey the clarion call.\n\n\u201cI will tell you significantly that we have tried to reach out to him. We have sent messages. We have not gotten any definite response from him,\u201d explained Ademola. \u201cWe need Dr Adesina to come and solve Nigeria\u2019s problem, and because of this, we have put our resources together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to gather N100 million, but we have ensured that we gather as many people as possible. So we are calling him to come out and accept this form from us,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIs a gift to serve this country and solve our problems. We are calling Adesina because it\u2019s a call to save Nigeria, and I think he is going to accept.\u201d",
