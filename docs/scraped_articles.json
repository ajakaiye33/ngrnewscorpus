          "title": "Why Nigeria needs Umahi as President in 2023 \u2014 Ebonyi Commissioner",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nAS the clamour for the next President of the country gathers momentum in the South-East geopolitical zone, many groups and individuals in Ebonyi State are currently carrying a campaign that Governor David Umahi has what it takes to change the present narrative of the country in 2023.\n\nThe Commissioner for Capital City and Urban Development, Ebonyi State, Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi, in a statement issued in Abakaliki, explained that the Governor\u2019s achievements in the area of road construction cannot be equalled by any Governor or President since Nigeria\u2019s Independence as he has embarked on aggressive road construction in all the 13 Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State.\n\nAccording to him, Governor Umahi, in his knowingness of the intricacies of the drivers of development, opted to tackle infrastructure headlong upon his assumption of office as governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cIt is axiomatic that nobody has equalled Governor Umahi since Nigeria\u2019s Independence, be it President or Governor. Upon the inception of his administration, Governor Umahi wasted no time in embarking on aggressive road construction in all the 13 local government areas of Ebonyi State. He saw rural roads as important as urban roads and highways, which made him come up with the 15 kilometers rural road per LGA policy.\n\nThe Commissioner who stressed that Ebonyi State has the best road networks and highest number of flyovers in the country added that \u201cdue to the premium the Governor places on transportation, he has also embarked on the construction of an ultramodern international Airport to open up Ebonyi State to transnational trade.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that investing in sustainable infrastructure is germane to addressing crucial challenges facing Nigeria at the moment: poverty, insecurity, and economic downturn.\n\n\u201cPhysical infrastructure is such a crucial element to a nation\u2019s development due to the fact that it engenders efficient distribution of goods and services. What this means is that every sector of the economy thrives. Producers will have the zeal for proactive and more efficient production, and distributors too since the goods and services produced to reach the consumers with ease. Similarly, good roads are also needed for manufacturers to obtain raw materials and other components needed for effective production.\n\n\u201cIn view of these reasons, it is vital that physical infrastructure needs to be as efficient and as productive as possible. That is why Governor Umahi, in his knowingness of the intricacies of the drivers of development, opted to tackle infrastructure headlong upon his assumption of office as Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cTalking of road infrastructure, it is axiomatic that nobody has equalled Governor Umahi since Nigeria\u2019s Independence, be it President or Governor. Upon the inception of his administration, Governor Umahi wasted no time in embarking on aggressive road construction in all the 13 local government areas of Ebonyi State. He saw rural roads as important as urban roads and highways, which made him come up with the 15 kilometres of rural road per LGA policy.\n\n\u201cYet, due to his frugality and shrewd experience in engineering, the costs of the projects were so minimal that he extended them far beyond the 15 kilometres in every local government area. It is evident that today, Ebonyi State has the best road network in Nigeria and is one of the states with the highest number of flyovers. Due to the premium the Governor places on transportation, he has also embarked on the construction of an ultramodern international Airport to open up Ebonyi State to transnational trade.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the areas Nigeria as a country is lagging behind at the moment and as such, needs Engr. Chief David Nweze Umahi as President in 2023 to fix the infrastructural deficit before it becomes irremediable.\n\n\u201cIndeed, while many people talk about physical infrastructure and human empowerment, they miss out on the real essence of human capital development. The real essence of human capital development, or human empowerment if the parlance goes so, is not sharing money to individuals but, the skills of the workforce and their productivity and productive capacities.\n\n\u201cThis aspect is developed through investments in healthcare and education, which in turn, enables a healthy and well-educated workforce. The availability of such a workforce then leads to faster economic growth by ensuring that the necessary human resources are there for the industries and the technology companies to take advantage of. Human capital development also means that the infrastructures needed for entrepreneurship to thrive are in place.\n\n\u201cIn this wise, Governor Umahi has got it perfectly right, but for the fact that Ebonyi State is a microcosm of the Nigerian society and could not significantly direct the movement of the economy of the country explains why the impacts of his accomplishments are still trickling down.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, another important element in a nation\u2019s infrastructure is Urban Planning. The manner in which the urban areas are planned and managed determines how the living standard of its citizens is rated and how fast the economy grows. It is trite to say here that most Nigerian cities are creaking under the weight of their residents and transit population, as a result of poor or lack of planning.\n\n\u201cThis leads to haphazard development, poor sanitary conditions, and infrastructural decay. This is why the Ebonyi State Ministry of Capital City and Urban Development employs austere measures, on the instruction of the most astute governor, Engr. Chief David Nweze Umahi, to implement the original plan of the capital city and maintain the statutory standards.\n\n\u201cIndeed, among the things holding back Nigeria, sheer lack of planning, as far as cities and the other components of the infrastructure are concerned, is a notable factor. For a nation to advance, there is no alternative to infrastructure development and there are no shortcuts to faster economic growth.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to leapfrog into the elite club of developed nations, which most Nigerians yearn for, Engr. Chief David Umahi needs to be the next president of the country. This is because he will invest in all elements of the infrastructure component which will restore Nigeria as the giant of Africa and project it to the status of a developed nation.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing, it is undeniable that if Nigerians fail to elect Governor David Umahi as president in 2023, Nigeria will miss the train again and lose out in the race for economic competitiveness in the comity of nations. This is the hard truth and the bitter reality which should spur Nigerian youths to look inwards and go for Engr. Umahi, the man who knows the way, in 2023 in order to achieve their collective aspirations.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Follow Buhari\u2019s footsteps, accept Fani-Kayode \u2014 PGF DG charges APC members",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nDirector-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman has charged members of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC to show greater understanding and accept a former Aviation Minister, Chief Femi Fani Kayode into their fold.\n\nLukman in a statement titled, \u201cAPC\u2019s High-Profile Membership Recruitment and Issues for 2023\u201d issued Sunday in Abuja advised aggrieved party members against protesting the red carpet reception offered Mr Kayode saying if President Muhammadu Buhari and party leaders have accepted him, then party members should not be more catholic than the Pope.\n\nLukman said; \u201cAlmost every member of APC is angry that our leaders have brought someone like Mr. Fani-Kayode into our party. This is made worse by the red-carpet reception given to him, which he doesn\u2019t deserve. But since it has happened, there is no need to cry over spilt milk.\n\n\u201cWhat is very clear is that our leaders, especially President Buhari have forgiven Mr Fani-Kayode and embrace him as one of us. As members of APC, our anger with Mr Fani-Kayode is that he has abused both the APC, President Buhari and virtually every leader of the party. For instance, he claimed that the \u2018emergence of Buhari in 2015 annihilated Nigeria and plunged her into darkness, death and destruction. He came to steal, kill and destroy and for the last disastrous 5 years that is all he has done.\u2019 More than this, he has said unprintable things against the APC and all its leaders.\n\n\u201cAt this point, therefore, if with all these, our leaders can accept Mr Fani-Kayode into the party, APC members should not be more Catholic than the Pope. Why should APC members be sad that our leaders are magnanimous? Perhaps, because of the red-carpet reception, which many committed APC members cannot even dream of, it should be legitimate to feel unappreciated like Mr Joe Igbokwe had cried out.\n\n\u201cBut as APC members, especially those who have been in the party since its formation in 2013 and have endured all the challenges of being loyal members, we must always be reminded that our commitment is to contribute in whatever way and manner possible to change Nigeria for the better.\n\n\u201cIf therefore, someone like Mr Fani-Kayode, who is considered unreliable and therefore not qualified to be a member, would seek for forgiveness from our leaders, based on which they extended their arms to him, members of the APC should also show understanding\u201d.\n\nHe said what is required in the circumstance is for APC leaders to test the commitment of Mr. Fani-Kayode to reform himself.\n\n\u201cThe first test is that Mr Fani-Kayode should be reminded that politics is local. Coming from Osun State, his commitment to reform himself should start with getting him to integrate himself with APC leaders back in Osun State.\n\n\u201cAt this early stage of his membership of APC, beyond the photo show with our dear President Buhari and the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee, Mr Fani-Kayode should have a photo gallery with images of him uniting with Chief Bisi Akande, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, Governor Gboyega Oyetola and other party leaders in his home state, Osun.\n\n\u201cIn fact, part of this test would have been met had Governor Oyetola and Ogbeni Aregbesola, at the minimum, been part of the welcome reception at the Presidential Villa on Thursday, September 16. Had that happened, the raging controversy following the admission of Mr Fani-Kayode into the party would have been minimised.\n\n\u201cThe photo gallery should also cover images with leaders from the South-West. Mr Fani-Kayode should take every step to reciprocate the gesture of our leaders by demonstrating that he is ready to reform himself. Some of the controversies he has already created make it doubtful whether he wants to reform himself at all.\n\n\u201cFor instance, when he claimed that he facilitated the defection of some Governors that joined the APC from PDP, suggests that he is still his old venomous self. Only people with very small minds could make such statements and only gullible people can believe them\u201d, Lukman declared.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Tiv National Volunteers for Buhari Worldwide and National Leader of Tiv Muslims Worldwide, has assured that the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom harbours no hatred for President Muhammadu Buhari and the Fulani tribe.\n\nAlhaji Sadiq Tyomanger, National Leader of the group, also known as Tiv Buharist, said Ortom appointed 14 Fulani aborigines into his government in 2015.\n\nTyomanger made the remark while backing the state on the implementation of the anti-open grazing law.\n\nIn a statement he signed, Tyomanger recalled that Ortom once appointed Miyetti Allah leader in the state, Alhaji Garus Gorolo as Senior Special Adviser on Fulani Affairs.\n\nAccording to Tyomanger: \u201cIt has become necessary to debunk the claims that His Excellency, Samuel Ortom, Executive Governor of Benue State hates Fulani ethnic nationals.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, I am Alhaji Sadiq Tyomanger, the National Leader of the famous Tiv National Volunteers for Buhari worldwide. I also double as the National Leader of Tiv Muslims worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that Governor Ortom, on assumption of office in 2015 appointed 14 Fulani aborigines into his Government including the leader of Miyetti Allah in the state, Alhaji Garus Gorolo who served as the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Fulani Affairs. Gololo is of Fulani from Adamawa State.\n\n\u201cWith all these appointments made to these sons and daughters of Fulani nationality, we can\u2019t figure out where the Ortom Government has indicated any single trace of hatred on the fulani people as a tribe.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate and pure act of mischief that rather than applaud Governor Samuel Ortom for his magnanimity to the Fulani as a race, criminal elements within their fold are bent on destroying the peace in the state thereby undermining the government and its people.\n\n\u201cThis is evident in their total disregard to the Anti-Open Grazing Law of the state, unprovoked attacks on farming communities in the state and owing up to the killing in the media including on National TV.\n\n\u201cThey have therefore, rendered hundreds of thousands displaced and are living in IDPs camps. It is disheartening and sickening.\n\n\u201cNo nation of the world to the best of my knowledge apart from Nigeria is still talking about open grazing or cattle routes hence ranching is the only way to go when it comes to the business of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that the entire Benue society is behind the Anti Open-Grazing Law of the state for the purpose of stemming the tide of incessant herdsmen/farmers crisis.\n\n\u201cTiv Buharists are therefore, standing with Governor Samuel Ortom, the government and people of Benue State on the state\u2019s Anti Open-grazing Law and its implementation. We are totally not in support of any grazing route of any kind in view of the increasing population density and fixed landmass. Any other archaic animal husbandry policy is rejected.\u201d\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to consider ranching as a panacea to open grazing of cattle.\n\nTyomanger insisted that cattle grazing routes would not be possible in the State.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhy is the Federal Government not talking about ranching? Why are they suddenly insisting on going back to the impossible archaic cattle grazing routes?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not deceive ourselves. The cattle grazing routes will not be possible in Benue State for now.\u201d\n\nHe called on Buhari to exempt Benue State from the grazing route policies of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore calling on the Federal Government of President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), to kindly count Benue out of his grazing routes policy and find a way of returning our farmers back to their ancestral homes.\n\n\u201cAnd, again if Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, has in one swoop, given appointments to 14 core Fulani nationals, cutting across Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Zamfara, Kebbi, Adamawa, Plateau and Taraba states, and you still shout hate, then I don\u2019t know how else to display love and brotherhood to Fulani as a tribe,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Defection: Why Northern oligarchy is pushing for Jonathan",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere are strong indications of looming fresh crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the entrant of the former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode and the proposed plan to bring in former President Goodluck Jonathan into the ruling party.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on Thursday, last week, at the State House Abuja, formally received Fani-Kayode into the party in company of the National Chairman, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Zamfara Governor, Bello Mohammed Matawale, while the planned entrant of former President Jonathan has remained in the realm of speculation.\n\nThe entrant of the former Aviation Minister and Jonathan\u2019s proposed crossing over to the ruling party have continued to generate hostile, negative criticisms and cold reception from party chieftains instead of celebrating what many would consider the capture of two big fishes.\n\nIn a chat with Sunday Sun, an APC chieftain who craved anonymity queried why Fani-Kayode should claim Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as ward instead of joining the party from his ward in his state, Osun.\n\nHe argued that a party like the APC battling image problem ought not to admit certain persons in its desperation to increasing membership base.\n\nThe chieftain alleged that the reason behind Northern oligarchy desperately wanting to lure former President Jonathan is just to satisfy the yearnings of the South for power rotation, explaining that with Jonathan, the South will only have a shot at power for just four years.\n\nCommenting on Fani-Kayode\u2019s defection, the chieftain said: \u201cAre you aware that Fani-Kayode is not joining from his ward in Osun State? For your information, he is joining APC from the FCT, but the big questions are, first, why is he joining APC from the FCT instead of his ward in his state? Could it be that his ward and by extension, his state, is not welcoming him?\n\n\u201cEvery other member of the ruling party, including those that took him to the State House and Buhari who received him all joined the party from their wards. How can Buhari who joined the party from his ward in Daura tolerate such? I can tell you that his entrant is a bitter pill for many APC members I have interacted with.\u201d\n\nBut Fani-Kayode in a national TV programme claimed that he has lived in the FCT for over 20 years and, therefore, has every right to join the APC from there.\n\nReacting to the speculation that Fani-Kayode was brought into the party for certain hatchet jobs, our source replied: \u201cIf they claim that we brought him for a hatchet job, it is not an unexpected speculation because in the minds of many, he has record of doing hatchet jobs. I can tell you that his entry into APC will widen the cracks within the party because he even came at the wrong time.\n\n\u201cFor a party struggling to redeem its public image, this is apparently a wrong time to admit anybody with any iota of credibility doubt. Yes, I am aware that he forced himself on APC, but this is the wrong time for him to join. When the time comes, I will tell you the real reason he joined the APC\u201d.\n\nAdvising Jonathan to resist the temptation and remain with the opposition party, PDP, the source, however, warned that he will run into more problems pushing his desperation too far as he would still run into constitutional lacuna of swearing him in two times again.\n\n\u201cSome top members of APC majorly of northern extraction actually started the move to lure Jonathan into the party based on their selfish reasons and I can confirm to you that they have really gone very far into the deal. Part of the plot to settle for him is that the odd will favour them since he has only a term to serve.\n\n\u201cThey have perfected arrangements to ensure that one of them becomes Jonathan\u2019s vice preparatory to taking over from him if he finishes his remaining term. This move is purely a northern affair and they are not relenting about it regardless of the effect it will have on the party.\n\n\u201cThose opting for him forgot that Jonathan\u2019s return has a constitutional lacuna where a section has a proviso that he cannot be sworn in as President for more than two times. If APC issues Jonathan presidential ticket, the party is running a big risk due to that lacuna unless there is amendment of the constitution at the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, plans are at an advanced stage for the ruling party to constitute a high-power zoning committee to articulate the party\u2019s zoning arrangement ahead of its National Convention and 2023 presidential election in an attempt to avert implosion in the party.\n\nA source close to the national leadership of the party made the disclosure in a chat with Sunday Sun, emphasising that toeing the path of the opposition party, the PDP, has become very necessary to reduce the ever-escalating tension over which zone gets what.\n\n\u201cWe have not actually started anything about zoning, but I can tell you on good authority that there is every likelihood that we may have to set up zoning committee, just like the PDP did, to evolve acceptable arrangement and resolve the delicate issue of which zone gets what position.\n\n\u201cHowever, regardless of what the report of the zoning committee might contain, I can confirm to you that the Southeast is still the beautiful bride. The agitation and actualisation of Igbo presidency may be a remote possibility to many party members, but the good thing is that the dream is very much alive. I am not oblivious of the fact that the powers that be will certainly decide who becomes the party\u2019s national chairman and gets the presidential ticket in 2023,\u201d the source quipped.\n\nXXX\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Cosmas Omegoh\n\nAs the third wave of Coronavirus is raging and currently wreaking havoc in communities across the country, some survivors have come out to recount the pain and anguish they went through.\n\nTheir testimonies send clear warning signals to the citizenry that COVID-19 is still dangling overhead like the proverbial Sword of Damocles, though many are yet to realise the looming danger, let alone acknowledging it.\n\nOur correspondent\u2019s recent encounters with COVID-19 victims and the pain they went through come across as real eye opener. Everything points to one direction: that all and sundry must be careful; everyone needs to exercise a lot of personal responsibility and caution to remain alive.\n\nRecalling her experience, Evelyn (not her real name) who contracted COVID-19 recently noted that \u201cas soon as I tested positive for the virus, I rushed to one of the government facilities immediately.\n\n\u201cMy ordeal started with fever, catarrh and cough. Gradually I began to experience sore throat; I later noticed that I was losing my appetite; even while I struggled to eat, I discovered that the taste of the food was gone.\n\n\u201cAt the hospital, the first doctor I encountered was kind and friendly. He asked a nurse to check my body parameters which were discovered to be okay. My case was not alarming yet.\n\n\u201cAfter the drugs were written out, I was told to go home and isolate; I was assured that I would be fine as long as I took my medication religiously.\u201d\n\nShe further recalled that \u201cbecause of the increasing number of patients seeking cure in Lagos, I gathered that the bed spaces were getting scarcer. Where they were available, they were reserved for those whose cases were critical.\n\n\u201cThe drugs I was not given at the hospital pharmacy I purchased elsewhere. Some were cheap while some were expensive. But does that matter when life is involved?\n\n\u201cIt was a horrible experience, but I gradually got better and became well after the 14-day window was over.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, daily report by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) shows rising number of infections. Deaths figures are mounting too.\n\n\u201cThe persons worst hit are older ones, particularly people with underlining ailments,\u201d a young Nigerian doctor and missionary, Rev. Sister (Dr) Luciana Agba, who has been working with COVID-19 patients told our correspondent over the telephone.\n\nShe listed some of the underlying ailments as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart or kidney problems among others, while warning everyone to be careful.\n\nDuring one of his briefing, the Lagos State governor, Jide Sanwo-Olu, noted that \u201cthe positivity rate in Lagos is 8.9 per cent,\u201d adding that \u201cthis is an eight-fold increase over the recorded figure a month ago, and it should rightly alarm all of us.\u201d\n\nRecent reports released by NCDC keep suggesting that the number of infections has maintained a steady rise. Yet, the residents seem not to be listening.\n\nTesting a big problem\n\nAccording to our investigation, testing for COVID-19 is a big challenge. Many who show symptoms don\u2019t really know what to do and where to go to. It was gathered that testing for COVID-19 is unlike testing for malaria or typhoid fevers. Far from that.\n\nOne of the testing centres in Lagos is at the Nigerian Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba.\n\nOur correspondent was told that getting a chance to be tested at the facility doesn\u2019t come easy.\n\nAccording to Tony, who was at the centre recently, the process is cumbersome.\n\n\u201cIt is not an exercise that allows one to walk in and get tested easily. It is a whole process, which could take hours depending on the crowd in attendance.\n\n\u201cIt again depends on who helps you or your savvy with your cell phone; for you are required to go online and fill out a whole form with your android phone to book for a date to come for the test. Later you receive an invitation for the testing.\n\n\u201cI wonder the fate of those who do not have phones capable of performing such operation?\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing how the test itself is carried out, he said: \u201cYou are given two swab sticks to insert into your nose and your throat. You then break the swabs into a tiny plastic container, hand it in and go home. Then within 48 hours, you receive a notification informing you whether you are positive or negative.\n\n\u201cIn my case, I tested negative; I give glory to God.\n\n\u201cBut what about the market women, the agbero in the streets and every other person who knows nothing about having an email to receive such notification?\u201d\n\nFurther investigation revealed that testing is not only key, but indeed the beginning of the journey to COVID-19 treatment. No doctor listens to a patient if they have no test result, not minding if they are showing clear symptoms of COVID-19 or not.\n\nIt was also learnt that after some people had tested positive, there is no clear directive as regards to where they should go to next.\n\nNo one is there to direct anyone. The patients are on their own. It is either they find their way to government facilities or end up in private hospitals \u2013 for those who can afford it anyway.\n\nPatients at Lagos facility\n\nAs the epicenter of COVID-19, Lagos has rallied to erect various isolation centres where patients could receive treatment. One, it was learnt, is at Gbagada General Hospital. Another is at Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), Yaba; then, there is one at Lagos State University (LASUTH), Ikeja, among others. Various general hospitals and designated primary health centres in the state also run skeletal services to assist those suspected to have contracted COVID-19. Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi Araba too runs a COVID-19 clinic.\n\nPrivate hospitals participation\n\nOur correspondent gathered that there are a number of private outfits in Lagos that are also taking care of COVID-19 patients especially the rich. Some of them, it was learnt, charge as highly as between N.5m -N1m per day.\n\nAccording to a source, soon after a certain young man lost his sibling to COVID-19, his mother also contracted the virus and died.\n\nThe tragedy went full circle when he too contracted the virus. He was rushed to a private hospital that billed N.5m daily for treatment. After days on admission, he asked to be discharged apparently because of the mounting bills; but resurgence occurred shortly after.\n\nThis time around, he was rushed to another clinic that charged N1 million daily. Friends and foes, it was disclosed, had to rally round by contributing huge sums to save his life.\n\nSituation at IDH, Yaba\n\nThe IDH at Yaba was built in those days of yore and many things bear clear testimonies to this fact.\n\nIt is located somewhere a shouting distance from the iconic West African Examination Council (WAEC) building in Yaba. As you cruise down the road leading to the facility, you pass through the Nigerian Army facilities on both sides. Then turning to the left, and to the right, huge tents built to receive, apparently high-profile patients , reveal themselves. Their rich white colours glitter in the mid-morning sun. Then a few metres ahead, one comes face to face with the old IDH facilities. The hospital was established to take care of patients suffering from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, Lassa fever and the like. COVID-19 was then well out of the way. But now, its sufferers have mostly occupied the hospital; a lot more people have continued to stream into the place in their numbers for treatment.\n\nOn approach, the environment is serene and quiet. A huge mango and a young guava tree seem to wave their welcome as they rock in the mild wind. The ambience gives out a false impression that all is well. But that is not the fact. At the facility, only a thin line separates life and death.\n\nTo the left hand side, some giant oxygen cylinders stood waiting to be cleared. Their contents had been spent \u2013 exhausted by individuals critically needing them to stay alive. Their presence lent credence to the earlier alarm raised by Governor Sanwo-Olu that many patients in the state needed oxygen to survive. He had informed that the state had activated oxygen plants to meet the growing needs of many residents in critical conditions.\n\nInches to the right sat rolls of seats for patients craving to see the doctors. Two patients, a middle-age man and a teenage girl sat diagonally apart. The man had his oxygen mask on, and was clearly battling for life. He was being attended to by a woman suspected to be his wife.\n\nUp there on the elevated corridor sat the medical team: doctors and nurses, attending to patients. They were not your usual run of mill doctors donning white clinical coats. They all wore combat gears \u2013 some green and some blue overalls with face masks firmly on and a special, uniform rubber footwear. Some wore double masks. They were out for battle because the enemy before them is high on guile \u2013 vicious, violent, virulent. Their patients consulted them standing. Call that unusual. But the situation calls for that.\n\nTwice, two ambulances cars arrived \u2013 one a Toyota Siena. The driver pulled the door open to reveal a man lying prostrate. Apparently afflicted by COVID-19, he lay helplessly and hopelessly guessing at the car roof \u2013 unsure of what the future held for him. You now get this felling that death is in the air.\n\nJust then, a sharp cry of anguish rang out, shattering the tranquility of the environment. Eyes turned in a direction deep inside the facility. A lady in her mid-30s was distraught. She was weeping and wailing uncontrollably, stamping her feet hard on the ground in sorrow and anguish. She was almost yanking off her hair and dress to underline her loss. Like the biblical Rachel, she was weeping for her relative because he/she was no more, apparently cut down by COVID-19.\n\nThe hospital staff carried on with their regular chores unperturbed. Some kept lumbering across the lawn separating the buildings unfazed, a clear sign that they had long been immune to such scenario. Only a few helpless visitors cared. Everyone had hands akimbo, wondering what was actually amiss.\n\nCost of getting to isolation centre\n\nA doctor who craved anonymity told our correspondent that some patients who had no cars of their own arrive at the facility at a huge cost to them and the society.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that some of the patients needing ambulance service pay as highly as N100,000 to get here.\n\n\u201cThose who have no one to bring them come here by public transport. They sit with other passengers on the bus. That is a warning that people must wear their face masks always, but it appears many are not listening to that. \u201cBefore the patients arrive here, some of them might even infect two to three persons sitting next to them,\u201d he said.\n\nNow the good news\n\nHowever, Dr Agba said that Coronavirus is not actually a death sentence.\n\n\u201cMany have been surviving the virus as long as they properly do what they are asked to do \u2013 isolate, take their medications, eat well and rest.\u201d\n\nHer assertion is buttressed by the huge number of people reported by the NCDC to have fully recovered from COVID-19.\n\nHowever, a source at LUTH told our correspondent that some survivors have had to deal with loss of taste or smell, learning to walk again among other issues.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

He then urged residents to endeavour to get vaccinated as soon as they could to stay safe, while expressing optimism that the world would get over the pandemic.",

          "title": "I dreamt of becoming a queen from childhood \u2013Yadera Nzimako,",
          "text": "By Agatha Emeadi\n\nMiss Yadera Nzimako was recently crowned Miss Bold and Beautiful Culture 2021 as the first runner-up at the Miss Bold and Beautiful Nigeria Pageant organised by Cherdah Republic.\n\nWinning at the contest with the theme: \u201cUnapologethick\u201d, an ostensibly excited Miss Nzimako told Sunday Sun that she is set to conquer the world as a plus-size model.\n\nShe said that she would be all out to promote, encourage, educate and motivate all plus-size girls to stand up and achieve their dreams.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) graduate bares her mind on her pet projects, which among others will see her reaching out to much younger school children who use degrading and derogatory words on their mates who are on the fat side. Excerpt:\n\nWhat is this Bold and Beautiful Nigerian Contest and how did it go?\n\nI contested in the Miss Bold and Beautiful Pageant, which is the biggest plus-size pageant in Nigeria. The event, which was organized by Cherdah Republic was held in Enugu State. I emerged the first runner-up with a crown, Miss Bold and Nigeria Culture 2021. There were three crowns given at the end of the show and they are Miss Bold and Beautiful Winner, Miss Bold and Beautiful Culture for the first runner-up and Miss Bold and Beautiful Elegance, second runner -up. Part of the reign for the crown is a one-year movie deal, we have travelled to Ohafia for the movie shooting.\n\nWhat attracted you into the Bold and Beautiful pageant?\n\nI have always wanted to put myself out there to prove something to the world. So, when the rare opportunity came up, a pageant with a plus-size emphasis, I did not think of any other event that would showcase the beauty of African woman more than this contest. I bought into it because African women are known to be plus sizes who celebrate their big boobs, bulging stomach, hips and fat arms. Yes, we are African women who are not ashamed of our body structure. Over time, I have been body-shamed, told of how fat, how big I have become; got names that are not befitting to me and all that. Therefore, the contest came at a time I need to make a point. I felt I should tell the world that plus sizes are models as well and not just anything. That was my main reason.\n\nHow was the crowning and the prize?\n\nFrom day one, we were lodged at Sunshine Hotel, New Haven Enugu, where we were taught how to sit like queens, inspirational talks of being big and not useless. And the contest came and passed. Now, we are waiting for the organizers to draft out our prizes so that we can sign and collect them. Honestly, it was a free and fair judgment because I did not know anybody except God. We started preparation for the contest since 2019. The criteria for the competition were for single size-12 ladies and above; then activities in the camp, voting, presentation of tickets etc. It was a big opportunity for plus-size ladies to prove a point. This is my first pageant, it was actually stressful, but let me recover from this first and focus on other things.\n\nWere you applauded and cheered during the preparation and contests?\n\nDuring the contest, I had mainly my family, friends and school mates. So many others followed me online, voted for me, send the support messages and bought their tickets. Every other person showed their support in ways they could.\n\nNow that the contest is over, what next?\n\nI would reign as Miss Bold and Beautiful Culture for one year and I hope to get back to the society to make a difference. One of my visions is to reach out to plus-size women within my reach to educate, encourage, motivate and speak on the importance of body-shaming and how it affects plus-size women; again, how people should cease from the use of abusive words on plus-size women. I will also talk about plus-size women\u2019s health; give them orientation that shows that a plus-size woman can also be healthy. I also have dreams of reaching out to destitute no matter how small, give school bags and sandals to a few that cannot afford it. Would really do some charity works to give back to the society the much I could. Again, like an adage says \u2018Catch them young\u2019; I would love to go to schools and caution children not to use derogatory language on plus-size mates. They do not know how damaging such abusive languages could be. They have to know that every child is beautiful in his or her own way. This body-shaming starts from such a tender age and eats into the fabric of the society as one matures and it never actually stops. Some of us still experience it, because your family wants the best for you, but such messages are wrongly sent at times. They say things like these days, no man wants to marry a plus- size woman.\n\nHow do you want to fund your pet projects?\n\nIf it means seeking public financial support, reaching out to friends to achieve my dreams; I would not mind. I know that when the times comes, I would speak to people who would buy into my idea, they would help no matter how little.\n\nWhat movie shooting are you expected to get involved in?\n\nWe went for our official photo-shoot to have photos of ourselves; but part of the package of our reign for the crown is one-year movie deal, we will travel to Ohafia, in Abia State for our first movie production.\n\nAfter the reign, what next?\n\nI will continue my life. I am yet to go for my National Youth Service Corps to serve my father land, which will come up and would closely be followed with a pursuit of my Master\u2019s Degree. Every other good thing that will come within my reign would be enjoyed after my reign. I\u2019m also open to becoming the face of big brands across the world as Miss Bold and Beautiful Culture queen.\n\nHow was growing up?\n\nI am from Orogwe in Owerri-West, Imo State. I grew up from home, then at Federal Housing Estate in Owerri town. Growing up was quite amazing because of our close-knit family. I have my parents and siblings very much together. I don\u2019t think I can ever choose another family above mine.\n\nWhat about the fond memories of growing up?\n\nI miss playing with my siblings, my father telling us about the clan in our community which gives me headache at times. My mum\u2019s stories under the moonlight. It was amazing growing up. I also have a lot of people who mock me by calling me \u2018orobo\u2019 which means a fat girl. Such words reduce my self esteem, but my mother would always tell me, don\u2019t mind them, you have big bones and all that. No child likes such self-demeaning thoughts. There would always be stuffs like no man would like to marry a huge girl, these are pressures that are uncalled for. We plus-sized ladies go through a lot in terms of interactions and approach.\n\nDid body-shaming reduce you emotionally? Were you ashamed of yourself?\n\nUp till primary school, my mother made sure she demystified all that. She told me, when she gave birth to me, baby clothes meant for me did not size me, they quickly ran to the market to buy one-year old baby dress for me. She kept reminding me that I have always been big. That this is who I am. She would align healthy foods for me and always there to console me. Even in my house, I was at times being body-shamed. I can understand from their point of view that they do not want me to grow out of proportion; I felt out with my dad countless times. One of the days, we have gathered at the dining table to eat and he asked me \u2018are you still eating\u201d I was angry, lost my appetite instantly, dropped my cutleries and walked away. He said that I was supposed to register at the Gym, which I did. Luckily for me, I am a healthy child, but they do not know how hard I try on my own to lose weight. There is no young girl who would not like to wear lovely clothes like her mates do. The least anybody can do is to encourage, accommodate, admit and love yourself. I actually went into this competition because of my dad. He does not support this type of movement; but then, I did not want him to hear from the outside, So I told him and he did not like it. From my childhood, I had wanted to be a queen, that big girl out there. I wanted my voice to be heard in a positive way with my plus-size body. I remember when I represented my school at HoT FM; my dad was the one receiving the calls, \u201cYour daughter is at Hot FM, tune in and listen to her. He was the same person smiling and receiving all the congratulations, saying yes, that is my daughter. At the end of the pageant, my father who never supported it, was the one who sat in the audience to cheer me up. When I got my crown, he was the first to hug me.\n\nWhat are your plans because marriage is also knocking at the door?\n\nThat part will also shock people because the common language is nobody seeks the hand of plus-size ladies in marriage. They will be shocked that plus-size ladies are some men\u2019s spec. I want to let other plus-sized ladies love themselves, wear that cropped top other slimmer girl\u2019s wear.\n\nWhat advice do you have for plus-size girls?\n\nEvery big girl should fight and take hygiene seriously; keep her body neat for big girls have tendency to smell because there are areas that might not get air into them fast. It\u2019s because most of the fat girls do not scrub themselves well that most people say all manner of things about them. Just be conscious of your hygiene so people will respect you. That was another area my mother fought hard, to make sure I did not have body odour; if my siblings bathe twice, I would be forced to bathe four times in a day, but she would say, I am not trying to hurt you, but you will appreciate this later in life, and that I am doing. My mum brought me up differently because I am a plus-size.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "From Ogbonnaya Ndukwe, Aba\n\nIchie Chuks Muoma, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) is the chairman of Igbo Lawyers Association (ILA) based in Aba, Abia State. He said that Nigerian politicians do not work with ideas to propel national growth and development of the people.\n\nThe immediate past legal adviser of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, said that South Easterners in other parts of the country and abroad should come home to invest in the zone to boost the regional economy, as he called for true federalism and return to the 1963 Constitution, to check the political imbalance affecting the unity of the country.\n\nHe also spoke on the recent rendition of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu; a British citizen, from Kenya to Nigeria, describing it as an international brigandage and terrorism on the part of Nigeria and its cohorts.\n\nLooking at Nigeria today, would you say it was the country Nigerians dreamt of at independence in 1960?\n\nNigeria as it is today was not the one we dreamt to have in 1960. Certainly not the one we welcomed on October 1, 1960. The problems are complex with several things going wrong. Our politicians do not measure up to international standards. Greed and materialism are the quest for holding public and political offices in Nigeria. Our politicians do not have any agenda or manifesto, except self and material interest to become billionaires and trillionaires overnight. That\u2019s Nigerian politics. There\u2019s no ideology propelling the life of Nigeria. It is all self-interest and to make it worse, ethnicity and the ambition of the ethnic groups in rivalry, to control the country and her resources. Those who produce by working so hard and offering their resources are hungry while those who do not produce sufficiently are very, very well fed, and well looked after. So, there is societal imbalance. Nigeria is a country where mere hard work will not put food on one\u2019s table.\n\nIs this the reason political contests in the country are seen as war?\n\nYes, more like it. One has to go into public office to steal public money, to embezzle public money and this is why our politicians are always desperate in seeking for offices. They are prepared to commit all manner of atrocities, including shedding blood, to win election and enter into positions where others will work very hard to bring in the money and they themselves, will do the looting. By age, I am qualified to talk about Nigeria. Intellectually, I am qualified to talk about Nigeria and socially I am also qualified. There\u2019s no altruism, no selflessness in sacrifice. Everyone serves to enrich himself, his family, associates and partners in the crime of embezzling the treasury.\n\nHow did we get to this point and what do you think should be done?\n\nThat\u2019s a question no one can answer easily, but somehow, I can make a trial. We reached here through corruption, dishonesty and insincerity in public service. That\u2019s how we reached here. Well, I will tell you one story I like telling people when talking about Nigeria. When God created the African countries, he gave Nigeria everything, all resources, but denied it good leadership at the centre. Nigeria is ruined or was ruined by its bad leadership. We are now witnesses of the type of leadership Nigeria has, despite having all the human and mineral resources at its disposal. How do we find a solution to the problem? It is a task for you and I and every other person.\n\nThere are arguments on what is responsible for the marginalization of the Southeast and leading to agitation for secession. What is your take on this and how do we solve the problem?\n\nI believe that the current problems facing the Southeast, are being perpetrated and fanned by some people from outside Igbo land. I also believe governance in the Southeast is poor and selfish, though they are not different from what we see in other parts of the country. We are ruled by people who are suffering from poverty consciousness. Our leaders, Igbo leaders, are suffering from poverty consciousness. Permit me, to define what I mean by poverty consciousness. It is the fear of the poor to remain poor and the fear of rich to become poor. Both the rich and the poor are equally afraid of poverty. Poverty is a situation that leads to desperation. Everyone wants to be rich and nobody wants to experience any factor that will prevent him from being a rich man. In Nigeria, we suffer from spiritual poverty. We have a very low spiritual consciousness, never mind the saturation of spiritual houses. The problems came along after the civil war. Our leadership before the civil war, was correct, selfless, and focused on positive orientation. All our leaders \u2013 Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Chief Obafemi Awolowo, did not amass wealth. They were focused on making Nigeria great. We attained the giant of Africa stance during their time. The madness for materialism started after the civil war.\n\nYou were in politics in the 2nd R1epublic?\n\nYes, as a young lawyer, I was a politician, from the NPP, GNPP and NRC. At a stage, I told myself that I wouldn\u2019t be part of the mess anymore. I pulled out from politics in 1990/1991, to focus on my legal practice and swore not to do anything with politics as I found the system too corrupt for my liking. I don\u2019t do things because of money. Service comes before wealth for me. A reward must be the outcome of hard work.\n\nDo you think that the agitation to have the presidency zoned to the Southeast come 2023, will assuage the feelings of marginalization and ill-treatment of Ndigbo in Nigeria, as being claimed in some quarters?\n\nThat\u2019s a very good question. My preference is restructuring. Like we were until the civil war, the 1963 Constitution was the best for Nigeria. It encouraged positive efforts in self-development. We had autonomous regions. Those Constitutions 1960/1963, focused on true federalism, physically and politically. But it seems that the civil war and subsequent events, constituted an advantage now being exploited by only a section of the country. The benefit is not federal. It is sectional. So, here we are. We have to go back to the 1963 Constitution, so that the regions will go back to what they were. They had healthy competition in development and made contributions to the Federal Government to take care of national institutions like foreign affairs, currency, the defence and others. You can see true federalism in other parts of the world. What we have in Nigeria is a masquerade in the name of federalism. Inside, it is centralism, dictatorship and oppression. The system doesn\u2019t encourage individual or regional enterprise.\n\nAs Chairman of Igbo Lawyers Association (ILA) in Aba, you have been calling on the federal authorities to release IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Why the strident call?\n\nYes, I have good reasons to do so and on point of law, kidnapping and abduction can never be legal whether nationally, internationally or regionally. They are crimes whether perpetuated in the village, town, community, state or international platforms. It remains a crime, no matter the coloration one gives it. Nnamdi Kanu travelled to Kenya from the United Kingdom with a British passport. As a British citizen, it is an international crime, brigandage and terrorism, for him to be abducted in Kenya, tortured and brought back by force to Nigeria. It doesn\u2019t matter the coloration they give it, it is an act of international brigandage and terrorism.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s cause alongside that of Sunday Igboho in the Southwest. Are Igbo leaders doing enough to get him out like the Yoruba are doing for Igboho?\n\nYou see, it is legal under international law to agitate for self-determination. There have been successful agitations in various parts of the world. Indonesia and East Timor had a referendum for the later to become independent. It is provided for in international law. South Sudan also, so, what is the crime of someone saying he is not comfortable where he is? We are not comfortable. Give us the option to say whether to remain with you, or go and you call the person a terrorist. Referendum was conducted in Scotland. It was also done in Spain (Catalonia), and Quebec in Canada. Some succeed while others do not, and no one is killed, abducted, slaughtered and incarcerated for agitating for self-determination in a democracy. It was a plebiscite/referendum that brought Adamawa into Nigeria from Northern Cameroun. It was not fighter jets or AK 47.\n\nI mean sir, Igbo leaders are not speaking in Kanu\u2019s favour, why?\n\nI will tell you why. It is true and the reason is that Igbo leaders are double-headed. They are members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the morning (daytime) and All Progressives Congress (APC) at night. I have said this before and nobody has challenged me on that. Our governors and leaders in the PDP are APC in the night. All of them crawl to Abuja in the night in quest for materialism and superlative wealth. They don\u2019t have the spirit of selfless leadership. We are praying that Kanu gets a fair trial, but I cannot read the mind of any judge in such matters. Even the devil cannot read any man\u2019s mind.\n\nWhat\u2019s your advice to the Igbo in Diaspora including the clamour for president from Southeast in 2023?\n\nI am skeptical about the Southeast getting the presidency in 2023. Any Igbo man elected president of Nigeria without the country being restructured will not last. The security apparatus that will protect the centre are currently in the hands of a section of the country. They have to be decentralized first, with a new Constitution in place to realize a peaceful nation. To our businessmen outside the Southeast, they should come home and invest to develop our land. I stand for restructuring. It will give each region the platform to grow at its pace and contribute to the centre and it is only through dialogue and not use of force, that Nigeria will succeed.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nTwo children who were among the 28 people that were abducted by bandits in Katoge village in Batsari Local Government Area of Katsina State have reportedly died of starvation while in captivity.\n\nThe victims were kidnapped in their ancestral home (Katoge) in April, 2021 and taken to a forest in Zamfara State by their abductors.\n\nOne of the victims, Mrs Sahura Haruna, who regained freedom after spending five months in bandits\u2019 enclaves, told journalists in Katsina that the children died as a result of starvation.\n\nShe explained that six out of the 28 abducted victims were earlier released by the hoodlums after payment of ransom by their relatives, adding that the bandits abducted her when she was five months pregnant.\n\nSahura, who gave birth to a baby girl while in captivity, was among 20 captives that escaped from the bandits\u2019 den in Zamfara forest last Thursday following the ongoing onslaught against the marauding hooligans by security operatives.\n\nShe said: \u201cLast April, some bandits abducted 28 of us in Katoge village. They released six after payment of ransom by their relatives. Two children who were among us died of hunger and severe punishment by the bandits, leaving 20 of us with them (bandits).\n\n\u201cSo, last Thursday, we were sitting with a few of the bandits who were guarding us when we heard an aircraft roving the forest and the bandits started running and that paved the way for us to escape.\n\n\u201cWe ran until we arrived at a village in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of Zamfara State where we met some security personnel who took us to Gusau town and handed us over to government officials\u201d.\n\nAccording to her, they were subjected to different kind of assaults and starvation in the hands of the bandits because their relatives failed to pay the ransom demanded.\n\nReceiving the 20 escapees in Katsina, Saturday evening, the Secretary to the State Government, Dr. Mustapha Inuwa, said they regained freedom due to the current war against their abductors and stringent security containment measures adopted by the Katsina and Zamfara state governments.\n\nHe advised the federal government and security agencies to extend similar ongoing operations in Zamfara forest to adjoining forests in Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto and other states in order to completely ward off the criminals.\n\nThe secretary to the state government, however, directed the Permanent Secretary, Cabinet and Security, to provide financial support to the rescued kidnapped victims, and the state emergency management agency (SEMA) to give them food items to cushion their hardships.\n\nThe freed captives include 10 women, eight girls, one boy and a middle-aged man and they have since been reunited with their families after medical examination by the state government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Former vice president, Oyo gov back Jegede in chairmanship race\n\n\u2022Rivers gov throws weight behind Orbih\n\n\u2022Former govs, ex-ministers back Oyinlola\n\n\u2022PDP govs tackle Umahi over zoning of presidential ticket\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Rivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike, and the Governor of Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, are set to clash in a battle for the control of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the race for the chairmanship of the main opposition party gets tougher, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that before the alliance between Makinde and Wike collapsed, the two governors were backing the former governor of Osun State, Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola (rtd) as the next national chairman of the party.\n\nInvestigation however revealed that Wike has now thrown his weight behind the Deputy Vice Chairman of the party in the South-south, Mr. Dan Orbih, while Atiku and Makinde are behind the chairmanship aspiration of the former governorship candidate of the party in Ondo State, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede (SAN).\n\nOn the other hand, former governors and ex-ministers in the main opposition party have thrown their weight behind Oyinlola, ahead of next month\u2019s National Convention of the party.\n\nThis is coming as the governors elected on the platform of the PDP have called on the Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. Dave Umahi, to face his frustrations and the misrule of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and bother less on how the PDP would zone the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nA source privy to the PDP power game told THISDAY that the Rivers State governor withdrew his support for Oyinlola because he would not want a national chairman who will be \u201ctaking instructions from Ota (referring to former President Olusegun Obasanjo) and Minna (referring to former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd)).\u201d\n\n\u201cMakinde later learnt that his Rivers State counterpart was no longer on the same page with him, as he was supporting Dan Orbih against their earlier plan of installing Oyinlola. After a meeting with the former vice president, Makinde shifted his support to Jegede,\u201d the source explained.\n\nThe intrigues on who becomes the national chairman have continued as former governors of PDP and ex-ministers are said to have backed Oyinlola.\n\nThe former governors and ex-ministers were said to have insisted that the next national chairman of the party should not emerge from a PDP-controlled state to avoid the fate suffered by the embattled National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in the hands of Wike.\n\nThe former governors are said to be strongly supporting Oyinlola because his state, Osun, is currently governed by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAs the committee of the PDP for zoning of offices in the National Working Committee (NWC) begins sitting, new calculations have emerged for the zoning of the office of the leadership of the party.\n\nIt was reliably gathered that the position of the national chairman would be zoned to the entire South or North, instead of micro zoning it to a particular zone or state.\n\nIt was learnt that the 44-member zoning committee led by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State which commenced sitting yesterday, is faced with the difficult choice of whether the chairman of the party should come from North or South, a decision that will also have implications on where the next presidential candidate of the party for the 2023 election will come from.\n\nA top PDP source told THISDAY that the committee headed by Ugwuanyi has decided to be fair to any of the national chairmanship aspirants from the South by ensuring that the office is open to all.\n\nAccording to the source, this is to avoid any litigation against anyone claiming that his or her constitutional right has been abridged.\n\n\u201cIt has been decided that the office of the national chairman would be thrown open and by so doing, all interested persons from the South are free to contest.\n\n\u201cThis is mainly for the national chairmanship position. But we intend to be slightly different in approach for other offices of the NWC,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source added that the offices of the two deputy chairmen for the South and North would not be micro-zoned to states, but to the zones that had earlier produced them in the pre-2017 national convention.\n\nHowever, it is expected that the entire work of Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s committee would be subject to the final ratification of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, leaders of PDP in the six states in the South-west have sent a strong message to the leadership of the party on the need to zone the post of national chairman to the zone in the forthcoming national convention.\n\nThe South-west PDP leaders believe the chairmanship should be specifically zoned to the South-west to compensate for the 2017 situation in which it was unjustly denied the slot after the post had been zoned to it.\n\nThey also argued that the denial of the zone of the post of chairman in 2017 led to the dwindling fortunes of the party in the zone.\n\nThe South-west PDP leaders noted that the zone has two governorship polls pending in Ekiti and Osun states before the 2023 general election, insisting that having the national chairmanship slot would help seal victory in two states, thereby boosting the chances of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nPDP Govs Tackle Umahi over Party\u2019s Presidential Ticket\n\nMeanwhile, the governors elected on the platform of the PDP have called on the Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. Dave Umahi, to face his frustration and the misrule of his party, the APC, and bother less on how the PDP would zone the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nThe governors expressed outrage over what they described as an attempt by Umahi, who illegally and immorally sits on a PDP mandate and calls himself an APC governor, to turn the truth on its head.\n\nUmahi had on Friday mocked the governors of the PDP in the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum who joined in adopting the resolution for power shift to the South, saying their body language shows the PDP won\u2019t zone the presidency to the South.\n\nUmahi, who spoke on a live TV programme, alleged that the PDP governors at the meeting in Enugu were being dishonest with their claim that they are keen about the 2023 presidency going to the South.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Director General of the PDP Governors Forum, Hon. Cyril Maduabum, \u201cGovernor Umahi left PDP for APC, according to him, because of the love he has for President Buhari, among other flimsy reasons, irrespective of the maladministration and daily incidents of destruction of lives and properties currently going on in Ebonyi State and the entire country under the watch of APC.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi sabotaged the PDP in 2019 elections in his quest to deliver 25 per cent to his APC benefactors. It took the determined resistance of Ebonyi State people to checkmate him. It was good riddance that he subsequently left PDP for APC instead of continuing his role as an APC mole,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn the issue of zoning, the PDP governors said, \u201cwe advise Governor Umahi to face his frustrations in APC and not drag PDP and her governors into it. PDP is an independent political party with workable structures and methods of doing things. It\u2019s not an appendage of the APC or indeed any other association or group.\u201d\n\nThe PDP governors said that the party would take its decision on the issue of zoning political offices at the appropriate time, stating that, \u201ceven the APC has not taken any decision yet on zoning.\n\n\u201cDifferent groups and interests are advancing arguments to defend their positions as is required in a democracy. At the end of the day, decisions will be taken by each political party,\u201d the PDP governors said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Virologist insists on release of N10bn fund\n\n\u2022Locally-made vaccines feasible in next 18 months, says PSN\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nA professor of Virology, Professor Oyewale Tomori; the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), and the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) have given conditions for Nigeria to start the local production of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s impressive rating in its response to the pandemic, it appears not to be making progress on the issue of the production of vaccines.\n\nIn their separate interviews with THISDAY, Tomori, NMA, and PSN explained the challenges hindering Nigeria\u2019s efforts to manufacture the vaccines locally.\n\nWhile the PSN said the local production of the vaccines is feasible in the next 18 months, the Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, said the agency was working to attain WHO\u2019s Level 3 maturity, which will qualify it to supervise local manufacturers.\n\nShe, however, promised that safe and efficacious vaccines would be manufactured in Nigeria in no distant future.\n\nBut Tomori, who is the Chairman of the board of the Bio-Vaccine Nigerian Limited, said the country\u2019s efforts to manufacture the vaccines were being hindered by conflicting decisions and pronouncements by government officials.\n\nTomori told THISDAY that the Executive Arm and the National Assembly appeared not to be on the same page as far as plans for the actualisation of the noble initiative are concerned.\n\nTomori said that the N10 billion budget approved since 2020 to secure the take-off of the vaccine manufacturing company has not been released.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we have not been serious as a nation regarding the issue of vaccine manufacturing. We have had a budget of N10 billion since last year but nothing has been released. So, when you said that Nigeria is at the forefront of countries bidding for the deal to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines, that is not true; we are not in the forefront, we are on the back burner.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare Nigeria with those countries which are acting, we are mere talkers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe virologist lamented that Nigeria is not where it should be on the issue of vaccine production considering the enormous human and material resources the country possesses.\n\nAccording to Tomori, many of the factors that are delaying the local manufacturing of vaccines in the country are man-made.\n\n\u201cWe are reaping the benefits of our lack of seriousness and neglect. That is why we are still talking about vaccine donation; that is why we have not been able to secure a deal to manufacture vaccines locally\u201d, he added.\n\nTomori argued that country\u2019s inability to focus on long-term goals and work genuinely towards achieving such goals without attaching personal or parochial interests has robbed the country of the opportunity to secure a deal to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines ahead of other African countries.\n\n\u201cThe challenges are many and multifaceted. They include inconsistent government policies that make it impossible to set and meet long-term goals and objectives, overriding national interest by personal interests that ensure that Nigeria continues to import vaccines through translucent (semi-transparent) procurement processes.\n\n\u201cOthers are time-bomb obstacles placed in the way of doing business where getting approvals becomes difficult and forever obstacles/steeplechase race, dealing with pretenders, who loudly proclaim and carry the banner and flag of accountability and transparency, but gunning to milk the country dry using you as the conduit pipe to drain the national resources into their filthy and leaking pockets\u201d.\n\nTomori also bemoaned what he described as the government\u2019s prolonged dependence on donations as a major source of acquiring COVID-19 vaccines to tackle the ravaging health emergency.\n\nHe said that such dependence has not enabled Nigeria to meet up with COVID-19 vaccine requirements for her teeming population in need of protection from the deadly virus.\n\n\u201cThere was a budget of N296 billion set aside since last year for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine. Since then, how many doses have been bought except for the recent purchase of 177,600 doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine from the United States?\n\nSome serious countries had even before the production of the vaccines started paying for it.\n\n\u201cIt is not by word of the mouth that I am going to buy the vaccine, the question is did you pay for the vaccine?\u201d he added.\n\nTomori however said that as individuals who love the country, patriotic Nigerians must never relent in their efforts but continue to fight for the development of the country.\n\nOn his part, the President of the NMA and a former Director-General of Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Prof. Innocent Ujah, said that for the country to manufacture the COVID-19 vaccines locally, the federal government should establish a partnership with a foreign company to facilitate the manufacture of these vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cThis requires a partnership between government and the private sector entities to sign Memorandum of Understanding. What they need is to get this MoU done because it is going to be driven by the private sector but the government has to create the enabling environment; they have to make it conducive for the company to start production,\u201d he said.\n\nUjah, however, said that the country presently lacks such a conducive environment to quicken the establishment of a vaccine manufacturing facility.\n\nFor instance, he disclosed that there is no hospital or health facility with the equipment that can conduct clinical trials in the country.\n\nUjah said that although the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in Lagos has started building hospital wards for clinical trials, the government needs to activate the national centre for research and innovation to drive the process.\n\nAccording to the NMA president, what was lacking is the right commitment to getting things done.\n\n\u201cI know Nigerians are very resilient and resourceful people; all that is needed is a firm commitment by the government and the private sector and we will achieve results,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the President of PSN, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa told THISDAY that two critical stakeholders in the vaccine manufacturing venture \u2013 NAFDAC and private sector firms were still in the process of setting up the needed facilities for the project.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, one or two companies are trying to set up plants for the manufacture of vaccines in the country but they are just at the preliminary stages.\n\n\u201cSome of them just got some facility from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and they are trying to acquire equipment because vaccine manufacturing requires the highest level of GNP compliance.\n\n\u201cEven the regulatory agency, NAFDAC is currently struggling to get qualified to be able to regulate and inspect vaccine manufacturing process. So, while the regulator is trying to get itself ready to be able to regulate, the companies are still in the process of setting up plant\u201d.\n\nOhuabunwa said that there is presently a high appetite for local manufacturing, adding, however, that getting to the stage of actual manufacturing in the country won\u2019t be possible until at least, the next 18 months.\n\nHe, however, said that the delay in actualising the dream was due to a lack of requisite facilities and qualified regulators.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, it is important that NAFDAC secures the certification it needs to be able to regulate the vaccine sector because if companies set up their plants first, they may be required to make further adjustments that may condemn the equipment due to poor standards\u201d.\n\nOhuabunwa said that some international vaccine manufacturing firms have shown interest in licensing vaccine manufacturing in Nigeria so long as the required facilities are ready.\n\nNAFDAC Working to Attain WHO\u2019s Level 3 Maturity, Says Agency\n\nOn her part, the Director General of NAFDAC, Adeyeye, who spoke through the Resident Consultant of the agency, Sayo Akintola, said NAFDAC was working to attain WHO\u2019s Level 3 maturity to be able to regulate the local manufacturers.\n\nAdeyeye said Nigeria was assessed in July 2019 with a couple of follow-up assessments in a bid to ensure that the country attains the WHO maturity level 3.\n\nThe WHO Global Benchmarking exercise is a regulatory system strengthening effort used to assess the national regulatory systems of medicine regulatory authorities in the world.\n\nAdeyeye said that the assessment would position the country, especially NAFDAC, to be better equipped to regulate the prospective vaccine manufacturers.\n\nAccording to her, it would also give the local manufacturers the opportunity of being WHO pre-qualified, which means potentials to participate in international bids.\n\n\u201cThere has been a global challenge in the supply of COVID 19 vaccines. Countries, where these vaccines are manufactured, are ensuring that their populace gets access to this scarce essential health commodity before they are allowed for exports. This has necessitated the need for Nigeria to sustain efforts in supporting the local capacity for COVID-19 vaccine production. NAFDAC being the national medicine regulatory authority in Nigeria is poised to give the required guidance in terms of capacity building. There have been several stakeholder engagements with prospective applicants in this regard. It is hoped that in no distant future, quality, safe and efficacious vaccines would be manufactured in Nigeria,\u201d she explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Datong, who was abducted by armed bandits in Kaduna.\n\nDatong was abducted on August 24 from the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna.\n\nThe six planes are designed for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance missions.\n\nThe first batch of the attack aircraft had earlier been delivered by the US and have since been inducted into the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) order of battle by President Muhammadu Buhari and United States government officials at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the military planes are unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and have opted for a North Atlantic route, hopping to multiple spots to refuel with Worcester being one of the places to stop over and refuel.\n\nThe initial six delivered by the US flew through five countries, including Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Spain, and Algeria before arriving at their final destination in Nigeria towards the end of July.\n\nThe planes refueled at Rectrix in the Worcester Regional Airport in the United States.\n\nThe A-29 Super Tucano, designed by the Sierra Nevada Corporation in Sparks, Nevada, are light attack aircraft to be deployed by the NAF in the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nWorcester Telegram reported that the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, a Worcester native, was in town for her high school reunion at Doherty Memorial High School.\n\nLeonard decided to visit the pilots Thursday and see them off.\n\nThe planes were reportedly parked near the spot of the little hangar that Leonard\u2019s father used to park his plane as a member of a pilot club in the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I stood here before a very long time ago and now there are these planes that are related to my work in Nigeria,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nThe planes are a part of the United States\u2019 security partnership with the Nigerian government.\n\nThey are expected to land in Nigeria on or around September 24.\n\nIt would be recalled that the first batch of A-29 Super Tucano aircraft arrived in Kano on July 22.\n\nThe planes were received by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd); Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Faruk Yahaya and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao.\n\nThe first batch of fighter jets departed the United States on July 14, 2021.\n\nNAF had also completed the construction of a hangar in Jaji, Kaduna State, where the attack aircraft would be domiciled.\n\nSpeaking at a joint media briefing in Abuja to herald the induction of the first batch of the planes, the United States Envoy to Nigeria, Leonard, and the Commander of the US Air Forces in Europe and Africa, Gen Jeffrey Harrigian, said the A-29 Super Tucano sale was the largest foreign military sale in Sub-saharan Africa.\n\nNigeria also has the largest International Military-Education and Training Sale in the sub-Saharan Training (IMET) programme in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the Super Tucano aircraft, General Harrigian said the delivery of the fighter planes was an opportunity for the US Air Force and Nigerian Air Force \u201cto recommit ourselves and contribute to Nigeria\u2019s stability. It brings about capabilities.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity to work together in challenging times. The A -29 Super Tucano allows us to reconnect our relationship with Nigeria\u201d, he said, while noting that the partnership would focus on intelligence sharing, maintenance, tactics, planning, contribution to skills set and other areas outside the military\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, the Commander, US Air Forces in Europe and Africa, Gen Jeff Harrigian, had stated that \u201cNigerian Air Force is one of our key partners that play a critical role in furthering regional security and stability.\n\n\u201cThis ceremony symbolises the strength of our unique partnership and underscores the value of training and working together. The Super Tucanos were the impetus for the significant deepening of training and professional relationships\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said precision targeting, air-to-ground integration, and human rights training are all included in the partnership between the U.S. and Nigeria.\n\nTroops Rescue Major Datong Abducted from NDA\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Army said yesterday that troops rescued a military officer, Major C.L. Datong, who was abducted by armed bandits in Kaduna, after a fierce exchange of gunfire.\n\nThe bandits, who breached the security of the NDA on August 24, opened fire on them, killing two officers.\n\nA statement issued by the Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, 1 Division of the Nigerian Army, Col. Ezindu Idiama, said following the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Lucky Irabor, and service chiefs to 1 Division Nigerian Army to rescue the officer, the division, in conjunction with the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and all security agencies, conducted decisive operations to rescue Major CL Datong, who was abducted at Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Permanent Site on August 24, 2021.\n\nIt said the military high command had directed that the perpetrators be found dead or alive.\n\n\u201cThe Division, in conjunction with the Air Task Force, Department of State Services, and other security agencies, immediately swung into action by conducting operations in the Afaka general area to find and rescue the officer.\n\n\u201cThe operations were being conducted based on several leads received from various sources regarding the abductors and likely locations the officer was being held,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe operations which were sustained since the abduction of the officer proved quite successful and led to the destruction of several identified bandits\u2019 camps in the Afaka-Birnin Gwari general area and neutralisation of scores of bandits particularly, in the late hours of today, 17 September 2021, the troops arrived at a camp suspected to be the location where Maj C.L. Datong was being held.\n\n\u201cAt the camp, the troops exchanged fire with the bandits. In the process, the gallant troops were able to rescue the abducted officer. However, the officer sustained a minor injury but has been treated in a medical facility and handed over to NDA for further action\u201d.\n\nThe division commended security agencies for their support.\n\n\u201cThe Division wishes to commend the efforts of the NAF, DSS, Nigerian Police, and patriotic Nigerians for their invaluable support which contributed to the success of this operation.\n\n\u201cOur operations will continue until we capture or neutralise the assailants that killed two officers in the NDA on August 24, 2021\u201d, the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has reportedly called police officers in London to prevent Nigerian protesters from gathering in front of the Nigeria House at Trafalgar Square in London, United Kingdom.\n\nIn a video obtained by SaharaReporters, some peaceful protesters who were demanding Buhari's return to Nigeria were on Thursday evening challenged by the British police.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nBuhari is in London for medical treatment.\n\nAfter attending the Global Education Summit on Financing Global Partnership for Education (GPE) 2021-2025, the Nigerian President stayed behind to see his doctors, even as resident doctors in his country have gone on strike.\n\nThe police officers were seen speaking with the Nigerian protesters, seemingly persuading them to stop protesting there.\n\nAlso, more officers were seen arriving in police vans while a Nigerian woman was heard screaming without fear, the demands of the protesters which included the President returning to Nigeria and putting an end to the killings in the West African country.\n\nA police officer was heard saying, \u201cThe cameras are on. Someone was sticking out last night, you just got lucky,\u201d and when he was asked if he upholds the law, he replied, \u201cI am without fear or favour\".\n\nOne of the female protesters said, \u201cThey are killing in our country, they are killing our people, Buhari is here with Boris Johnson and I am surprised that Prime Minister will condone such, condoning corruption and murder, it is terrible.\n\n\u201dThey are killing in our country. Let him just go and resign, enough of the killings in Nigeria, where is that done and he has the audacity to come to this country for healthcare. He keeps embezzling our money and killing people, that's our story. Muhammadu Buhari, the President of Nigeria is a terrorist and we will not back down, we are not violating the law, it is our civic right and we will exercise it.\n\n\u201dBuhari is a murderer. There is no single healthcare in Nigeria, Buhari is still in government for over 6 years, he keeps borrowing, the economy is not good, there is rising inflation. Our Naira has no value. They are kidnapping children and killing people.\u201d\n\nA male protester said, \u201cThere's a criminal called Buhari here and what we'd like to do is get him back to the place where he has come from.\u201d\n\nUpon sighting an officer, he said, \u201cThat's a big gun. I didn't put him on the door. I'm surprised you are back. Even more (police officers) are coming, wow! this is serious.\"\n\nAfter the police left, a male protester said, \u201cDay 8 of Buhari Watch, we are here in front of Nigerian House here in Central London, Trafalgar Square, where our president is still missing, yes the police have come and they have gone, they know that we are not doing anything illegal, this is the right of the citizens to protest, they were here to protect us. Yes, the police were here to protect us.\n\n\u201cBuhari, your administration has been the worst in the history of Nigeria, that is the only award we can give you and your administration will not get away with the crime you have committed in office. The innocent blood you are shedding daily will continue to cry for justice.\n\n\u201cBuhari, you are a total disgrace. Leave office now, no one wants you to continue, the people you have with you are living for themselves, they will also be judged, they will turn their backs on you, they will not honour a thief, no one is on your side, you are a kidnapper, a terrorist.\n\n\"You are hiding in London, if you are not, where are you?

Someone was sticking out last night, you just got lucky,\u201d and when he was asked if he upholds the law, he replied, \u201cI am without fear or favour\".\n\nOne of the female protesters said, \u201cThey are killing in our country, they are killing our people, Buhari is here with Boris Johnson and I am surprised that Prime Minister will condone such, condoning corruption and murder, it is terrible.\n\n\u201dThey are killing in our country. Let him just go and resign, enough of the killings in Nigeria, where is that done and he has the audacity to come to this country for healthcare. He keeps embezzling our money and killing people, that's our story. Muhammadu Buhari, the President of Nigeria is a terrorist and we will not back down, we are not violating the law, it is our civic right and we will exercise it.\n\n\u201dBuhari is a murderer. There is no single healthcare in Nigeria, Buhari is still in government for over 6 years, he keeps borrowing, the economy is not good, there is rising inflation. Our Naira has no value. They are kidnapping children and killing people.\u201d\n\nA male protester said, \u201cThere's a criminal called Buhari here and what we'd like to do is get him back to the place where he has come from.\u201d\n\nUpon sighting an officer, he said, \u201cThat's a big gun. I didn't put him on the door. I'm surprised you are back. Even more (police officers) are coming, wow! this is serious.\"\n\nAfter the police left, a male protester said, \u201cDay 8 of Buhari Watch, we are here in front of Nigerian House here in Central London, Trafalgar Square, where our president is still missing, yes the police have come and they have gone, they know that we are not doing anything illegal, this is the right of the citizens to protest, they were here to protect us. Yes, the police were here to protect us.\n\n\u201cBuhari, your administration has been the worst in the history of Nigeria, that is the only award we can give you and your administration will not get away with the crime you have committed in office. The innocent blood you are shedding daily will continue to cry for justice.\n\n\u201cBuhari, you are a total disgrace. Leave office now, no one wants you to continue, the people you have with you are living for themselves, they will also be judged, they will turn their backs on you, they will not honour a thief, no one is on your side, you are a kidnapper, a terrorist.\n\n\"You are hiding in London, if you are not, where are you? Buhari, you are a wicked President, leave the government now, release Sowore, over two years now. Release Nnamdi Kanu. Release Sunday Igboho now! Release all political prisoners now!

          "text": "Human rights\u2019 activist and Amnesty International-designated Prisoner of Conscience, Omoyele Sowore, has urged all Nigerians to join the planned nationwide protest on October 1 \u2013 Independence Day \u2013 in Nigeria.\n\nThe Coalition for Revolution (CORE), the organisers of the #RevolutionNow protest, had announced plans to hold a mass action against poor governance in Nigeria on October 1.\n\nOmoyele Sowore\n\nThe protest is necessitated by nine demands, according to a statement by CORE\u2019s co-convener, Baba Aye, and co-convener, Gbenga Komolafe.\n\nAmong their demands is the recognition of those who died during the #EndSARS protests as national heroes, with a national apology.\n\nThey complained that the Muhammadu Buhari-led government took \u201cthe incompetence, corruption, and repressive tendencies of the country\u2019s ruling class to the height of infamy.\u201d\n\nThey also lamented that tens of thousands of workers had been sacked while many more had suffered salary cuts.\n\n\u201cFarmers cannot access seedlings and other agricultural inputs. Traders and other informal economy workers have no access to credit.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s public health and education facilities are in terrible states. Doctors are on strike; other health workers are warming up for a strike. And university teachers are also likely to go on strike soon. All these are because the regime refuses to respect collective agreements reached with their unions.\n\n\u201cEven our very lives are now in jeopardy. Physical insecurity has also become the order of the day. More than 4,000 people have been killed and at least 3,100 kidnapped this year alone. Several families have become bankrupt as they sold all they had to pay kidnappers,\u201d they complained.\n\nSowore in a Facebook post on Saturday also lent his voice to the October 1 protest.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are sorry. We are not doing Independence Day this year due to tyranny, oppression, corruption, nepotism, return of SARS, terrorism, killing of Shiites, extra judicial killings of #IPOB members, non-payment of salaries and wages, insecurity, high school fees, high food prices, spike in electricity tariffs, social media bills, hate speech bills, detention of dissenting voices, discrimination against minorities, pollution of Niger Delta environment, medical tourism by Nigerian rulers, bad roads, no electricity, lack of funding for education, high perks for useless lawmakers and ministers, killing of our soldiers due to embezzlement of monies meant for fighting equipment, oppression by landlords against tenants, police brutality, terrible foreign policies that lets Ghana and South Africa oppress our people, incompetence at all levels by the Muhammadu Buhari regime, round tripping of dollars, suppression of self-determination activists, disobedience of court orders by lawless DSS, kidnapping of school children, rewarding banditry, currency manipulation by the CBN Governor, rigging of elections by INEC and State SIECs, Twitter ban, harassment of small business owners, crypto ban, illegal raids and arrests, illegal and corrupt acquisition of killer foreign loans, killing of corruption cases for political gains, serious bribery and corruption, encouragement of crippling worker\u2019s strikes, Etc #endsars #revolution #arevolutionnow #Buharimustgo #occupynigeria2 #RevolutionNow.\u201d\n\nIndependence Day is an official national holiday in Nigeria, celebrated on the first of October.\n\nIt marks Nigeria's proclamation of independence from British rule on 1 October 1960.",

          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "Africell exits Ugandan telecom market due to fierce competition",
          "text": "On September 7, Africell announced its decision to leave Uganda after operating in the East African country for seven years. The decision saw the U.S-owned company become the latest network operator to throw in the towel and exit a market dominated by two pan-African telecom behemoths.\n\nA statement issued by Africell blames tough competition from the local units of MTN and Bharti Airtel, both of which account for more than 90% of the market share. The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s curious case of rising debt profile amid worsening poverty",
          "text": "Since 2015 when the Muhammadu Buhari administration came to power, Nigeria\u2019s debt stock has been on the upward trajectory. Within this period, however, Nigeria has won the unenviable trophy as the world poverty capital. Every index of human development has been negative for the country.\n\nToday, with the naira exchanging for over 560 for a dollar, many Nigerians are unable to feed themselves; access good healthcare; access portable water, pay their house rent, send their children to school or do other legitimate things as in a normal society.\n\nLife has become so difficult that many citizens are relocating abroad, with some renouncing their citizenship.\n\nToday in Nigeria, medical doctors who had graduated for many years are writing application and filing out to be interviewed by the Saudi Arabian authorities recruiting Nigerian medical personnel.\n\nA lady who lamented the development in a viral video on the social media said she was shocked to the point of giving up on Nigeria when she met a lecturer that taught her over many years ago, seeking the Saudi Arabia job.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s debt to hit N38.68trn in 2021 \u2013 Finance minister\n\nThis is the sad story of Nigeria as Buhari sent a letter to the National Assembly seeking approval for another batch of humongous loans.\n\nLast week, Buhari sought the approval of the National Assembly for external loans in the sum of $4,054,476,863.00, plus Euro \u20ac710m and grant component of $125m.\n\nThe loan request has been condemned across the country including leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and some federal lawmakers.\n\nThe new loan request followed last April\u2019s approval of external loans of $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million for the Federal Government.\n\nSince assuming office in 2015 the borrowing profile of the Buhari\u2019s administration has become increasingly worrisome to Nigerians.\n\nNever in the economic history has Nigeria been so intoxicated by debt and borrowing not even during the military regimes.\n\nIn the last five years, the Nigerian federal lawmakers have controversially approved large amounts of money to the government as loans for infrastructural projects and for other purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, observers say that the state of infrastructures and rising poverty among Nigerians are in sharp contrast to the huge borrowing of the Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nCivil society organisations across the country have equally spoken against President Buhari\u2019s penchant for borrowing.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the prudent management of such funds, while the citing of infrastructural projects executed in recent times has been said to be lopsided and in favour of a section of the country.\n\nBorrowing for consumption dangerous \u2013 Obi\n\nSpeaking recently on Nigeria\u2019s worrisome borrowing and its impact on Nigerians, Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, said that Nigerians were becoming poorer, while the economy was stagnating because the current administration was borrowing for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe former governor said developing countries across the world borrow money to execute policies, noting that Nigeria was rather borrowing money for consumption than production which would have a direct impact on the lives of citizens.\n\n\u201cAre you borrowing for productivity or are you borrowing for consumption? My worry here is that we are borrowing for consumption.\n\n\u201cI am saying that the country is not productive and there is nothing wrong in borrowing; if you are borrowing, then it shouldn\u2019t be for consumption and that\u2019s why more and more people are getting poorer,\u201d ObI said.\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Army, Ali Ndume, equally raised concerns about the new loan request by President Buhari, saying that the loan should be properly subjected to scrutiny.\n\nThe APC chieftain argued that a robust debate on the propriety of a new loan would address the concerns of Nigerians, who have since perceived the Senate as an appendage of the executive arm.\n\nSimilarly the main opposition, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), said that with the new loan request, and the alarming N35 trillion debt, President Buhari had allegedly mortgaged the future of Nigeria.\n\nBut the President said the loan when granted would stimulate the economy and create jobs. He said the funds were meant for projects geared toward the realisation of Nigeria\u2019s economy sustainability plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture, food security, energy, and covid-19 among others.\n\nReacting also, a former Minister of Transportation and chieftain of the PDP, Ebenezer Babatope warned President Buhari to be careful with his borrowing because of the poor state of the economy and increasing poverty among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEvery government can borrow, if he is borrowing to run the country fine, but he should not borrow to add to the suffering of Nigerians. Nigerians are already suffering too much,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso commenting, analyst and former publicity secretary of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Adelaja Adeoye urged the National Assembly to turn down Buhari\u2019s request, as it would further plug Nigeria into a difficult financial position.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI want to encourage the National Assembly to turn down the fresh loan request from President Buhari, because it will further put Nigeria into financial danger, as the 98% Debt Service-to-Revenue ratio portend grave danger for the country.\n\n\u201cThe existing loans are already putting massive pressure on the Economy, as our earnings to new loan ratio will lead to more budget deficit year in year out. Looking at the current public debt stock, you would realize that it is unsustainable despite the fact that our debt-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio at 35% seems comfortable, but that is not the deal.\n\n\u201cNational Assembly should look at the economic index and indices and heed experts\u2019 advice, so that the country is not further plunged into generational debts.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Adelaja however, seeks a review of the performance of all the loans pre and from 2015 since this administration came into power.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do as a country is to assess the performance of all the loans pre and from 2015 since this administration came into power, let us look at their uses and performance, how it is impacting on an average citizen, and also determine if we have capacity to repay them and what year would they be liquidated and be free.\n\n\u201cLet us hope that one day, we won\u2019t have to pay back these loans with our sovereignty, because the oil economy is becoming out of fashion around the world, with newer technologies, which is making the use of oil obsolete. Our major source of revenue is the oil economy.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, Buhari\u2019s fresh loan request, in a letter to the National Assembly seeking the legislature\u2019s approval of $4.179 billion ($4.054 billion and $125 million) and \u00a3710 million external loans should be halted\u201d.\n\n\u2018Everything has got worse\u2019\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BusinessDay Sunday, Martin Onovo, a former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP), said that the current administration has performed abysmally and has proven to be worst since 1999.\n\n\u201cIf you use this insecurity everybody is talking about, as at the day Buhari took over power, Nigeria was number 4 on the world terrorism index, today Nigeria is number 3. So, it has got worse. If you look at the poverty data as at the day Buhari took over power, you would see that we were not the global capital of extreme poverty, but with Buhari we became the global capital of extreme poverty. If you look at our transparent international corruption perception index reading, as at the day Buhari took over, I think we were 136th, today we are 149th; so, corruption has become worse. So, everything got worse. If you look at the economy, it is the same data, forget the 5percent they are reporting, it is false; because today Naira is N550 to a dollar, and still climbing. When Buhari took over it was 197.\n\n\u201cToday, your total national debt is nearly 40 trillion naira and you are going to borrow more now; the request is before the Senate, but when he took over it was 12.1trillion naira. So, nothing can be more catastrophic than the kind of democracy we think we are practising now. This regime is the worst since the creation of Adam that has failed in all counts. It failed in national unity; the economy, security, anti-corruption, democracy; it failed in the rule of law, in the integrity of the ballot and everywhere. The indices are clear. I am using government indices. The figures I am giving you are from Debt Management Office; they are there on their web site,\u201d Onovo said.\n\n\u201cSo, I am using government data. I am not a member of the board of global terrorism index; I am not a member of the board of world poverty clock,\u201d he further said.\n\nLet my people go \u2013 Ighodalo\n\nRecently, Ituah Ighodalo, senior pastor, The Trinity House Church, had lamented the precarious state of Nigeria and the style of leadership by political office holders.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know the people that are holding this country by the jugular and I don\u2019t think there are up to a thousand of them, but we need to go to each of them and speak to them to \u2018let my people go\u2019. All the gatekeepers of Nigeria holding on to the resources of this country not doing the things they should do; what they are expected to do.\u201d\n\nOn the excessive borrowing amid numerous resources in the country, the cleric said: \u201cWhy do we have a law in Nigeria in 2021 that does not allow us develop our national resources, and they say the thing belong to the Federal Government. Why are we wasting each other\u2019s time? There are all sorts or natural resources in the ground but the FG won\u2019t change the laws. There\u2019s more than enough to make Nigeria great. People are making gain with Anchor Borrowers scheme, even the vaccination; why are we doing this? We need to tell them and not just talking generally.\u201d",

          "text": "The presidency on Saturday said a total of 15 projects spread across the six geo-political zones of the country, will be financed with the external loans which President Muhammadu Buhari is seeking.\n\nBuhari had requested the Senate to approve sovereign loans of $4.054bn and \u20ac710million as well as grant components of $125m for the proposed projects.\n\nAccording to the letter by the President, the sovereign loans will be sourced from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE).\n\nRead also: CBN takes on abokifx founder over exchange rate breaches\n\nAccording to a statement by Garba Shehu, senior

well as the implementing Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nThe projects are to be financed under the 2018-2021 medium-term (rolling) external borrowing plan.\n\nA breakdown of the \u2018\u2018Addendum to the Proposed Pipeline Projects for the 2018-2021 Medium Term (rolling) External Borrowing Plan,\u2019\u2019 shows that the World Bank is expected to finance seven projects including the $125million grant for \u2018\u2018Better Education Services for All\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Education grant is expected to increase equitable access for out-of-school children and improve literacy in focus states.\n\nThe grant, which will be implemented by the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), will strengthen accountability for results in basic Education in Katsina, Oyo and Adamawa States.\n\nOther projects to be financed by the World Bank are, the State Fiscal, Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Programme for Results as well as the Agro-Processing, Productivity, Enhancement and Livelihood Improvement Support Project.\n\nThe benefiting States for the agro-processing project are, Kogi, Kaduna, Kano, Cross River, Enugu and Lagos with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as the implementing ministry.\n\nThe objective of the project is to enhance the

Nigeria Sustainable Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project in Delta, Ekiti, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina, Imo and Plateau States, for the next five years.\n\nThe project, when completed, is expected to improve rural water supply, sanitation and hygiene nationwide towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for water supply and sanitation by 2030.\n\nUnder the external borrowing plan, the World Bank supported projects also include Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Project (COPREP), under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Health and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nThe project, which has an implementation period of 5 years, will respond to threats posed by COVID-19 through the procurement of vaccines.\n\nFurthermore, no fewer than 29 States are listed as beneficiaries of the Agro-Climatic Resilience in Arid Zone Landscape project, which is expected to reduce natural resource management conflicts in dry and semi-arid ecosystems in Nigeria.\n\nThe benefiting states for the project to be co-financed by World Bank and European Investment Bank (EIB) are Akwa Ibom, Borno, Oyo, Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Edo, Plateau, Abia,

          "text": "The government of Anambra State has expressed sadness over the passing of elder statesman, Alhaji Abdulazeez Chivuzor Ude.\n\nA statement by the state\u2019s commissioner for information and public enlightenment, C Don Adinuba, said the state government received the news of Ude\u2019s passing with sadness, describing it a huge loss to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people and Government of Anambra State have received with sadness the news of the death two days ago of Chief Abdulaziz Chivuzor Ude, the internationally renowned publisher, intellectual, art lover, pan Africanist, entrepreneur and philanthropist from Abor, Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State who played a significant part in modern Igbo history. He died in Lagos in his late 80s, and was buried in his hometown in the afternoon yesterday in line with the Islamic injunction,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\n\u201cHe was Christened Bertrand at an early age and became the first senior prefect of the College of Immaculate Conception (CIC), Enugu, Ude attended Oxford University where he read philosophy, economics and politics before proceeding to Columbia University in New York where he took a master\u2019s degree in international relations.\n\n\u201cHe caught public attention when, while working as an editor at Random House in New York, the world\u2019s biggest book publishing firm, he published Chinua Achebe\u2019s classic, Things Fall Apart, in the United States during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-70. He was to strike a lifelong relationship with Achebe, and made handsome contributions to Achebe\u2019s Okike: A Journal of New African Writing, established in 1971 at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\n\u201cUde also struck a lifelong relationship in the late 1960s with such Anambra indigenes as Dr Chuba Okadigbo, then an academic in Washington, DC. He worked closely with Dr Okadigbo when the latter was appointed the Special Political Adviser to President Shehu Shagari from 1979 to 1983. When Okadigbo founded Platform, an analytical news magazine, based in Lagos, Chief Ude stood with him all the way, making critical financial interventions.\n\n\u201cThere were many persons of Anambra State origin in top management of his enterprises like Gordon and Georgi Umunna who worked on Financial Post. His friendship with the hugely popular musician, Chief Oliver Akanite from Nnewi South Local Government Area popularly known as Oliver de Coque, was such that the entertainer waxed an album dedicated to Chief Ude which turned out to be a national bestseller.\n\n\u201cUnknown to most people because of his self-effacing nature, Chief Ude contributed significantly to the creation of Anambra, Enugu, Delta and Ebonyi states. Apart from being one of the signatories to the petition for the creation of these states to the Ibrahim Babangida military regime, he donated not just cash but also his private jet to transport the Igbo patriots like Dr Alex Ekwueme, Chike Edozie, Dr Akanu Ibiam, Chief CC Onoh and Dr Okadigbo to different cities who signed the petition.\n\n\u201cHe also donated part of his building at 59 Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, to coordinate the campaign for the creation of Igbo states and paid the staff. The then traditional ruler of Enugwu Ukwu, Igwe Osita Agwuna, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost nationalists, was to confer a high title on him for services to the Igbo world.\n\n\u201cUde\u2019s Nok book publishing firm in Enugu, New York, London and Lagos, published such outstanding works as Chinweizu\u2019s The West and the Rest of Us and Romanus Egudu\u2019s Study of Four West Africans. Ude, in addition, financed Eddie Iroh\u2019s Chic, the London-based colourful social magazine. He was, indeed, a pan Africanist of the finest hue.\n\n\u201cAn active member of The African Business Round Table for several years, Ude awarded scholarships to hundreds of people to study in top universities in the world and assisted many others in different fields quietly. For example, he was a major promoter of the exhibitions of Aka: The Circle of Exhibiting Artists like Professor Obiora Udechukwu, Professor Chike Aniakor, Tayo Adenaike, Dr Obiora Anidi, Nsikak Essien, Chris Afuba, Bona Ezeudu and Boniface Okafor.\n\n\u201cEver humble, he practised egalitarianism in truth and spirit. He never discriminated against the less privileged or those who did not share his religious views. Even after converting to Islam, a result of his deep friendship with founding Guinean President Sekou Toure, a pan Africanist in his own right, Ude remained a big contributor to the welfare of priests and the church in his community.\n\n\u201cThe Government and people of Anambra State truly mourn the transition of this great Igboman, pan Africanist, publisher and intellectual. We mourn with the Ude family of Abor and the people and government of Enugu State.\n\n\u201cMay Abdulaziz Ude\u2019s noble soul find rest in paradise.\u201d",

          "title": "The Osun Federal Government Road Construction Refunds: The True State Of Affairs, By Bola Oyebamiji",
          "text": "My attention has been drawn to a viral video being circulated on the social media by the former Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr. Sikiru Ayedun, who by his unsubstantiated claims, could mislead the public through misrepresentation of facts on the state of refund by the Federal Government to the Osun State Government on all the federal roads constructed by the previous administration and the Osun debt portfolio management by the present administration.\n\nIn setting the records straight, it is important to emphatically and explicitly state that such claims, as presented in the video under reference, is capable of creating disharmony, strife and bad blood within the progressive family.\n\nThe claim that the sum of N48billion has been received by the Oyetola led administration as refund on federal roads constructed within the state is untrue.\n\nThe total contract sum of all federal road projects embarked upon by the Osun State Government, as approved by the Federal Ministry of Works, is N38billion. It is therefore against logic that the sum of N48bn will be paid by the FG for projects whose total contract sum equals N38bn. The projects in question, as at November, 2018, on the average, was less than 35% completion.\n\nAvailable records show that the Osun State Government awarded the 29km Gbongan \u2013 Akoda dualization project in 2013 for N29bn while the 40km Osogbo \u2013 Ikirun \u2013 Ila Odo Kwara boundary was awarded for N17.5bn in the same year, making both projects to amount to N46.5bn as proposed by Osun State Government. However, after due diligence and thorough assessment by the FG Public Procurement Agency, the contract sum was reviewed downward thus: Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road at N23bn, and Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road at N15bn respectively to carry the approved award contract sum of N38bn for all the ongoing FG roads under construction. This review was duly communicated to the Osun State Government.\n\nAs at November 2018, the contractor handling Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project had received a total sum of N10.2bn, out of which 3.5km of the 29km stretched road have been completed including the Gbongan Interchange and the project was at 29% completion while the contractor handling the Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road collected a total sum of N9.2bn, with 49% completion rate; the implication is that the Osun State Government had paid both contractors the sum of N19.4bn as at November 2018. Similarly, the total refund by the FG to the state as today, in three tranches, stood at N11.9bn based on the project delivered by both contractors. It is imperative to state that the FG refund of N11.9bn has been judiciously utilized and ploughed back into four (4) inherited road projects embarked upon by the previous administration contrary to the unsubstantiated claims by Mr. Ayedun that the refund is being used to pay full salaries to civil servants in the state.\n\nAs at today, Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project is at 36% completion stage, with 8.6km asphalted on both sides of the road. Also, the Osogbo \u2013 Ila odo project which was at 49% in November 2018 is now at 55% completion, Oba Adesoji Aderemi road which was equally inherited at 65% completion is at 74% now and Ilesa \u2013 Iperindo \u2013 Ipetu Ijesa road project rose from 40% to 66% completion stage. It is also instructive to note that since the advent of Oyetola administration, additional 60km of road had been reconstructed and fully completed, with another 10 township roads presently under construction; these are expected to be completed before the end of 2021 including the Iconic Olaiya flyover.\n\nWhile we refrain from joining issues with anyone, the State Government of Osun under the leadership of Gov. Gboyega Oyetola has expended over N150bn on prompt payment of full salaries and pensions. It is a fact that Osun State remains one of the few states paying minimum wage of N30,000 in spite of our precarious and highly geared financial situation. This is in fulfillment of the pact he made with Osun citizens when he assumed office in 2018. Whereas, it is true that both the state\u2019s N30bn and N11.4bn Sukuk bonds have been fully repaid, the current government has paid over N67bn as loan repayment during its 33months of administration in the State without borrowing a kobo till date.\n\nThe ingenuity and doggedness of Governor Gboyega Oyetola, has ensured a significant reduction in the total debt portfolio of Osun State.\n\nHowever, inspite of this unprecedented boldness in public financial management, Osun remains the third (3rd) most indebted state among the 36 states of Nigeria. This can be verified from the website of the Debt Management Office.\n\nWithout sounding like a broken record, let me reaffirm that Governor Gboyega Oyetola will continue to deploy his over 3 decades of managerial experience as a risk manager, a welfarist and financial guru to move the economy of the state towards prosperity of the larger percentage of Osun citizens.\n\nFinally, I urge all well meaning Osun citizens both politician and otherwise, to endeavour to verify all information before publication and dissemination. This will ensure a peaceful and healthy political atmosphere for all and sundry.\n\nThe State Government of Osun under Governor Gboyega Oyetola hereby reiterates her commitment to provide a secured, financially viable and paeceful environment so Osun may continue to thrive.\n\nI want to implore us as all political leaders and Omoluabis (virtuous people) to support Mr Governor in his quest for a greater Osun.\n\nBola Oyebamiji is the\n\nHonourable commissioner for Finance, Osun State",

          "text": "The most important determinant of the value of the Naira is whether or not the Nigerian economy is productive and competitive in international trade. That is to say, whether it has a diversified base of complex, value added products it exports and earns forex from those exports. I am not talking about diversification to cashew nuts and yam tubers. No. Those are primary commodities, not complex, value added ones that are the product of serious engineering and innovation.\n\nSince we obviously don\u2019t have such an economy, our main FX earner is crude oil, which gives us 90% of our FX. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t control the price of crude. Its pricing is volatile and unstable as a result of various international political and economic factors. This means that because we are essentially a one-product country, a one-trick pony, we are exposed to instability in our main income source. When the price of oil drops, and as the world innovates toward alternative energy sources, the amount of external reserves we have to back up the international value of our legal tender (our reserves) frequently comes under pressure. It\u2019s those reserves, our main defense in a soccer analogy, that determines the value of the Naira.\n\nThis is why, among the five main objectives of the Central Bank of Nigeria we have : \u201cissue the legal tender currency in Nigeria\u201d, and \u201cmaintain external reserves to safeguard the international value of the legal tender currency\u201d. So if we don\u2019t diversify but continue to rely on crude oil as a mono -product economy, the Naira crisis will get worse, not better.\n\nUnfortunately, achieving a diversified, complex economy, especially in a resource dependent economy, is not easy. It requires a a high level of knowledge, political will and consistency in economic policy and takes decades to achieve. This was the subject of my lecture a few months ago to the 2021 Annual Conference of the Nigerian Economics Students Association (NESA) held at the University of Port Harcourt, and will feature in my forthcoming book in 2022, The Pundit\u2019s Mind.\n\nThere are other facts as well that affect the value of the Naira. These include the basic factor of supply and demand (if too much Naira is chasing scarce dollars, the dollar gets stronger relative to the Naira, and vice versa). Others are inflation (a high inflation economy such as Nigeria\u2019s weakens the value of the legal tender), high government indebtedness ( again, our case especially relative to our revenues and ability to pay which will be stretched the more we borrow on poor revenues, and 90 kobo out of every N1 goes to debt servicing).\n\nSpeculation also affects the naira value, as there are currency traders around the world for whom the weakness of a currency is their very good fortune. Such traders \u201cattack\u201d such currencies for profit, especially where the currency is using a fixed, official exchange rate determined by the central bank instead of the market. As the Naira is effectively measured against a \u201creserve\u201d currency (dollars, euros, pound sterling), speculators can attack such a currency for profit if the country (Nigeria in this case) is perceived to have insufficient foreign reserves to meet demand.\n\nBecause our inflation rates at 17% are way higher than those \u201creserve-currency\u201d countries, again we are exposed to possible currency attacks. If reserves are weak, and demand for dollars massively outstrips supply, currency devaluation is inevitable, and currency traders who mount speculative attacks profit from this devaluation. Such traders will borrow the Naira from Nigerian banks, convert it to, say, dollars, then buy short-interest paying Nigerian bonds. If, as the speculators anticipate, the central bank devalues the naira, the traders sell the bonds in the foreign currency, convert them into naira, and repay the original Naira loan. The steeper the devaluation the higher the speculator\u2019s profit.\n\nWhat should we do about all of this? As I have said before, and say again, we have two options. One is to let the Naira find its level in the market. In order, words, the CBN should stop subsidizing the currency. While there will likely be an immediate spike in the price of the dollar, this move will have two advantages. The first is that, because Nigeria has a big, profitable economy and market, dollars will likely swamp the market seeking profits for investors.\n\nWhen this happens, the laws of demand and supply will work in favor of the Naira. Alongside this, maintaining different exchange rates for different kinds of transactions must end. This is called rate convergence.\n\nThe second, and more important benefit is that, since the current practice of the CBN pumping dollars in the FX market (from the reserves, which also depleted them) is essentially a subsidy for imports, which has made Nigeria more and more import dependent, letting go of the subsidy on the Naira will refocus the economy towards exports.\n\nThis will create an incentive for complex production of a quality that can be competitive in the international market. Accompanying this must be the right trade policies to support and create such incentives for massive exports of finished, value added goods from Nigeria.\n\nIf we don\u2019t want to go this way, perhaps because of the political risk of an immediate further drop in the Naira value (which will recover in the medium to longer term if the right policies are pursued), we can consider dollarization of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHere the dollar officially becomes a legal tender in Nigeria, either replacing the Naira or alongside it. Countries such as Panama, Liberia, Ecuador, Zimbabwe have done this.This\u2019ll lower interest rates and help deepen the financial sector because we are a high inflation country.\n\nBut this carries serious consequences too. Nigeria will lose monetary autonomy (our central bank will no longer be able to take independent decisions on interest rates for example). The CBN will lose seigniorage, the revenues it earns from issuing currency from the difference between the face value of the Naira and its production cost. And of course, this will involve a loss of national prestige and independence. You could argue, of course, that what value is your prestige when your national economy is in tatters? So, there we are, the simplified A-Z of our FX crisis. Either way, tough decisions have to be made. Politics is easy. Real leadership is not.\n\nKingsley Moghalu OON\n\nIfekaego Nnewi",

          "text": "Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, an umbrella body for governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr. Salihu Moh\u2019 Lukman, has described as retrogressive politics the clamour by some State governors to control collection of Value Added Tax, VAT, in Nigeria.\n\nLukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike had sued and secured court judgment against the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, over the right of the State to control the collection of VAT.\n\nWike lamented injustice and inequitable distribution of resources generated from VAT, arguing that \u2018Rivers State generated about N15 billion as VAT in June 2021 but received only N4.7 billion, Lagos State generated over N46 billion as VAT in June, but got just over N9 billion, whereas Kano State generated N2.8 billion and also got N2.8 billion as allocation.\u2019\n\nIn his statement titled, \u2018Retrogressive Politics of Value Added Tax in Nigeria\u2019, issued Friday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, the APC chieftain wondered if State collection of VAT was going to prioritise the development of the nation\u2019s productive capacity or rather simply be about consuming the resources that are currently available, stressing that access may not necessarily translate into commitment to utilise the resources in ways that strengthened commitment of political leaders to invest in the development of Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nHe emphasized that if the priority is about consuming currently available resources, commitment of political leaders to mobilise investment to develop the nation\u2019s productive sectors will be weak, hence it is important to ensure that access to resources also come with increased commitment by political leaders towards developing Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nThe PGF DG maintained that the reason Nigerians are debating whether it is states or federal government that should collect VAT is as a result of significant increase in what is being generated from VAT, thereby making it an attractive variable in the struggle for resource control by State governments.\n\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\nHe berated the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for generating very low income from VAT on account of both combination of weak institutional capacity and corruption in the public sector during its 16 years reign in power.\n\n\u201cNo matter what anyone want to say, the reality is that the significant increase in VAT in the country between 2015 and 2020 confirmed improved efficiency and reduced corruption in the process of collection and management of Nigeria\u2019s public finances.\n\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari. Whether it would have been possible if PDP is still in control of the federal government can only be wishful thoughts. If that were to be the case, why wasn\u2019t it the case at any point between 1999 and 2015?,\u201d he asked.\n\nLukman added that, \u201cGovernor Wike can audaciously and shamelessly talk about VAT today because, its value has significantly increased which made it attractive for a rich State like Rivers to be interested in controlling it. If Governor Wike has any morality, he should look back and acknowledge how small Rivers must have received as its VAT share before 2015. Being a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\n\n\u201cAs members of APC, it is important that Governor Wike is reminded that the current increased record of VAT collection in the country is made possible only because the PDP is no longer in power. If PDP were to be in power the fact of inefficiency and corruption in the process of collection and management of VAT would have continued and the amount collected would have remained relatively low. It is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government. This is because one of the specific commitment of APC since 2015 as outlined in the section of the party\u2019s manifesto Funding a New Nigeria was that \u2018APC government will set about the urgent task of getting Nigeria\u2019s public finances in order, by tackling the massive waste, duplication and corruption in the system, diversifying the economy and expanding our tax base to increase non-oil revenues, and reprioritising public spending away from bureaucracy towards investment in infrastructure and improved frontline services.\u2019\u201d",
          "summary": "Lukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari.\nBeing a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\nIt is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government.",

Some of these include 475grams of heroin concealed in food items going to Canada;\n\n202grams of cocaine hidden in body cream containers going to Australia; 720grams of Cannabis Sativa tucked in computer hard drives heading to United Arab Emirates, UAE and another 2.1kg of cannabis hidden in body cream bottles going to Oman, while 60grams of cocaine concealed in degree certificates meant for Australia was also seized, all from three courier firms in Lagos.\n\nCuriously, a 38-year-old pregnant woman, Kate Ngozi Nwuju was arrested on Tuesday 14th Sept at her residence in Rumueme, Mile 4 area of Port Harcourt, Rivers state with 4.5kilograms of cannabis following intelligence that she sells drugs.\n\nAlso, one Aliyu Saidu, suspected to be a fake soldier was arrested with 2.3kg of Cannabis Sativa in a commercial bus from Lagos to Makurdi, on Monday 13th of Sept at Aliade checkpoint, Benue State.\n\nIn Kano, one Shuaibu Yusuf, was arrested on Friday 17th Sept with 537kg of cannabis sativa, concealed among bags of cement in a truck, while in Ogun state, five persons were arrested on Tuesday 14th Sept after their truck conveying 552kg cannabis was intercepted at Ogere Remo, along Lagos-Ibadan expressway. In a related development, narcotic officers on motorised patrol on Friday 17th Sept, arrested a 21-year-old Law Ubi at Marian Road, Calabar, Cross River state with 67.4 kg cannabis while a follow up search of his residence the following day, Saturday, led to the recovery of 4.2grams of Cocaine from his apartment.\n\nIn Edo, operatives stormed remote forests in Ovia North East area of the state between 8th and 16th Sept, destroyed over 14 hectares of cannabis farms, and recovered 172.6kg of cannabis. Three female and a male suspects were also arrested in raids across Owan East and Akoko Edo areas of the state. Different quantities of cannabis and local mixtures called monkey tail were recovered from them.\n\nCommending the officers and men of the Lagos airport, Abuja airport, Benue, Kano, Ogun, Rivers, Cross River and Edo commands as well as those of the Directorate of Operation and General Investigation, DOGI, of the Agency for maintaining the heat on drug dealers, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) said their efforts \u201cfurther reaffirm our determination that those in this criminal trade will always have the new NDLEA to contend with; whether in their homes, on the streets, at the ports and deep in the forests, we\u2019ll chase them with every legitimate force and smoke them out, up to the last man or woman if they fail to repent.\u201d",

          "text": "A day after the United States military admitted that a drone attack in Afghanistan\u2019s capital last month mistakenly killed 10 members of a family, including seven children, survivors have said Washington\u2019s apology was not enough.\n\nAimal Ahmadi, whose three-year-old daughter Malika was killed on August 29, when the US hellfire missile struck his elder brother\u2019s car, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that the family demands Washington investigate who fired the drone in the Kabul attack.\n\n\u201cI lost 10 members of my family; I want justice from the USA and other organisations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are innocent people, we didn\u2019t do any mistake.\u201d\n\nToys, sandals & photos with relatives at the compound where six children were killed by a US drone.\n\nThe US admits it was an attack which killed civilians \u2013 but there will be no repercussions for those who sanctioned or carried it out.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Osama Bin Javaid, who visited the site of the attack, said memorabilia of the children, including their toys, could be seen scattered.\n\n\u201cFamily members told us that they are looking for compensation from the US. They want justice for their family members and if possible those who have remained in this compound want to leave Afghanistan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere in this compound, there is death, misery and memories of those who passed, and people who try to rebuild their lives in the mayhem of what is Afghanistan and what happened to their families.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Associated Press news agency, Ahmadi said the US should punish the military personnel responsible for the strike.\n\n\u201cThat is not enough for us to say sorry,\u201d said Ahmadi. \u201cThe US should find the person who did this.\u201d\n\nNews organisations reported after the attack that the driver of the targeted vehicle, Zemerai Ahmadi, was a longtime employee at a US humanitarian organisation and cited an absence of evidence to support the Pentagon\u2019s assertion that the vehicle contained explosives.\n\nThe missile struck as the car was pulling into the family\u2019s driveway and the children ran to greet Zemerai.\n\nOn Friday, US Marine General Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, called the attack a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d, and after weeks of denials, said that innocent civilians were indeed killed in the attack and not a fighter associated with the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, ISKP (ISIS-K), as originally claimed by the US military.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the strike, I was confident that the strike had averted an imminent threat to our forces at the airport. It was a mistake, and I offer my sincere apology,\u201d McKenzie said, adding the US was considering making reparation payments to the family of the victims.\n\nA day after the attack, family members told Al Jazeera that the 10 people killed ranged in age from two to 40 years old.\n\n\u201cThey were innocent, helpless children,\u201d Ahmadi told Al Jazeera at the time.\n\nMcKenzie said the decision to strike the white Toyota Corolla sedan, after having tracked it for about eight hours, was made in an \u201cearnest belief\u201d \u2013 based on a standard of \u201creasonable certainty\u201d \u2013 that it posed an imminent threat to US forces at the Kabul airport. The car was believed to have been carrying explosives in its boot, he said.\n\nBut Ahmadi wondered how his family\u2019s home could have been mistaken for an ISKP hideout.\n\n\u201cThe US can see from everywhere,\u201d he said of US drone capabilities. \u201cThey can see that there were innocent children near the car and in the car. Whoever did this should be punished.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t right,\u201d he added.\n\nEven as evidence mounted to the contrary, Pentagon officials asserted that the attack had been conducted correctly, to protect the US troops remaining at Kabul\u2019s airport ahead of the final pullout the following day, on August 30.\n\nThe drone attack followed a devastating suicide bombing by ISKP \u2013 a rival of the Taliban \u2013 that killed 169 Afghans and 13 US military personnel at one of the gates to the Kabul airport. For days, desperate Afghans had swarmed the checkpoints outside the airport, trying to leave the country amid the chaotic US and NATO troops\u2019 pullout, fearing for their future under the Taliban.\n\nMcKenzie\u2019s admission is a significant departure from the Department of Defense\u2019s previous statements about the drone attack. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the attack as \u201crighteous\u201d several days after it was conducted.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin released a statement on Friday also calling the attack a \u201chorrible mistake\u201d.\n\nMembers of Congress also called for a thorough investigation into the matter, including Betty McCollum, chair of the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said on Friday he will investigate \u201cthe accuracy and completeness of public statements\u201d that the Pentagon made defending the attack.\n\nAhmadi insisted an official apology will not bring back members of his family, and said he was frustrated that it took weeks of pleading with Washington to at least make a call to the family.\n\nLooking exhausted, sitting in front of the charred ruins of Zemerai\u2019s car, Ahmadi said he wanted more than an apology from the US \u2013 he wanted justice, including an investigation into who carried out the strike \u201cand I want him punished by the USA\u201d.\n\nZemerai was the family\u2019s breadwinner and had looked after his three brothers, including Emal, and their children.\n\nInternational aid groups and the United Nations have warned of a looming humanitarian crisis that could drive most Afghans below the poverty level.\n\n\u201cNow I am then one who is responsible for all my family and I am jobless,\u201d said Emal.",

          "text": "Liverpool remain unbeaten in the Premier League this season after Sadio Mane scored his 100th goal for the club in a victory against Crystal Palace.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s side created numerous chances against a resilient Palace before Mane pounced on a rebound at the back post in the first half.\n\nMohamed Salah doubled their lead with just over 10 minutes remaining when he smashed home a flick-on from a corner, before Naby Keita\u2019s late curling strike made it 3-0.\n\nLiverpool were wasteful in the first half as Diogo Jota fired over the bar from a few yards out in a glorious position, while Thiago and Jordan Henderson were also denied by keeper Vicente Guaita.\n\nPalace had started brightly \u2013 hitting the post twice in as many minutes as Liverpool failed to clear their lines in the box \u2013 but the hosts\u2019 persistence eventually paid off.\n\nIn the end it was a comfortable victory that capped a good week for Liverpool at Anfield, following their dramatic 3-2 win over AC Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nAnd it means they go top of the table with four wins from their opening five games, while visitors Palace remain outside the top 10.\n\nMane was one of six changes to Klopp\u2019s side from their win over AC Milan, and his return must have been an unpleasant sight for Palace fans.\n\nHaving scored twice against Palace on the final day of last season, Mane\u2019s opener on Saturday made him the first player to net in nine consecutive league matches against a single opponent.\n\nIt took his total to 13 against Palace in the Premier League \u2013 the most anyone has scored against them \u2013 and was the perfect way to notch up his 100th goal in all competitions for Liverpool.\n\nPalace had attacking threat of their own from Wilfried Zaha \u2013 making his 250th Premier League appearance \u2013 but he was dealt with by the physicality of Fabinho and debutant Ibrahima Konate.\n\nAnd while Palace continue to adapt and learn under new boss Patrick Vieira, they were given a humbling reminder of the ruthlessness of Liverpool\u2019s attacking quality.",
