          "text": "Russia stepped up air strikes on Kyiv on Saturday, hitting another military factory a day after Moscow warned it would renew attacks following two weeks of relative calm in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nSmoke rose from the Darnyrsky district in the southeast of the capital after what Moscow said were \u201chigh-precision long-range\u201d strikes on the armaments plant.\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said authorities were still determining whether anyone had been killed or injured in the attack.\n\nA heavy police and military presence was deployed around the factory, the day after a similar strike on a plant that produced the Neptune missiles Kyiv and Washington say sunk Russia\u2019s Black Sea naval flagship on Thursday.\n\nRussia, which used sea-based long-range missiles to hit the Vizar plant on Friday, says that the Moskva missile cruiser sank while being towed back to port after ammunition exploded on board.\n\nAmid escalating tit-for-tat sanctions since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24, Russia on Saturday said it was banning entry to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and several other top UK officials.\n\n\u201cThis step was taken as a response to London\u2019s unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for restricting our country and strangling the domestic economy,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry accused London of \u201cunprecedented hostile actions\u201d, in particular referring to sanctions on Russia\u2019s senior officials.\n\n\u201cThe British leadership is deliberately aggravating the situation surrounding Ukraine, pumping the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the behalf of NATO,\u201d the ministry said.\n\n\u2013 Sanctions \u2013\n\nBritain has been part of an international effort to punish Russia with asset freezes, travel bans and economic sanctions, and Moscow\u2019s new entry blacklist includes Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.\n\nSaturday\u2019s strike on the Ukrainian capital was among the first since invading Russian forces began withdrawing from regions around Kyiv last month, instead turning their focus on gaining control of the eastern Donbas region.\n\nKyiv regional governor Oleksandr Pavliuk said there were at least two other Russian strikes on the city Friday and that civilians thinking about returning should \u201cwait for quieter times.\u201d\n\nResidential areas of Kyiv were struck repeatedly at the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine from late February. Moscow has denied intentionally striking civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Big blow\u2019 \u2013\n\nA Pentagon official said that the sinking of the Moskva, which had been leading Russia\u2019s naval effort in the seven-week conflict, was a \u201cbig blow\u201d for Moscow, while the fate of its crew of more than 500 was uncertain.\n\nThe official said survivors were observed being recovered by other Russian vessels, but Ukrainian authorities said bad weather had made rescue operations impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big blow symbolically,\u201d the Pentagon official said. \u201cThere is a pride aspect.\u201d\n\nLosing the Moskva \u2013 one of just three Slava-class cruisers in Moscow\u2019s fleet \u2014 creates a \u201ccapability gap\u201d for the Russian navy in southern Ukraine, he said.\n\nUnder the Montreux convention Turkey keeps the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits closed to warships in times of conflict, meaning Moscow cannot dispatch a replacement for the Moskva to the Black Sea.\n\nRussia\u2019s Black Sea fleet has been blockading the besieged port city of Mariupol, where Russian officials say they are in full control although Ukrainian fighters are still holed up in the city\u2019s fortress-like steelworks.\n\nThe United States pledged a new $800-million military aid package for Ukraine this week, including helicopters, howitzers and armoured personnel carriers, and on Friday the German government said it plans to release more than a billion euros ($1.1 billion) in aid as well.\n\nUS media reported that Russia had sent a formal complaint to Washington about its support of Kyiv this week.\n\nIn the diplomatic note, Moscow warned the United States and NATO against sending the \u201cmost sensitive\u201d weapons, saying such shipments were \u201cadding fuel\u201d to the situation and could come with \u201cunpredictable consequences\u201d, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\u2013 Focus on east \u2013\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Friday that Russia might use nuclear weapons out of desperation as its invasion falters, echoing recent comments by CIA director William Burns.\n\n\u201cThey could do it, I mean they can,\u201d Zelensky told CNN. \u201cFor them, life of the people is nothing.\u201d\n\nFor now, Russia\u2019s military focus seems set on seizing the eastern Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists control the Donetsk and Lugansk areas.\n\nThis would allow Moscow to create a southern corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula, and Ukrainian authorities have been urging people in the region to quickly move west in advance of a large-scale Russian offensive.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Uncertainties as 18 aspirants jostle for Enugu governorship in PDP",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Dennis Agbo\n\nAt the close of sales and submission of expression of interest and nomination forms of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the 2023 general election, on Friday, no less than 18 aspirants had purchased the governorship forms for Enugu state.\n\nThose who are said to have purchased the PDP nomination forms include Dr Josef-Ken Onoh, Mr Godwin Ogenyi, Hon. Chijioke Edeoga, Prof. Bart Nnaji, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Pastor Beloved Dan Anike, Engr. Erasmus Anike, Senator Gil Nnaji, Capt. Everest Nnaji, Mr. Peter Mba, Dr. G.O.C Aja, Dr. Kingsley Udeh, Rev. Ralph Nwoye, Dr. Abraham Nneji, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, Hon. Offor Chukwuegbo, Prof Jehu Nnaji and Prof. Hillary Edeoga.\n\nOutside the PDP, the only other political party, where aspirants have indicated an interest in the governorship is in the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, where Mr Frank Nweke jnr, Chief Dons Udeh and Mr. Jeff Nnamani have reportedly purchased nomination forms for the governorship position. In the All Progressives Congress, APC, only Dr. Dave Nnamani from Isi-Uzo has openly indicated interest to contest the position, using the APC platform.\n\nOne interesting feature of the aspirants is that 99.9 percent of them hail from Enugu East Senatorial district, except for Ike Ekweremadu, who is probably the only person in Enugu state that is insisting that there was no governorship zoning arrangement in the state. Since Ekweremadu declared interest to contest for the governorship, different groups, including political, traditional and religious leaders have in different ways asked him to respect the zoning convention in the state and avoid creating crisis in the state, yet Ekweremadu and his followers have insisted on the contest. His fate will be decided by the PDP delegates, after if he succeeds, he will face the generality of the state at the polling units.\n\nOne of the present political confusions in the state is the inability of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to openly anoint a successor. The Governor has kept mute over his preference of who will succeed him, which made no less than the 18 aspirants buy the nomination forms at N21 million each, thus making the PDP rake up no less than N378 million from Enugu state alone. Ugwuanyi\u2019s silence has led to so many allegations and insinuations, among them, is the allegation that the Governor\u2019s proxies met with some of the aspirants outside Nigeria, where a deal was allegedly struck on who will succeed the Governor.\n\nThere is also an insinuation that the Governor may at the end of the day fool everybody into believing that he has a successor in mind whereas he has none and will throw the contest open for whoever is the mightiest.\n\nHowever, there is a belief that among the sea of aspirants are only three members of the Governor\u2019s kitchen cabinet, who are believed to have been mentored by Ugwuanyi and whom the Governor may at the end of the day choose one the three to support as successor. The three are Dr Kingsley Udeh who is the Governor\u2019s Adviser on Education; Hon. Chijioke Edeoga who has just resigned as the Commissioner for Environment and Dr Ken Onoh who is the Chairman of Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority, ECTDA. In the case of Udeh, he is generally unknown but his major albatross is his Nkanu west local government council of origin that produced former governor Chimaroke Nnamani who is presently a senator and has picked the 2023 nomination form to go back to the Senate. There is an objection in the state over return of power back to Nkanu west.\n\nHon. Chijioke Edeoga, no doubt is a consummate politician, he has been around for a while, starting as a council chairman to the House of Representatives, Presidential Adviser and to being a commissioner. His has the advantage of \u2018Ka Isi-Uzo Jee\u2019, a campaign slogan that has thrown up issues of marginalization, discrimination by fellow senatorial constituents and a campaign of productivity by the Isi-Uzo people.\n\nDr. Ken Onoh is however the Man that the moods of the people tend to favour. The people said he is young, charismatic, and has proved that he has the courage to succeed in a task such as a governorship. With the many feats he achieved in the Enugu Capital Territory, residents believe that it\u2019s a test case of what he can achieve if given governorship. Onoh\u2019s problem, however, is the law offenders, whom he could not give exemptions in enforcing them to abide by the town planning regulations, but that is where he gained the public support.\n\nThe Enugu residents said that they want a next governor who could provide the state with water, fix the dilapidated roads, re-event the Sullivan Chime urban renewal model and return the state to a true position of Eastern Nigeria\u2019s capital. They contend that Enugu has down and needs the energy in the like of Onoh to bring back resilience to the state.\n\nThere is also the suspicion of Mr. Godwin Ogenyi\u2019s entrant into the race. Ogenyi is a development consultant who was commissioned for Poverty Reduction and Human Capital Development under the Chime administration. His entrant into the race elicits concerns that he may throw a surprise in the contest.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\n\u2026Calls on int\u2019l community to beam searchlight on horrendous massacres of peoples under Buhari\u2019s watch\n\nWorried by the renewed spate of killings across the North, especially the region, the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has called on its people to use whatever is available to defend themselves against these bloodthirsty invaders.\n\nThe Forum noted that this call become imperative because they have lost faith in the capacity of President Muhammadu Buhari to secure the lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nDr. Pogu Bitrus, the National President of the MBF, lamented in a statement issued Friday in Abuja that the refusal of the government to deal with perpetrators of these recurring killings reveals its complicity in the gale of bloodshed shredding the Middle Belt Region.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe call on our peoples to be alert and use whatever is available to them to stand firm and resist these bloodthirsty invaders.\n\n\u201cWe call on our communities to be security conscious as they celebrate Easter. We must never allow ourselves to be caught unawares by those inflicting all forms of barbarities and threatening our existential survival.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads,\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has been drawn to the renewed vicious attacks on communities of the Middle Belt Region in Southern Kaduna, Southern Kebbi, Niger, Plateau and Benue State that have led to hundreds of lives lost and decimation of our once-thriving communities.\n\n\u201cOn March 8, 2022, daredevil terrorists mounted an ambush for members of a vigilante group called \u2018Yan-Sa-Kai\u2019 in Zuru, Kebbi State, and eventually killed 65 of them. Attempts by the security forces to bring the bandits to justice led to the murder of 13 soldiers and five policemen, bringing the total number of the dead to 83.\n\n\u201cOne week after the assault on Zuru Emirate, the blood-thirsty criminals attacked a police station in Nasko town in Magala Local Government Area of Niger State on March 15, 2022, where they slaughtered no fewer than eight people, comprising the divisional police officer, three policemen and four members of the community\u2019s vigilante group.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSTATE OF THE NATION: Stakeholders, ADC, canvass ways to end insecurity\n\n\u201d One week after the murder of the DPO and seven others in Nasko, another group of butchers, dressed in military uniforms, on March 22, 2022, launched an attack on four communities: Tsonje, Agban, Katanga and Kadarko, all within Kagoro Chiefdom in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State. No fewer than 34, according to the Kaduna State Government, were murdered and 35 homes razed down.\n\n\u201cLess than seven days after the bedlam on the four Kagoro communities, members of a madcap gang bombed an Abuja-Kaduna bound train on March 28, 2022. The blood-spilling outlaws abducted scores of passengers and murdered eight persons, among others. The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) is yet to account for the whereabouts of 165 passengers that were on the ill-fated trip.\n\n\u201cWhile the nation was mourning these avoidable murders, another deadly assault on Kadanye village in Kajuru LGA and Akilbu village in Kachia LGA left eight persons, mostly women and children, dead, while 28 were abducted on April 6, 2022.\n\n\u201cThese killings seemed to have hit the peak on Sunday, April 10, 2022, when another group of armed brigands pounced on four villages in Kanam Local Government Area of Plateau State and killed about 80 people in cold blood. While these communities were still in deep mourning, another terror group launched yet another deadly assault on a military base located in Pole Wire Village in Birnin Gwari LGA of Kaduna State, slaying 12 soldiers and injuring 19 military personnel.\n\n\u201cTo clearly convince the world they were in charge, the bandits, in a video clip shot in front of the captured armoured tank, announced the release of the Managing Director of Bank of Agriculture, Alhaji Alwan Ali Hassan, on compassionate grounds. Though they hinged the release of the BOA MD on the Ramadan season, the terrorists threatened to kill the kidnapped train passengers if the government did not meet their demands.\n\n\u201cAnother group of gunmen would re-enact a horror scene on Monday, April 11, 2022, in three local government areas of Logo, Tarka and Guma in Benue State by killing no fewer than 25 persons, including a traditional ruler, Zaki Unongo Shaayange. In the three attacks on Plateau, Kaduna and Benue that took place within 24 hours, no fewer than 117 lives were lost, including 12 military personnel.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive that as the 2023 campaigns gather momentum, the intensity of these attacks is set to increase, with the sole purpose of annihilating communities of the Middle Belt by the invaders.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the level of massacres, the devastation of communities and kidnapping of members of the Middle Belt Region extraction is aimed at impoverishing and disempowering the people and creating chaos that will render them refugees in their own ancestral homes.\n\n\u201cThe Middle Belt Forum completely condemns this gradual return to the bloody days of horrifying assaults that are presently assuming a genocidal level. No nation can survive this level of crippling insecurity that has rendered life short and brutish for many communities in the Middle Belt Region.\n\n\u201cWe are irrevocably convinced that the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari has abandoned its constitutional responsibility of stopping these recurring deadly attacks on our peoples.\n\n\u201cWe are still at a loss why the government has not found it expedient to engage local communities on how best to defend themselves against these highly sophisticated terrorists.\n\nThe Forum completely aligns with the position of the Benue State Governor, His Excellency Dr Samuel Ortom who has declared that our besieged communities must rise up to the challenges of the time and defend their lives and property.\n\n\u201cWe call on the international community to beam its searchlight on the horrendous massacres of the Middle Belt peoples being carried out under the watch of President Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe refusal of the government to deal with perpetrators of these recurring killings reveals its complicity in the gale of bloodshed shredding the Middle Belt Region.\n\n\u201cThe Middle Belt Region has lost faith in the capacity of President Buhari to secure the lives and property of Nigerians. We call on our people to be alert and use whatever is available to them to stand firm and resist these bloodthirsty invaders.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Senior Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Pastor Adewale Giwa has disclosed that the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo was the brain behind the failed 2015 manifesto of the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nAccording to the pastor, it was surprising that Osinbajo declared to run for presidency despite his contribution to the current quagmire Nigeria is facing.\n\nGiwa, who stated this in Akure, the Ondo State capital, over the weekend, stressed that the Vice President has nothing to bring to the table following what he described as woeful performance of the APC-led government since 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny to me to see Professor Yemi Osinbajo declaring to run for the office of the President of Nigeria having failed to fulfill, at least one of their 2015 manifesto promises.\n\n\u201cLet me remind Nigeria that Mr. Osinbajo played a prominent role in drafting the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress that put Nigeria in serious trouble. The document, called \u201cRoadmap to a New Nigeria,\u201d has led the country to where she is today.\n\n\u201cTell me, if he becomes the President, what would he do differently? It\u2019s time Nigerians come together and seriously demand for a referendum. Neither Osinbajo nor Tinubu or anybody can be a good president unless we change the way Nigeria was formed. We have to go back to what led to the amalgamation of Nigeria; change the name of this country given by a foreigner and change our constitution.\n\n\u201cNobody, I repeat, nobody can make a good president unless we address the aforementioned issues. Nigeria will go out of the \u201cfrying pan to fire\u201d, if care is not taken. We will go from a bad situation to a situation that is even worse if Osinbajo, Tinubu or anybody becomes the president without properly organizing a referendum.\n\n\u201cThere are many factors that won\u2019t make Osinbajo to perform. He is loyal to president Muhammadu Buhari. They both borrowed money from China; Don\u2019t expect Professor Osinbajo to probe his boss. Only an insane person would think that Osinbajo will produce a good result. As a matter of fact, the upcoming presidential election is a joke.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cas a matter of fact, all those who aspire to become the next president of Nigeria are fooling themselves. They are selfish politicians, looking for what they want to acquire for themselves, relatives and friends.\n\n\u201cIf an angel falls from heaven to become the next president of Nigeria without addressing salient issues that have to do with the1999 constitution, referendum, etc, the masses will continue to wallow in abject poverty and nothing would change for better.\n\n\u201cThey know this, and that\u2019s why none of them is interested to talk about it. All they are after is to continue to lead on bad policies. We have to rebuild the foundation of Nigeria, change the constitution and come together to discuss the way out.\u201d",

          "text": "Helen Ozioma, the lady who called off her wedding to David Okike, has denied aborting three pregnancies belonging to him.\n\nOzioma also known as Ada Uburu accused Okike of domestic abuse, leading her to call off the wedding, which should have taken place today in Abakalili, capital of Ebonyi State.\n\nBut Okike debunked the allegations and accused her of deliberately aborting their pregnancies.\n\nHe also accused her of shifting their weeding many times before calling it off last week.\n\nBut Ozioma, in a reaction on Saturday, said she didn\u2019t abort the pregnancies.\n\nRather, she alleged she suffered two miscarriages because of physical assault.\n\nDisplaying a medical report of the last miscarriage, she said the doctors had to carry out an emergency operation to evacuate the dead foetus from her womb.\n\nShe said: \u201cEven when I took in, I will tell him to give me even if it\u2019s a little space like a month before sex so that I won\u2019t miscarry but he won\u2019t. Rather he will drag with me and end up beating me.\n\n\u201cHe practically caused all the miscarriages I went through by his beating and not even having a common self control.\n\n\u201cIt was never an abortion, it was two miscarriages and I have my evidence.\n\n\u201cPlease look into the scan result below From Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cThat was the pregnancy that I miscarried last year due to his violence and rage which he said Teaching Hospital Abakaliki aborted his baby without his consent.\n\n\u201cIf the Hospital have CCTV, it will be recorded right there because it was his eldest sister Juliana Okike who accompanied me to the hospital,\u201d she claimed.\n\nShe added: \u201cWhy did she accompany me and not my supposed husband? He kept giving excuses, babe wait next week, next week that never finishes.\n\n\u201cWomen who had witnessed miscarriages will tell you how painful and heartbroken it is to know that you are carrying nothing and you\u2019re still carrying it.\n\n\u201cMy good people in my own case my supposed husband kept delaying everything. I kept begging him that even if he doesn\u2019t want to go with me to the hospital that his eldest sister Juliana Okike is a health worker, he should send her with me, after everything he accepted.\n\n\u201cIt was a miscarriage and only God knows what I went through.\u201d\n\nOzioma further noted despite the alleged abuse by her fiancee, she was ready to go ahead with the wedding but the death of popular singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, made her have a rethink and call off the marriage.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough to call off the wedding at first. My intention was \u2018I am already in this mess. if eventually we got married and everything keep being bad if God wishes we will go our separate ways.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was why at some point I started fighting for \u201cCourt marriage\u201d which with both the help of our church pastor and my supposed husband\u2019s immediate elder sister he accepted to do the court marriage with me,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe said the day Osinachi\u2019s death was announced, her fiancee beat her up again.\n\n\u201cIt was his immediate elder sister that even pushed me into their own room and locked the door to protect me.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect them to be truthful about if their brother always beat me or not after all my supposed husband is their only son and brother.\n\nREAD ALSO: Man whose fianc\u00e9e called off wedding denies physical abuse allegations\n\n\u201cMy heart was shattered not just only for Minister Osinachi Nwachukwu\u2019s death but for myself seeing my death and because of what people will say I am trying to walk through it.So that night I didn\u2019t sleep I got a rethink.\u201d\n\nShe also said she sought advice from Police officers in their community who advised her to quit the marriage.\n\nOn her fiancee\u2019s accusation of shifting the marriage severally, she said her family\u2019s opposition to the marriage was responsible for the postponements.\n\nShe said despite the resistance from her family, she insisted on going ahead to marry him.\n\n\u201cAfter all my fight and I succeeded for the marriage to hold he turned against me.\n\n\u201cHe kept beating me in any little provocation because he knew I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to.\n\n\u201cAfter all at first my family asked me not to marry him that it\u2019s against tradition and I decided to disobey everybody, all my family and friends turned their backs on me.\n\n\u201cAt that point I don\u2019t know who to talk to, all I always do is to call the Chairman of our kindred to report to him how my supposed husband has been abusing me,\u201d she added.",

          "text": "While a divorce typically signifies the end of a relationship, it wasn\u2019t the case for these celebrities who married their exes for a second time.\n\nBelow are some celebrities who remarried the same spouses:\n\n1. Eminem\n\nRapper Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, was first married to Kim Scott from 1999 until 2001. Their marriage ended badly with Kim being the subject of many of his songs. However, they overcame their differences and married again in 2006, before divorcing within 12 months.\n\n2. Elon Musk\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk started dating British actress Talulah Riley in 2008, with the couple going on to marry in 2010. The couple split just two year later but re-married just a year later in July 2013. Unfortunately, their second marriage also failed, and the couple\u2019s second divorce was finalised in 2016.\n\n3. Jean-Claude VanDamme\n\nMovie star and martial artist Jean-Claude VanDamme married his current wife, Gladys Portugues for the first time in 1987.\n\nThe couple split in 1992 but remarried seven years later in 1999. \u201cThe JCVD family is still strong,\u201d the actor told the Daily Mail.\n\n4. Marie Osmond\n\nMarie Osmond also had better luck second time round with her partner Steve Craig. The pair were married for three years from 1982 until 1985, with Marie going on to marry Brian Blosil the following year. Although she was married to Brian until 2007, Marie found love once again with Steve, and the couple remarried in 2011.\n\n5. Richard Burton\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton met and fell in love on the set of Cleopatra in 1963. Both were married to other people at the time, so this was very scandalous. They eventually got divorced and then married each other again in 1964.\n\nIt ended after ten years, due to Richard Burton having an affair with someone else, according to Marie Claire.\n\n6. Melanie Griffith\n\nMovie stars Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson met when she was just 14 years old and he was 22. They got married in 1976 and divorced in the same year. The couple gave marriage a second shot in 1996 after making up and having a daughter, but ended up splitting for a second time.\n\n7. Judge Judy\n\nTelevision\u2019s Judge Judy married Jerry Sheindlin for the first time in 1977, but they announced their divorce in 1990. It wasn\u2019t long until the couple rekindled their romance, and they walked down the aisle for a second time in 1991, with their marriage still going strong today.",

A raft of changes \u2013 seven to be exact \u2013 for the second-leg clash with Benfica left a portion of Liverpool fans slightly fearful about the prospect of a Benfica comeback, but the Reds\u2019 first-leg domination saved their bacon after an end-to-end Anfield encounter.\n\nRoberto Firmino\u2019s brace and Ibrahima Konate\u2019s header cancelled out strikes from Goncalo Ramos, Roman Yaremchuk and the in-demand Darwin Nunez in a 3-3 thriller, with the latter also seeing two further strikes ruled out for offside as Liverpool set up a semi-final showdown with giant killers Villarreal.\n\nNever before have Liverpool managed to reach the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, FA Cup and Champions League in one season, and aspirations of a remarkable quadruple are very much still a possibility, even though they will be relying on Man City dropping points to have a shot at Premier League glory.\n\nThe Reds have knocked Shrewsbury Town, Cardiff City, Norwich City and Nottingham Forest out of the tournament to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since 2014-15 \u2013 before Klopp had arrived \u2013 and they have made the final on eight of the last 10 occasions that they have reached the final four. The draw with Benfica marked a seventh game without defeat in all competitions for the Reds \u2013 who have found the back of the net at least twice in six of those games \u2013 but they have now gone five games without a win versus Man City after the Etihad spectacular earlier this month.\n\nCity and Liverpool have not been familiar foes in the FA Cup down the years, with the most recent meeting between the two clubs in the competition coming all the way back in 2002-03, where Danny Murphy\u2019s penalty propelled the Reds to victory in the third round.\n\nMeanwhile, Klopp said he wanted to see improvements from his team, even though they came away from the Etihad with a point after a breathless match.\n\n\u201cCity were really strong last week and we were not at our best so I would like to see a game where we are at our best as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be interesting, so let\u2019s give it a try.\u201d\n\nThe draw kept Liverpool in the hunt for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies after they won the League Cup earlier in the season.\n\n\u201cIt has to be treated like a final, we have to,\u201d said the German. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is pretty much and that\u2019s how we approached it already since January since we started this little mission. You have to go all-in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWembley\u2019s a big pitch so we have to cover a lot of grass and to run a lot and to close big gaps but I think it will be cool. Of course, both teams will use the last game for analysis and we\u2019ll see who uses it better.\u201d Liverpool have won the FA Cup seven times in their illustrious history but they have never come this far under Klopp, who became manager at Anfield in 2015.\n\n\u201cMassive competition, massive competition,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously so far we didn\u2019t even go to the semis yet, so it\u2019s the first experience in the semi-finals at Wembley \u2013 but better late than never. Now we are there and it means everything to us, to be honest.\u201d",

He is yet to resign a week after his declaration.\n\nThere are also speculations about the presidential ambitions of Labour and Productivity Minister Chris Nigige and Niger Delta Affairs Minister Godswill Akpabio as well as the governorship aspirations of Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister Abubakar Malami and Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba.\n\n\u201cThe position of the party is consistent with the Electoral Act. We are allowing our affected members who may have the intention of contesting the primaries to comply with the Electoral Act as provided,\u201d Morka said yesterday.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe party will simply follow the Electoral Act. Any member of the party who is in an appointive position, we will expect such individual to resign before our primaries.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that they will comply at the right time and we are going to ensure that anyone seeking our ticket will not breach the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nAsked how soon those appointees were expected to turn in their letters, Morka said: \u201cThe Electoral Act however does not stipulate the time frame by which individuals should resign their appointments before the primary. But we shall ensure the party complies with the law.\u201d\n\nIn signing the Electoral Act last month, President Muhammadu Buhari said Section 84 (12) was in conflict with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution and asked the National Assembly to amend the Act appropriately.\n\nHe followed it up with a letter to the two chambers of the National Assembly to do the needful.\n\nThe legislators, however, declined to do the President\u2019s bidding and have even gone to court to appeal against the ruling of a Federal High Court, Umuahia, which recently voided the controversial section and asked the Attorney General of the Federation to expunge it from the Act.\n\nThe issue of resignation of political appointees is expected to be discussed during the maiden post- convention of the APC scheduled for Abuja on Wednesday, April 20.\n\nThe party, in the notice of the meeting, said: \u201cPursuant to Article 25.2.ii of the Constitution of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the National Working Committee (NWC) hereby invites members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of our great party to a meeting to consider the Party\u2019s Timetable/Schedule of Activities for Primaries for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 General Elections and other relevant business of the Party.\n\n\u201cAll members of the NEC are by this invitation to take notice of the meeting in accordance with Article 12.3 of the APC Constitution, please,\u201d the official notice/invitation for the NEC meeting stated.",

With four of his children hacked down by gunmen who invaded Kukawa village, Kanam Local Government area of Plateau State on Sunday morning, he remains inconsolable.\n\nSix other relations of his were also killed in the massacre which left about 106 residents of 10 communities in Kanam and Wase Local Government areas dead. About 70 others were injured while 100 houses were razed.\n\nPerhaps more devastating to Ali is the gory sight of the stream of blood resulting from the attack and the mass burial of the victims.\n\n\u201cI am yet to recover from the gory sight of this attack. It is painful to see my loved ones being lowered into a mass grave,\u201d he said, shaking his head and biting his lips.\n\n\u201cSome were butchered like goats.

But lost to the attack were his cousin and houses belonging to his relations.\n\nHis house is now like a refugee camp, offering accommodation to about 20 villagers who were rendered homeless by the invaders.\n\nSix days after the attack, much of the state was yet to recover from the shock yesterday.\n\nGovernor Simon Lalong of Plateau State said his heart was heavy.\n\nHe vowed to improve security at the state\u2019s borders, following incessant attacks in some communities in Kanam, Wase and Bassa local government areas .\n\nThe governor spoke during an interactive session with key stakeholders and community members of Kanam Local Government Area in Dengi.\n\nEfforts, he said, were being made to deploy security agencies to forestall further attacks in the area.\n\n\u201cKanam shares border with Taraba and Bauchi states and there is a need to address its porous nature through improved security at the borders,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe decision to improve security at the borders is not only exclusive to Plateau but a resolution by the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum to address insecurity in the region.\n\n\u201cWe will do all our best because it is our primary responsibility to protect lives.\n\n\u201cThose who committed this heinous crime may think that they have escaped, but I can assure you that we will never allow them to go free, no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cI am sure that God will also not allow them to go unpunished for taking the precious lives of others without reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came here with a heavy heart and with all heads of security agencies to comfort you.\u201d\n\nHe urged the people not to take the law into their hands through reprisals, but cooperate with security agencies by giving them information that would to enable them to discharge their duties effectively.\n\nThe governor assured the people that the state was working with the Federal Government to find a lasting solution to insecurity on the Plateau, the North Central and the entire North.\n\nHe said he had already briefed President Muhammadu Buhari and appealed for a coordinated approach to tackling terrorists\u2019 attacks in the North Central, particularly at border areas and ungoverned spaces which have become operational bases for the terrorists who criss-cross communities, causing damage to lives and property.\n\nKanam LG Chairman, Dayyabu Garga, said 106 people were buried in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nHe said that the area was becoming a hideout for bandits and the development was affecting the source of livelihood of his people who are mostly peasant farmers.\n\nGarga called for deployment of more security personnel in the area to protect lives and appealed for the provision of relief materials.\n\nAlso speaking at the interface, the President of Jhar Development Association, Mr Amos Gizo, called for construction of access roads in the area to facilitate quick response to distress calls.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor earlier paid a courtesy visit to the Emir of Kanam, Alhaji Mu\u2019azu Muhammad II, and also visited the injured at Dengi General Hospital.\n\nAlso at the meeting was Representative Yusuf Gagdi (Pankshin, Kanke, Kanam).\n\nRep: Nigerians should be allowed to carry arms for self defence\n\nSpeaking to reporters after visiting the scenes of the attacks yesterday, Gagdi asked the National Assembly to enact laws permitting Nigerians to bear arms for the purpose of defending themselves.\n\nGagdi, who is the House Committee Chairman on Navy, said legalising arms bearing would go a long way in addressing the recurring attacks and killings in some parts of the country.\n\nHis words: \u201dIf we want to curtail the spate of attacks, we should make laws that will permit citizens to carry arms.\n\n\u201dIf, for instance, those who attacked my people knew that the locals also had arms, they would not have come; and even if they came, the casualties would not be this high.\n\n\u201cBut there must be regulation of the use of the arms. Anyone who misuses it should be imprisoned or even sentenced to death by hanging.\n\n\u201dBut I tell you, if citizens are allowed to carry arms to protect themselves, all these attacks and killings will end.\u201d\n\nHow it all started, by Kanam LG chair\n\nGiving a vivid account of the coordinated attack, Garga said that early in the morning of Sunday, about 210 armed bandits stormed Kukawa, Gyambau, Kyaram, Dungur and Shuwaka on motorcycles. There were about 70 motorcycles each of which carried three persons.\n\nThe bandits went into action immediately, shooting residents on sight and setting houses ablaze.\n\nThirty-six people were killed in Kukawa, 24 in Jambau, eight in Kyaram and 10 in Wanka.\n\nSome other people were killed in the bush.\n\nSurvivors, however, disputed the casualty figure given by the council chairman. A member of the vigilance group in the LGA, Salisu Musa, said no fewer than 250 people were killed.\n\n\u201cThe people killed could not have been fewer than 250. I participated in the rescue operation and we collected more than 200 bodies by the time I got tired and withdrew,\u201d he said.\n\nIsmail Isa said the attack lasted about five hours, from 10 am to 3 pm, when security agents got to the scene and the bandits fled.\n\nThe gunmen were shooting and cutting down people with machetes all at the same time, he said.\n\n\u201cThose who were running were shot down and then butchered with machetes. Houses, shops and foodstuffs were set on fire. We don\u2019t know what we have done.\n\n\u201cThey moved from one village to the other.\n\n\u201cI cannot tell how I escaped the attack. They came when we were sitting under a tree. Some of the people we sat with were killed.\n\n\u201cI lost four people from my house and my house was burnt down completely with everything I had. I don\u2019t know from where I will start life afresh.\u201d\n\nThe invaders, according to Garga, came from Kamabari Forest in neighbouring Taraba State and said they had to be smoked out by all means.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must flush them out of the forest. They want to turn the forest into another Sambisa. If they are not flushed out, we will not be safe.\u201d\n\nThe Emir of Kanam, Alhaji Muhammad Muazu Muhammad II, expressed regret over the incident that claimed the lives of his people and called for the adoption of more proactive measures in the security operations of the country.",

          "title": "Tanko Yakasai: How Buhari\u2019s govt can stop insecurity",
          "text": "Alhaji Tanko Yakasai is an elder statesman and Second Republic politician. The nonagenarian, who was then President Shehu Shagari\u2019s Political Adviser, in this interview with Saturday Sun, insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration lacks the competence and capacity to end the present insecurity bedevilling the land, even as he lamented that the problems that gave birth to NEPU and ushered in the Sawaba Declaration of the 50s were still prevalent in today\u2019s Nigeria today. He spoke to DESMOND MGBOH in Kano.\n\nYour son, Salihu, just defected from the APC to the PRP. In his remarks, he made strong reference to the Sawaba Declaration. As a founding member of NEPU and a key signatory to the SAWABA declaration, how do you feel that the new generation of politicians are moving back to NEPU and the PRP?\n\nWell, it is inevitable because the conditions that led to the creation of NEPU and PRP and the rest of them are still there or are coming back all over again. When NEPU was founded, the slogan was emancipation and that was Sawaba. There were too much problems in the society at that time and the people were looking for reprieve. And some people thought of establishing a political party that would fight for that reprieve. And the purpose was to liberate the common people of the region from the oppression, poverty and lack of clear direction for the future occasioned by their leaders. So that was what brought about NEPU then. But unfortunately, because of military coup, all the political parties were banned, NEPU among them. But after about 13 years, when the ban on politics and political activities were lifted, some people went back to the issue of NEPU, went back to revive it and luckily for them, at that time, the leader of NEPU had some issues with the National Movement and he left. They got him as a rallying point and he helped them revive the agitation for the liberation and emancipation of the people of the region. As a result of that, they created a new political party, Peoples Redemption Party. So redemption and emancipation and liberation are the same thing. So, I am not surprised that today, the old belief is coming back again and there are a couple of very credible names that are associated with the PRP, because honestly speaking the problems that were prevalent then have not been solved and the need for a stronger push for liberation in the society is still as evident as it was in the past.\n\nDoes the PRP have the prospect of coming back to seize control of the politics of some parts of North, like Kano and Kaduna State, places where they were very popular in the Second Republic?\n\nYes I do see their chances because as far as I am concerned, they are still popular in all those areas that you just mentioned. This is because the changes that have happened in the lives of the people in those areas are not significant or any much different from what they were in past. The people of these states and region are still waiting for emancipation and the people are thinking randomly, let us go back to the original struggle for the emancipation of our people.\n\nFormer Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has just defected from the PDP to his NNPP. What is your take about this defection?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know and I never discussed with him about his motivations, but I guess that he is virtually looking for an opportunity, to use his influence in Kano and support somebody to emerge as the Governor of Kano State. I think he is not too keen on his own candidature as he is on winning the election in Kano State. I think he is looking for a platform where he can sponsor somebody with the support that he has here in Kano to emerge as the governor of the state. He would certainly make a huge difference if he is able to get somebody to be elected as a governor on his platform in Kano and a few states of Northern Nigeria.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAt the national level, what are his chances? We do know that he has a presidential aspiration. What are the chances his NNPP would make impact in 2023 elections?\n\nI think he is seeing the magnitude of the ambition to be elected the President of Nigeria, the costs, the reach out and the rest of them and probably, he thinks that time is not enough given that between now to the date of the election is a matter of months, certainly not years. And he must have worked out that time is not opportune for him to make an impact as a candidate for the Presidency. He would not come out and say it but I think that is not his motive. It is just like what Mallam Aminu Kano did. You see when Mallam realised that the National Movement could not provide him a platform for the Presidency, he decided to come back to Kano and eventually, he succeeded in forming the governments of Kano and Kaduna States. I think that this history is there in the psyche of Kwankwaso and I will not be surprised if he is not trying to repeat history.\n\nLooking at his rivals in Kano State- Ganduje in APC and Ibrahim Shekarau- a man that has blind political followership, what are his chances of using this new party to produce the next governor of the state?\n\nIf you look at the situation, I don\u2019t think there is a single leader among the three of them who is sure of getting the votes in Kano to produce the governor. But this is an electoral system whereby out of the three or four or five candidates, whoever emerges with the largest number of votes can be elected as the governor. You don\u2019t have to have all the votes to yourself before you become or you will be declared the winner and the governor of the state. You can win the election with a few thousand votes difference; you don\u2019t have to have an overwhelming majority over everybody. You can even win by just one vote. If you understand it this way, you will see his reasoning\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the insecurity in different parts of the country, but which is much more in the North. How do you feel about the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna terror attack, which occurred a few days after we had the airport attack in the same Kaduna?\n\nWell, this incident is most unfortunate and I want to extend my sincere sympathies to the families of the deceased. I also want to empathise with those who were injured and I am praying for those who are presently in hostage to regain their freedom soonest. You see, this problem is a national problem and we need a national government with social and military programmes to address properly the issue of insecurity and other problems in the land. This is because insecurity is largely associated with poverty and unemployment. To solve the problem of insecurity in Nigeria, you have to tackle the problem of unemployment in the country and then, poverty. Because those who are engaged to undermine security in Nigeria are largely people who do not have jobs or any serious thing that they are doing. To resolve this problem of insecurity, you have to come up with a policy programme that would not address one problem, but would address a number of interrelated problems, to address inter \u2013 related social problems that are driving insecurity.\n\nBut honestly speaking do you think President Buhari and his security apparatus in Nigeria can tackle the problem of insecurity in the country?\n\nYou know my position on this, right from the world go. You know my position about the President. By the time he was to contest for the position, I did not support him. I said that I did not support him to some journalists in the past and they asked me why. And I said that he has no capacity and competence to tackle the problem. And seven years is gone, the problem of insecurity in Nigeria has not been tackled or addressed. It has gone worse from where we are\n\nHow do you say that a retired General cannot tackle insecurity?\n\nYou cannot change somebody. This man joined the military when he was about 20 years old and now he is 80. You cannot change him. Look at during Obasanjo, when there was problem at Zaki Ibiam and one other area, what did he do? He ordered the military to move in. That is to tell you that you don\u2019t change people simply because he dropped the khaki and picked up an agbada. You don\u2019t change people. Until the end of his life, he would think in a military way.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAre you saying that it is not all about military force?\n\nWhat people with the right capacity do is that they look for people with great ideas from different vocations, regardless of whether they are from their party or not, and then tell them the problems worrying you. You urge them to think and come out with the solution to enable you tackle the problem. And when they put their heads together, they would come up with a number of recommendations out of which you can pick those that could be handled immediately. And in a matter of one year or so, you will begin to see a difference. This is the reason why when you are in politics and when you are in government, you make out your priority. Priority is the thing that requires your immediate attention and can be immediately addressed while you address others in the future.\n\nA lot of analysts believe that part of the problems of security in Northern Nigeria is the open international borders of the region. Quite a number of the terrorists are people from outside our borders. Let me have your honest take on this .\n\nOpen borders is not the major problem. The major problem, I told you, is when you produce millions of young people without anything for them to do to take care of themselves. This is the problem. Massive unemployment in the country, no education and even those who are educated are half- baked. You can\u2019t call them educated people. Yes they can read and right, but you know that they are not educated. So this problem of some people moving from outside the borders is a problem, but it is not the main problem. The major problem in this country is with the people of this country and it is because the younger generations that are coming up have no hope in the country and have no one to care for their needs. I mean they would like to get married, they would like to stay with their families and they would like to have prospects. But there is no hope in Nigeria. And when somebody has no hope, he takes to criminality to ease out his frustration. Because killing people does not solve their problems. This insurgency that they are doing, does it solve their problems? No! They go and kill people and steal their money and they would spend it on useless things. They don\u2019t use the money they receive from banditry and others for any useful thing. It is so frustrating. So you need to have experts. In fact I will advise that whoever would emerge as the next President should not limit himself to Nigeria or to Africa. He should look wider and further for assistance by way of ideas to solve the problems of insecurity and they would come to his help\n\nThere are arguments that there must be those who are benefiting from within as a result of which this insecurity problem has remained unsolvable. What would say to this?\n\nWell, If you remember the Late Chief of Defence Staff, Barde. When he died, he left billions of naira. How did he get all that money? He would go to President Jonathan and outline the solutions to the problem, and that this was how much it would cost, and Jonathan would direct that he should be given the money and when he got the money, he would take it for himself. This is what happened. Otherwise, how could he have got all those billions of naira? And he is not himself alone. There are many, many people like that in the system. There are many Bardes who are making their own money under the guise of fighting insecurity and insurgency in the country. This is one of the reasons we are not solving the problem because the monies that are allocated to solve the problem, they are not all being used to tackle the problem.\n\nYou have been an advocate of the emergence of a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction. Has your position changed about the Igbo Presidency?\n\nI said that I am in support of a President of Igbo extraction for Nigeria. But I made it clear at the time, nobody can gift you the Presidency in a democracy. Igbo people would have to go out in a country like Nigeria, with millions of people, you have to reach out to the left, right and centre. You have to not only reach out to people, but present them with a programme that would take care of your interests and their interests. It is not only about your own interests but also about their own interests. If their interests are not incorporated in your own programme, they would not support you. So the question of reaching out with a viable programme that would address the problems of different segments of the Nigeria society is a must. And that is what will begin to appeal to them, that if this man would get to power, our problems would be solved. If not all but partly. Without that, you can shout at the top of your voice about the Presidency, and nothing would change.\n\nFrom your assessment of those Igbo who have indicated interest in the Presidency, do you think that they have been reaching out enough?\n\nWell, my trouble is how many months now do we have left to the elections and what are the platforms that they are using to pursue their quest?.Because the most important thing is the platform. If the platform is nationwide in character, there is hope. But if the platform is not nationwide, if it is limited to your locality, there is no way, there is no magic that anybody can make to make you win the elections.\n\nBut do you see them making enough efforts to get the nod of the players on the big platforms\n\nHonestly their approach to addressing this problem is a challenge to me. Instead of trying to get very good platforms, they tend to create mushroom organisations that are limited to their own locality. I don\u2019t think that that is the way to go about it. You must launch yourselves into the Nigerian nation; seek out platforms that are national in character and take it up from there. This is because you need everybody. Without reaching out to all, there is no amount of shout that you make that would make you win the heart of people. Let them look for a viable platform, join it, make an impact. But as long as they are in APGA and the rest of them which are limited to Igbo land, they cannot give an Igbo man a platform to be elected as the President of Nigeria.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the last APC Convention which produced mostly consensus candidates?\n\nConsensus is not democracy. Nobody would tell you that democracy means consensus. No! Democracy means majority. So, consensus was not there before. It was not a platform that was to take anyone to power. I saw it, it happened. The President said that they could not afford the competition and contest as a party. In my opinion, if they had allowed true democracy to go ahead, the same outcome could have been arrived at. Adamu would have emerged the winner through a democratic process. I was telling somebody yesterday, when Ambode was not towing the lines of the party in Lagos State and they decided to remove him , what did Tinubu do? They had caucuses all over the place and they held a meeting and they spoke freely. Tinubu didn\u2019t utter a word and from their remarks, you would know that they were against Ambode and when the votes were cast, they rejected him and looked for another candidate.\n\nThere is a general feeling that the APC would pay dearly for the use of consensus arrangement because many of their members are not happy the way things went. Do you see this things playing out this way?\n\nIn any case, I told you that consensus negates democracy and what is known to democracy is majority votes. You know that those who withdrew didn\u2019t withdraw voluntarily. They withdrew to submit to bigger power because, as you know, from now to the end of his tenure there are a lot of things that Buhari can do. And most of these aspirants were former governors who have some problems and he has his own information about everybody and everybody knows that he has that information. The moment you attempt to revolts, all he needs to do is to keep you quiet and let you go but then in the next few days, you will be in trouble with the authorities and this is the reason they conceded against their wish. They know. They were former officials who have skeletons in their cupboards and can\u2019t afford to disobey the Presidential directive.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank in its latest Africa\u2019s Pulse, a biannual analysis of the near-term regional macroeconomic outlook, has projected a 2.7% growth for Nigeria in 2022.\n\nOf the region\u2019s three largest economies \u2013 Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa \u2013 only Nigeria is projected to enjoy a fairly good growth in 2022.\n\n\n\nThe report said growth in South Africa is expected to decline by 2.8 percentage points in 2022, dragged by persistent structural constraints.\n\n\n\nAngola is projected to continue its growth in 2022, but at just 0.2 per cent.\n\n\u201cAngola and Nigeria are expected to continue their growth momentum in 2022, up by 2.7 and 0.2 percentage points respectively, in part due to elevated oil prices and good performance in the non-oil sector.\n\nResource-rich countries, especially their extractive sectors, will see improved economic performance due to the war in Ukraine, while non-resource rich countries will experience a deceleration in economic activity,\u201d said the World Bank.\n\n\n\nIn the report, the World Bank, estimates growth in Sub-Saharan Africa at 3.6 per cent in 2022, down from 4 per cent in 2021, as the region continues to deal with new COVID-19 variants, global inflation, supply disruptions and climate shocks.\n\n\n\nThe bank explained that recovery remained uneven, incomplete and was happening at varied rates of speed across the region.\n\nIt said this was due in part to elevated oil prices and good performance in the non-oil sector.\n\nIt said: Excluding Angola, Nigeria and South Africa, regional growth is projected at 4.1 per cent in 2022, and 4.9 per cent in 2023. The Eastern and Southern Africa sub-region shows sustained recovery from the recession, at 4.1 per cent in 2021, down to 3.1 per cent in 2022 and settling around 3.8 per cent in 2024.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe region\u2019s growth challenges, the World Bank report said, are rising global commodity prices, which are increasing at a faster pace since the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIt pointed out that as top world exporters of food staples \u2013 Russia and Ukraine \u2013 for a substantial share of wheat, corn and seed oil imports, all of which may be halted if the conflict persists.\n\n\n\nWhile Sub-Saharan economies are also likely to be impacted by tightening of global conditions and reduced foreign financial flows into the region, the analysis notes that the high fuel and food prices will translate into higher inflation across African countries, hurting poor and vulnerable citizens, especially those living in urban areas.\n\n\n\nThe bank cited one point of concern as the increased likelihood of civil strife as a result of food and energy-fueled inflation, particularly in the current environment of heightened political instability.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs African countries face continued uncertainty, supply disruptions and soaring food and fertilizer prices, trade policy can potentially play a key role by ensuring the free flow of food across borders throughout the region. Amid limited fiscal space, policymakers must look to innovative solutions such as reducing or waiving import duties on staple foods temporarily to provide relief to their citizens,\u201d said World Bank Chief Economist for Africa, Albert Zeufack.\n\n\n\nThe report highlighted the importance of expanding social protection programmes beyond safety nets to strengthen economic resilience and responsiveness to shocks, particularly for poor and vulnerable households.\n\nRecommendations include developing social insurance, savings and labour market programmes that contribute to economic resilience by protecting urban informal workers and help the population invest in their health and education.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Relatives: We will resist resumption of train services without rescuing our loved ones\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe 68 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of an Abuja-Kaduna train are today 20 days old in the dungeon of the terrorists, with families and friends accusing the federal government and security agencies of not doing anything tangible to free them.\n\n\n\nYesterday, some relations of the abductees based in Kaduna State threatened to resist any attempt by the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to resume the Abuja-Kaduna train services without rescuing their loved ones.\n\nThe terror attack also left eight persons dead at the scene, two others died in the hospital from gunshot injuries sustained, and with several others still nursing their wounds in hospital.\n\n\n\nThe terrorists had few days ago released a two-minute video, showing scores of abductees sitting in a forest, including men, women and children. Behind them was a group of gunmen standing in a line.\n\n\n\nOne of the abductees said in Hausa: \u201cIt is only us that know the dire situation we are in, there are women and children here; there are aged people with health challenges.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the terrorists said the government knew what they wanted, threatening to kill those in custody if their demands were not met.\n\n\n\nThe video clearly showed the abductees in anguish. Some of them are believed to be carrying bullet wounds. They are being traumatised in a forest, amid mosquitos, hash conditions and many other dangers.\n\n\n\nThere is also a pregnant woman and some children with the terrorists in the very harsh environment.\n\nSources said the abductees were made to trek for five days, resting intermittently in transit camps, before they arrived at the main camp of the attackers around Shiroro Local Government Area in Niger State.\n\n\n\nThe released Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, BOA, Alwan Hassan, while recounting his ordeal a few days back, said 41 women, 22 men, 5 kids were with the terrorists.\n\n\n\nThe federal government had assured that it would do everything necessary to ensure the release of those still being held hostage but families and friends of the victims said they had not seen anything concrete being done in this direction.\n\n\n\nThe families, who said the federal government and security agencies had not deemed it fit to get in touch with them, are pleading with the terrorists to allow them negotiate the release of their relations.\n\n\n\nOne of the abducted family members, Aliyu Mohammed, who spoke in Abuja last Thursday, begged the terrorists to give room for families to negotiate the release of their loved ones.\n\n\n\nMohammed said: \u201cIt is the families, and not the government, that will bear the brunt should anything untoward happen to the abductees.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso last week, some of the victims\u2019 families staged a peaceful protest at the Radio House in Abuja, with placards appealing to the federal government to do more in ensuring that they are released.\n\n\n\nAliyu Mahmud, a relative of a seven-month pregnant woman, had said: \u201cI have my sister who is seven months pregnant with her husband. Words cannot explain what they are going through and what we are going through. Please, the government should do the needful and let this come to an end as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey should try as much as possible to reach out to the perpetrators and rescue our loved ones. There are children there, pregnant women, the sick, the aged and only God knows what they are going through.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhatever we do, we think of them. When we eat, we think of them. When we sleep, anything we do, we think of them. We are pleading with the government to please do the needful so that this situation will come to an end as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother protester, Aminu Uthman, said: \u201cMy immediate younger brother and his wife are among the victims. It is a nightmare and the most difficult days I have had in my life. I cannot sleep or eat. A lot of things are going wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bandits called only once and they gave him the phone to speak to us. They are yet to make any request but they called to say he is with them. We voted for this government because of insecurity. We had the trust that they would address insecurity. This protest is not for the family members alone; it is for Nigerians generally. This thing can happen to anybody.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome other relatives of the kidnapped victims also met in Kaduna early in the week and accused the federal government of insensitivity towards the plight of the abductees.\n\n\n\nDr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, who led and spoke on behalf of the kidnapped relatives, said they were yet to establish contact with their loved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident on March 28, 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is better for the government to go into negotiation with the terrorists as they have demanded to secure the release of our loved ones alive.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Transportation are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it. Until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening a channel of communication with them (terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done everywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven the US, Israel and the most powerful nations of the world, do negotiate when they have issues like this to preserve the lives of their citizens. This, we know our government can do and we are appealing to them to do it. We don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens. Life is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the Nigerian government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do. We are appealing to them to come out to open a channel of discussion with the bandits and get our loved ones out as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been in serious anguish in the past 15 days. Many of us have not been sleeping, we have not been sleeping. We are like living corpses.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo fewer than 362 passengers were onboard the train at the time terrorists struck on March 28.\n\nFamilies: We Will Resist Resumption of Train Services without Rescuing Our Loved Ones\n\n\n\nFamilies of some abductees on the Abuja-Kaduna train yesterday warned that they would resist any attempt to resume services on the route without rescuing their loved ones.\n\n\n\nThey also lashed at the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi for declaring for president days after the train attack, saying he was insensitive to the plight of the people and should resign.\n\n\n\nThe relations had earlier on Tuesday issued a 72 hour ultimatum to the federal government to ensure the release of the victims or be allowed to negotiate with the terrorists.\n\nAddressing a news conference yesterday in Kaduna, leader of the families of the kidnapped victims, Dr. Abdulfatai Jimoh\n\n\n\nsaid after the expiration of the 72-hour-ultimatum, the federal government informed Nigerians that it started discussing with the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHe appealed to the government to speed up the negotiations, saying the families of the victims had been in trauma since the incident and urged the government to act fast.\n\nJimoh warned the NRC against the proposed resumption of train services without first rescuing the kidnapped victims.\n\n\n\nHe warned that the families of the abducted persons would not take it lightly with the NRC if they go ahead to resume operations when their relations are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cBecause human lives are involved, we believe they will not do that. We believe they won\u2019t because they know what is at stake,\u201dJimoh said.\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, Fatima Ciroma, whose sister is among those in captivity called for the resignation of Amaechi.\n\nDr. Abdulkarim Atta, who also has two captives with the terrorists, said they had contacted him 11 times, telling him that \u201cthey have their targets\u201d in the in ill-fated train.\n\n\n\nHe added that the terrorist told him that it was unfortunate that other people were taken away by them.\n\nAtta, whose 85 year old mother and sister are among those kidnapped, explained that he was given the opportunity by the bandits to talk to his aged mother and sister before the release of the Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Ali-Hassan.\n\n\n\nHe said further that in the course of his discussions with them during the phone call, the terrorists told him that the state governor, (Nasir El-Rufai) had been running his mouth and that was why they came to his doorstep.\n\nAccording to Atta, the terrorists said the train attack was just the beginning and that they would go further than this.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Stella Oduah, a Nigerian Senator and former Minister of Aviation has finalised her defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\n\n\nOduah on August 27, 2021, left the PDP for the APC.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the Senator returned to the PDP and secretly obtained the party\u2019s nomination form to return to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenator Stella Oduah has finally dumped the APC and moved to the PDP after days of playing hide and seek game. Having used Abubakar Malami, the AGF to frustrate and hang her trial and prosecution at the Federal High Court, Abuja before Justice Inyang Ekwo on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and siphoning of N7.9 billion when she was the Minister of Aviation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 reported that the former aviation minister had concluded plans to dump the ruling APC for the PDP.\n\nSee Also Politics After Tricking Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami To Frustrate N7.9bn Fraud Trial, Stella Oduah Moves To Dump APC For PDP\n\nSaharaReporters reported that the Senator had held a closed-door meeting with Anyim Pius Anyim, a PDP presidential aspirant and some party leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe used Senator Anyim to reach out and perfected her new arrangement and agreement with the PDP leadership preparatory to her decampment to PDP in the next few days,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\nThe move came a few days after Malami orchestrated different strategies to compromise and frustrate the prosecution of Oduah, who has corruption cases hanging on her neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trio of Abubakar Malami, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator Ahmad Lawan are feeling used and dumped by Stella Oduah, having been briefed and realised that she has used them to frustrate her prosecution and betrayed their 'agreement' and 'accord' by finalising arrangements to dump APC for PDP in the next few days,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSee Also Scandal How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami Frustrated N7.9bn Fraud Trial Of Stella Oduah After Ex-Aviation Minister Joined Ruling APC\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively reported in 2021 that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N7.9 billion fraud might be scuttled going by her secret plot with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Malami.\n\n\n\nHowever, SaharaReporters learnt on Friday that Oduah had reached out to PDP members in her zone and her town in Ogbaru Local Government Area to secure the PDP Senatorial nomination form for Anambra North zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the form secretly so that the office of AGF, Abubakar Malami and also the national leadership of APC will not know that she has used them to stall and frustrate her trial before Justice Ekwo, then having achieved her aim, she has finally used and dumped them,\u201d another source confirmed to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201clt is most disturbing and disheartening that 3 years after the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) concluded its investigation into the case of diversion of N7.9 billion fraud and embezzlement of public funds perpetrated by Stella Oduah, she is still evading trial and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has been summoned to enter the witness box and take her plea about five times so that the trial can commence, but Malami and Governor Mai Mala Buni (Yobe governor and former chairman of the APC caretaker committee) shielded her from justice and the long arm of the law by frustrating the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same Stella Oduah has now run back to the PDP and obtained PDP nomination form.\u201d\n\nOduah is being prosecuted on

Having used Abubakar Malami, the AGF to frustrate and hang her trial and prosecution at the Federal High Court, Abuja before Justice Inyang Ekwo on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and siphoning of N7.9 billion when she was the Minister of Aviation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters on Tuesday, March 29, 2022 reported that the former aviation minister had concluded plans to dump the ruling APC for the PDP.\n\nSee Also Politics After Tricking Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami To Frustrate N7.9bn Fraud Trial, Stella Oduah Moves To Dump APC For PDP\n\nSaharaReporters reported that the Senator had held a closed-door meeting with Anyim Pius Anyim, a PDP presidential aspirant and some party leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe used Senator Anyim to reach out and perfected her new arrangement and agreement with the PDP leadership preparatory to her decampment to PDP in the next few days,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\n\nThe move came a few days after Malami orchestrated different strategies to compromise and frustrate the prosecution of Oduah, who has corruption cases hanging on her neck.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trio of Abubakar Malami, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator Ahmad Lawan are feeling used and dumped by Stella Oduah, having been briefed and realised that she has used them to frustrate her prosecution and betrayed their 'agreement' and 'accord' by finalising arrangements to dump APC for PDP in the next few days,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSee Also Scandal How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Malami Frustrated N7.9bn Fraud Trial Of Stella Oduah After Ex-Aviation Minister Joined Ruling APC\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively reported in 2021 that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N7.9 billion fraud might be scuttled going by her secret plot with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Malami.\n\n\n\nHowever, SaharaReporters learnt on Friday that Oduah had reached out to PDP members in her zone and her town in Ogbaru Local Government Area to secure the PDP Senatorial nomination form for Anambra North zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the form secretly so that the office of AGF, Abubakar Malami and also the national leadership of APC will not know that she has used them to stall and frustrate her trial before Justice Ekwo, then having achieved her aim, she has finally used and dumped them,\u201d another source confirmed to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201clt is most disturbing and disheartening that 3 years after the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) concluded its investigation into the case of diversion of N7.9 billion fraud and embezzlement of public funds perpetrated by Stella Oduah, she is still evading trial and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe has been summoned to enter the witness box and take her plea about five times so that the trial can commence, but Malami and Governor Mai Mala Buni (Yobe governor and former chairman of the APC caretaker committee) shielded her from justice and the long arm of the law by frustrating the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same Stella Oduah has now run back to the PDP and obtained PDP nomination form.\u201d\n\nOduah is being prosecuted on 25 counts of money laundering alongside Gloria Odita, Nwobu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Limited, Crystal Television Limited, Sobora International Limited and the China Civil Engineering Construction Company Limited.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the arraignment of the Senator was aborted at the Federal High Court in Abuja during the last adjourned

          "text": "Some operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission have expressed their disappointment after the Nigerian Government pardoned former governors of Plateau State, Senator Joshua Dariye; and Taraba State, Rev Jolly Nyame.\n\nThe EFCC, according to a report by PUNCH, had spent hundreds of millions of naira on investigations and prosecution of the pardoned former governors between 2007 and 2018.\n\n\n\nDariye\u2019s case was said to have cost a lot more as it emanated from London and the star witness, Peter Clark, who was a policeman, had to be flown from the United Kingdom on several occasions and lodged in hotels while the case dragged on.\n\nThe Council of State on Thursday granted a state pardon to Dariye and Nyame, who were jailed for corruption.\n\n\n\nThe former governors along with 157 others will be released from prison after the Council of State approved a proposal by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government to grant them a state pardon.\n\nDariye and Nyame were imprisoned for stealing public funds to the tune of N1.16billion and N1.6billion respectively.\n\nNyame and Dariye were governors of their respective states from 1999 to 2007.\n\nAn EFCC operative told the newspaper that the detective, who handled Dariye\u2019s case, Ilyasu Kwarbai, was hit in the head with the butt of the gun by overzealous supporters of the ex-governor when the case was being handled in Jos.\n\nThe operative said, \u201cThe pardon for Dariye is demoralising. Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) was the one who handled the case. He has an internal arrangement with the EFCC so his fee is not that much. However, the bulk of the money was spent on investigation. The case started from London. We had to fly there and lodge in hotels.\n\n\u201cAlso, Peter Clark, a UK officer, was the star witness. He was the one who first arrested Dariye in 2004. We had to fly him here on several occasions to testify in Nigeria. Sometimes, when he arrived in Nigeria, the case would be adjourned for one flimsy reason or the other and he would have to travel back and then return to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cClark was the one who revealed how Dariye bought a pen for \u00a37,000 and was found with over \u00a340,000, while his aide had about \u00a350,000 on her. We spent hundreds of millions on this case. Kwarbai was attacked. The scar is still on his head. How will the UK take us seriously?\u201d\n\nReacting, Jacobs said he was disappointed in the decision of the Buhari regime.\n\nHe said the message being conveyed was that prison was only for the poor, noting that this would embolden the younger generation to embrace fraud.\n\nHe added that the pardon meant that both Dariye and Nyame could later run for elective offices.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis pardon means that they can hold offices and run for elections. It has turned the anti-corruption war into a joke. It is a setback against the fight against corruption.\n\n\u201cThey are setting a bad example for the younger generation. This case went from the High Court to the Supreme Court and now the convicts are being pardoned.\n\n\u201cIt will demoralise the judges, the investigators and the prosecutors. It sends a bad message to the youth and Nigerians as a whole.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

I hope you all see the emotions in his smiles,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAfter taking his pictures, Olashile realised he could do more for the man than just bring smiles to his face.\n\nHe decided to mint the man\u2019s photographs as a non-fungible token (NFT) on OpenSea and sold them for 0.3 Ethereum (Eth) each.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Forbes, \u201cAn NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.\u201d\n\nIn his earlier post, the corps member announced that he would be donating 50 percent of proceeds from the initiative to the man.\n\n\u201cMinted baba\u2019s pictures as nft and got them sold immediately. Inshallahu 50% is going to him. Ramadan Kareem,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a follow-up post on Friday, the photographer made good on his promise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe shared a video of himself giving the man the said percentage of the proceeds.\n\nOlashile further gave the man the sum of N100,000 donated to him after his photos went viral. The NFT creator also took the man to the bank to open an account for him.\n\n\u201cRemember Baba Onilu? This is the video of how I gave him 50% of the money made from his picture that minted as NFT on #opensea.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Julian Owusu\u2019s journey from football to fintech",
          "text": "\u201cPeople don\u2019t know me as a footballer anymore. I\u2019m no longer defined by the game. This, along with the fact that I can build products that real people are using, is a true mark of success.\u201d\n\nAt 14, UK-born Ghanaian Julian Owusu discovered a talent that would earn him money: playing football.\n\nIt\u2019s a dream many young boys have, to gain global recognition and wealth doing something they enjoy, a sport watched by over 1.1 billion people across the world. While football might not be one of the top 20 paying professions in the world, it is the fifth-highest paid sports profession, with pro players getting an average of $3.6 million yearly.\n\nEven though football held a promising future for Julian, it was only one of his dreams. \u201cI grew up playing football,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been interested in tech, even long before I started playing professionally.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his football career, Julian knew he wanted to tell a different story with his journey. \u201cMost of the other footballers I know have the same story, whether they were rich or poor. They don\u2019t know what else to do when they\u2019re not practising or playing. They don\u2019t know where or if they belong outside the field. I wanted to be different.\u201d\n\nHe started his professional journey at 16 when he joined Eleven Wise\u2014a Division One football league club based in Ghana\u2014as a striker. Julian had joined the club on the recommendation of his agent who thought he would benefit from the club\u2019s rigorous training. \u201cIt was actually my first solo trip to Ghana,\u201d he says. \u201cMy folks had brought me over every year, but coming down to join Eleven Wise was the first time I\u2019d be in Ghana on my own. And I think that trip is really what helped me build my entrepreneurial spirit.\u201d\n\nHe had to forget his UK background and immerse himself in Ghana\u2019s culture. \u201cI had to understand local cultures and become like my teammates. I had to understand what the fans wanted, and what my coaches wanted. So I learned a lot of lessons very quickly about becoming a professional and just having a professional mindset.\u201d\n\nUpon completion of his one-year contract with Eleven Wise, Julian moved to Berekum Chelsea, a premier league club out of Ghana, in 2010 where he helped the team score several goals including the 2010\u20132011 Ghana Premier League cup\u2014the youngest team ever to win the cup\u2014the MTN FA Cup, and the 2011 Ghana\u2019s President\u2019s Cup.\n\nFrom Berekum Chelsea, he glided through other clubs, from Hayes and Yeading United, to Burnham, right until 2014 when he decided to retire.\n\nWhen football players on defining paths, such as Julian, retire, it\u2019s often because of injury. Like in most contact sports, football players are exposed to more than their fair share of harm including muscle sprains and toe fractures.\n\nJulian\u2019s retirement, however, had nothing to do with injury, age, or scandal. He simply wanted to be more.\n\n\u201cI was on holiday one year, writing and thinking through what I wanted to become,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wondered what I wanted to be when I was in my 30s, 40s, 50s or 60s, and I realised that football wasn\u2019t the only thing I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nHe needed to build knowledge in an industry that could set him up for success, and so he decided to return to school, a transition he didn\u2019t find so difficult, he says. \u201cIt was difficult at the beginning, but all the skills I\u2019d learnt playing football were transferrable. I knew how to work hard. The only reason it was difficult at the start wasn\u2019t because I was studying. It was more because I wasn\u2019t training or going to play a match.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, enrolled at the London School of Business and Management, Julian got introduced to digital product management by executing the website for the New Student Union. But he didn\u2019t fall in love with the field until 2 years later when he landed a product management role at Landon and Fitch, a London-based advertising firm. \u201cIn my first role, I was only managing the teams and scope, and I wanted more. At Landon and Fitch, though, I got hands-on experience with building and ideating, and that\u2019s where everything clicked into place and I knew it was what I would continue doing. There\u2019s something beautiful about the process of taking something from an idea, bringing it to life and seeing real people use it.\u201d\n\nFrom his product management role at Landor & Fitch in 2018, Julian went on to manage other products at Culturetool and Spark44, right until he decided to build a product of his own: Zuberi Pay.\n\nThe idea for Zuberi came to Julian as he drove through the streets of London. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of building a fintech. I just wanted to tackle a problem every day people had. And when I thought about what problems 90% of people had, it was cash flow, money!\u201d\n\nWhile the product was officially released for beta-testing in January 2021, Zuberi started operation right around the time COVID went mainstream in February 2020. Julian added 10 workers to a WhatsApp group and explained his idea to them: Zuberi would provide them with salary advances, for a small interest fee.\n\nZuberi\u2019s app interface\n\nWithin a few months, the number of people who\u2019d joined the group doubled. He was providing 30 people with advances, using everyday tools like WhatsApp for communication, Excel for data collection, and Taptap Send to transfer payment. \u201cWhen I thought about how much I was doing just on WhatsApp and Excel, I realised that I could learn more and expand better with an app. So I started pitching to investors.\u201d\n\nMonths later, he\u2019d raised about \u00a322,000 ($28,700) from friends and family to build the first iteration of the Zuberi App. At that time, he also brought on as co-founder Nana Adomako\u2014who worked as the Growth Manager for Taptap Send.\n\nBy December 2021, Julian quit his 9\u20135 as a product manager and moved to Ghana to focus on and lead the vision of Zuberi. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a founder of a startup,\u201d he says, \u201cI think the best role is probably to be a product manager because you\u2019re basically the CEO of the product and you get to know the ins and outs of what you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nWhile Zuberi is still in its early stages and available to only a select group of users, it has thousands of Ghanaians on its waitlist. \u201cWe are still sorting out regulation and yet to fully launch. We\u2019re working with the Bank of Ghana to get Zuberi up as soon as possible so people can access its benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his fears, Julian says he has none, even though he\u2019s earning significantly less as a CEO, compared to when he was a footballer or a product manager. \u201cI think I could probably play again if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019ve found my calling. Here, I\u2019m building value, actual value I can see in people\u2019s lives. I might not be earning as much but I\u2019m not high-maintenance. As long as I can provide for my family, then that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Although eventful, it has been overwhelming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), I knew the first few days would be that way. But, it hasn\u2019t been easy! And honestly, I\u2019ve been looking forward to today.\n\nSo, aside from the fact that it\u2019s Good Friday, I must say that it will be a good one for me because I\u2019ll get plenty of rest and possibly watch some Netflix and chill.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m available for enjoyment this weekend! If you\u2019re interested, please get in touch with me. Nobody will know. \ud83d\ude05\n\nOkay, jokes apart, how was your week? I believe it was less stressful. If it wasn\u2019t, I think the weekend would be because it is a public holiday. \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0a So you have the entire day and weekend to rest and be taken care of.\n\nToday, being a good Good Friday, I\u2019ll be talking about the following:\n\nDriving financial inclusion with embedded finance\n\nUber\u2019s operation suspension in Tanzania\n\nOPay Egypt\u2019s preliminary approval\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Techpoint Africa is organising the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, where you can learn the basics of Web3 and discover how to build a career in Web3 and blockchain.\n\nThe Blockchain Summit will be held on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos.

I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria? Click on the link to find out.\n\nUber Tanzania suspends operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Thursday, April 14, 2022, ride-hailing company, Uber, suspended operations in Tanzania until further notice after six years in the country.\n\nUber announced the decision in a statement sent to customers across the country, noting that they will not operate in Tanzania until an agreement with the authorities is reached.\n\nWhy the suspension? Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services.

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nYesterday, I incorrectly stated that Flutterwave is Africa\u2019s most valuable company.\n\nBut per African Financials\u2019 March 2022 market report, South Africa\u2019s multinational telecommunications company, MTN Group, is the most valuable African company in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by market capitalisation.\n\nSome numbers: As of February 2022, MTN Group\u2019s market capitalisation was estimated at $24 billion, making it the most valuable brand in SSA. This is comparable to Flutterwave\u2019s $3 billion valuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlutterwave, on the other hand, is arguably Africa\u2019s most valuable startup. That was where I got it wrong. Please keep in mind that, at the time of writing, MTN Group is the most valuable African company, while Flutterwave is the most valuable African startup.\n\nMore importantly, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, is the one facing allegations, not Flutterwave.\n\nWe still need you on this: Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nAnyway, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFlutterwave CEO\u2019s insider trading allegation\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nIs Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, published an article in which he allegedly accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading.\n\nSince then, the phrase \u201cinsider trading\u201d has topped my Twitter trend tables. While I\u2019ve seen a variety of perspectives \u2013 some of which appear to be accurate and some false \u2013 the question on almost everyone\u2019s lips is, is insider trading a thing given that Flutterwave is a private, US-based startup?\n\nBefore you exercise your Googling skills, I\u2019d like to do my part to simplify things.\n\nFirst off, insider trading, according to Investopedia, is the purchase or sale of stock in a publicly-traded company by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSidebar: For proper understanding, nonpublic material information is corporate news or information about a company that has not been made public but has the potential to affect its stock price.\n\nFor example, suppose Chimgozirim learns about nonpublic material information from someone who works at ABC company and shares it with Bolu. If Chimgozirim\u2019s informant uses this insider information to profit in the stock market, all three involved are guilty and can be prosecuted.\n\nBesides, insider information is typically available to executives working within or near a public company.\n\nAccording to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), illegal insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence based on material, nonpublic information about the security.\n\nWhat does the law say about insider trading? Insider trading laws apply to private and public companies and transactions involving employees, employee stock plans, and third-party shareholders.\n\nSo, what is your verdict on the allegations against Agboola? Guilty? Or innocent?\n\nWhile I may not be able to delve into some of Hundeyin\u2019s allegations, today\u2019s podcast analysed the article to an extent, leaving us with many unanswered questions. You can listen to it here.\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu has worked on a piece to fact-check Hundeyin\u2019s story. And I believe it will add context to this. Please read it here: Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, since secondary school \u2013 if not primary school \u2013 some of us have heard the clause \u201cAgriculture is the mainstay of the national economy.\u201d And, of course, I mean the Nigerian economy.\n\nI also remember my secondary school Agricultural Science teachers repeatedly asking my class to discuss what that meant in both tests and exams at one point or another.\n\nSo, how about we talk about what this means for Africa? Do you want to give it a shot?\n\nI\u2019ll go then: Agriculture is the backbone of most African economies, and agricultural performance is inextricably linked to economic performance in these countries.\n\nTo give some context, studies have shown that agriculture is by far Africa\u2019s most important economic activity. It employs roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s working population and contributes an average of 30%-60% to each country\u2019s gross domestic product and approximately 30% of export value.\n\nI\u2019m not here to bore you, so this is my final point: Per a Mckinsey research, Agriculture has a massive social and economic impact in Africa. Smallholder farmers account for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population, and agriculture accounts for approximately 23% of the region\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegardless of my points, much of Africa\u2019s agricultural potential is still untapped. In 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry due to insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought.\n\nMoreover, according to the United Nations (UN), it is expected that Africa will be unable to feed 60% of its population by 2025. The African population, estimated at 118 million at the turn of the twentieth century, had risen to 788.5 million in 1997 and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025.\n\n1.5 billion people will go hungry by 2025? Omo X100! But what are we doing to change this narrative?\n\nAlthough food insecurity, climate change, and other agricultural issues persist on the continent, some startups are trying to address some of the sector\u2019s problems. And Katapult Africa, a venture capital firm, focuses on startups developing solutions for agriculture, food, and the environment.\n\nInteresting facts about the VC firm: The firm was founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad and has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly. Also, in 2018, the firm began investing in African startups, and it now has 17 startups in its portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not one to give spoilers. But I trust Chimgozirim to provide a detailed explanation of how Katapult invests.\n\nCheck out his insightful article here: An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUmba, a digital banking platform based in Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $15 million in Series A funding to expand into new markets like Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, where mobile money is popular.\n\nWho are the investors? Costanoa Ventures led the round. While firms like Nubank, a credit fintech platform, ACT Ventures, Lux Capital, Palm Drive Capital, Banana Capital, and Streamlined Ventures participated, individuals like Tom Blomfield, the co-founder of Monzo, and Lachy Groom also took part in the round.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup claims it offers transparent and readily available financial products to Africans who are underbanked or unbanked by legacy banks \u2013 locally owned and operated community banks.\n\nWhat is the startup\u2019s model?: Tiernan Kennedy (CEO) and Barry O\u2019Mahony (CFO) launched the company in 2018. And per TechCrunch, the company follows the credit-led model, first solving customers\u2019 liquidity problems before upselling them on a wide range of banking products.\n\nUmba says most of its revenue is generated by charging customers a monthly interest rate of 10%, which the CEO claims is the lowest rate in the market. But how true is this?\n\nTake Payhippo for example \u2013 an AI-powered lending platform that makes it easier to fund small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 claims its loan offering begins with short-term, affordable working capital delivered in 30\u201345 days at a 6% interest rate.\n\nHowever, since Umba\u2019s launch, the company claims it has doubled its revenues every three months, with over 1 million installs on Google Play.\n\nUnlike legacy banks, the company says that its core banking systems, which it designed from the ground up, prioritises customers. Consequently, in both the banking and mobile money markets, it offers customised user experience without delay.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Ade Coker, a director of Carbo Plc had received information that an investor with an astute brand influence planned to invest a huge amount into the company. He encouraged some shareholders of the company to sell their shares in the company as the company was on verge of bankruptcy. They sold their shares to him. Following the investment by the investor, the price of the company\u2019s shares witnessed a surge.\n\nWhat is insider trading?\n\nThe scenario above illustrates the concept of insider trading, a phenomenon that is not new to capital markets. Experts say it is one practice that has bedeviled the growth of the securities market in many countries.\n\nBlack\u2019s Law dictionary defines insider trading as the use of material, non-public information in trading the shares of a company by a corporate insider or other person who owes a fiduciary duty to the company.\n\nIn order to ensure fairness in market prices and maintain a level playing field for stakeholders and investors in the Nigerian securities market, Section 111 (1) of the Investment and Securities Act 2007 (ISA) and Rule 110 (e) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Rules 2013 (SEC Rules) prohibits insider trading.\n\nIt is the profitable trading in securities based on some confidential information or special knowledge that is unavailable to the general public that makes the practice unfair and illegal.\n\nWho is an insider?\n\nThe SEC Rules define an insider as any person who is connected with the company during the preceding six months as a director of the company or related company, an officer of the company, or a related company.\n\nIt also refers to an employee of the company or a related company, a person in a position, involving a professional or business relationship with the company, any shareholder of the company who owns 5 percent or more of any class of securities, or any person who is or can be deemed to be an agent of any of the persons listed above.\n\nRule 17 of the Securities and Exchange Commission Code of Corporate Governance Rules provides that an insider includes a director\u2019s immediate family including spouse, son, daughter, mother, or father.\n\nRead also: Umahi suspends perm sec over extortion\n\nWhat is unpublished price-sensitive information?\n\nThis is information that is capable of affecting decisions to be made in relation to a company. It is information that if made available to the public may affect their dealings with the company. Such information is capable of affecting the value of shares of a company.\n\nIs insider trading an offence?\n\nSection 115 ISA states that it is a criminal offense and any person who commits such an offense is liable on conviction to a fine in the case of an individual of not less than N500,000 or an amount equivalent to double the profit derived or loss averted from the use of the information obtained, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years.\n\nIn the case of a body corporate, N1,000,000 or an amount equivalent to twice the amount of profit derived by it or the loss averted. Section 116 ISA adds that a person found guilty shall also be liable to pay compensation at the order of the commission or the Tribunal to any person who suffers a loss as a result of such trade.\n\nWhy is insider trading an offence?\n\nAs an information-driven market, the misuse of confidential information of a company poses serious danger to the capital markets.\n\nIt has been opined that the prices of financial assets such as shares, stock, and bonds, are a reflection of the information that are made known to the public. Information guides the public towards its dealings with a company, and the type of information available will influence decisions with regard to dealings with the company.\n\nPrice-sensitive information is therefore information that materially affects the value of securities. Section 112 of the ISA 2007 prohibits the abuse of non-public price-sensitive information obtained in an official capacity.\n\nAre private companies exempt from insider trading?\n\nIn Nigeria, there seems to be no clear framework on insider trading for private companies. The various laws prohibiting insider trading seem to speak only about public companies.\n\nHowever, where a private company does acts that are similar to that of a public company, then such a company for the purpose of insider trading could be treated as a public company without any public listing as seen in some climes. For instance, a private company offering stock options to its employees could be treated as a public company if the issue of insider trading arises.\n\nHowever, the law has not taken any position on this. Section 22 (1) \u2013 (2) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 provides that a private company is one whose memorandum states that it is such and that subject to the provisions in its Articles of association, it may restrict the transfer of shares. Where the provisions of a company\u2019s Articles restrict the transfer of shares, such a company cannot offer shares for sale.\n\nThe repealed 1990 CAMA strictly prohibited the transfer of shares in private companies. But with the new 2020 law, private companies may transfer or sell shares provided it is allowed for by their article of association. A private company will not be doing anything wrong if it sells shares or offers stock options if the Articles of the company allow for it.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes that the law against insider trading applied to private companies. In an announcement made on 12 December 2011, the US SEC announced an enforcement proceeding that serves as a useful reminder that the federal laws against insider trading and misrepresentation applied to private companies purchasing stock from employees and other shareholders as it is done in the public companies.\n\nBy this provision, a private company that is registered in the US and Nigeria could be liable in the US if it breaches insider trading rules.",

          "text": "This digest is for artists\n\nThis digest is brought to you by Patrons MCAA. Patrons is a full-suite art advisory firm that helps private and corporate art collectors with diversifying their wealth through art collection, appraisal, packaging & transportation, storage, insurance, maintenance and restoration.\n\nTitle: Break forth from the Cyst | Artist: Steve Ekpenisi | Medium: Shredded mild steel plate\n\nSize: 182 cm | Year: 2021\n\nTaking a cue from Oscar Wilde\u2019s popular quote, \u201cWhen bankers get together for dinner, they discuss Art. When artists get together to dine, they discuss money.\u201d This week\u2019s publication will focus on the dynamics of pricing your art as an artist.\n\nIf you are an artist reading this digest, you would agree that figuring out what your next art piece will be is never really an issue. It is often said that good artists can create art blindfolded. From history, one of the early struggles new and young artists seemingly face at the start of their career is in relation to the business side of their profession; pricing their art.\n\nArguably, it is not easy to set a price on a piece that does not yet have a market value. Being creative, artists may feel that their artworks are priceless but then they quickly realise that they must balance that with monetising their creativity. Overcharging and undercharging collectors is a big concern they have to bear.\n\nAppropriately pricing your artworks ensures that as an artist, you can earn and live comfortably and grow financially through your craft.\n\nHere are 6 tips you can put into practice:\n\nSize based pricing\n\nYou can set a price per square inch. Then, multiply the length and breadth of your artwork in inches. Your total should be multiplied by the price you set per square inch.\n\nLet us use a simple example to simplify this math. First, we will assume that the price per square inch is $2. Next we will assume that the length of your artwork is 14 inches and breadth is 12 inches. Your result from that multiplication will be $2 x 14 x 12 = $336. You can choose to round down the price to $330 or leave it at $336.\n\nDo your research\n\nSometimes, artists undermine the extent and usefulness of their network and fail to leverage it. By reaching out to other artists, especially those at a similar career phase as you are, you can discover much about how they price and run their art business. Beyond just pricing, you can get answers to questions such as these; \u2018What is the average price for framed works? Or sketch works?\u2019 \u2018How about unframed works?\u2019 \u2018Does a stretched painting cost more?\u2019 \u2018How do I price my sculptures?\u2019 Be sure to take into consideration the perception you want to establish for your brand as an artist when taking in suggestions and recommendations from industry peers. What makes you unique as an artist is how you set yourself apart from the crowd.\n\nDo not undercharge\n\nFor fear of an overcharge and the need to make ends meet, a lot of artists undercharge when they sell their works to collectors. At the very least, artists need to ensure the full cost of production \u2013 canvas, paint, framing, logistics, and everything in between \u2013 is covered in their pricing. Deduce how much you are worth per hour, calculate or estimate how many hours it will take you or it took you to get the finished product, then add it to the cost of the artwork. Think of yourself as a consultant who is working for a client, and charge per hour billing accordingly.\n\nFor example, say you place your per hour billing at $8, and you spend a total of 15 hours from start to finish. First, we would calculate the total consultative cost of the artwork based on the number of hours you spent creating it to be $120 ($8 x 15). Next, we would consider the cost spent purchasing the materials used, let us assume $35. Framing the artwork cost $150. Total transportation cost incurred is $100. The total cost price of your artwork will then be $405.\n\nSet a price and stick to it\n\nWhen you set your price, you are basically setting your standard. Be confident in sticking to your standard irrespective of how tempting it may sometimes be for you to sell for less. Collectors can easily spot it when you lack confidence in your self assumed value.\n\nA word of caution here however, do not try to overprice yourself. Based on your acceptance and growth in the industry, you want to set realistic prices without feeling obligated to lower your value. You must always be ready to justify to the collecting community the value placed on yourself and your artworks.\n\nConsider varied pricing\n\nAs an artist you fundamentally know that the more collected your art is, the more conversations you spark within the collecting community, the quicker your value grows. That being said, collectors who may be interacting with you for the first time may be turned off by a significantly priced artwork of yours. To mitigate losing such interests, you may consider creating small sized or miniature pieces priced affordably. A collector who is unable to afford a $3,000 painting may be able to afford a $350 miniature piece by the same artist.\n\nNot only does this ensure you still get to make a sale, it broadens your reach within the collecting community and is a great way to get collectors in the rink. When a collector displays your artwork in his home or office, he will be inclined to fall in love with your artwork and style. It will be a conversation starter when he hosts guests, and thus, you enjoy more exposure as people will be curious to learn more about you.\n\nRepresentation matters\n\nGallerists are very comfortable talking about art and money. They are in the business of art and have mastered the art of pricing. Simply put, gallerists are able to convince collectors that the art they sell is worth the asking price. Having a gallerist represent you as an artist not only brings about more credibility to you as a brand, but also shields you from talking shop.\n\nGalleries are influencing institutions within the collecting community and can chart the course of an artists\u2019 career. They have the reputation, the influence, long standing relationships with collectors, critics, fellow dealers, museums and other institutions within arms length.\n\nPricing is a constant struggle many artists face. If this is you, I hope you found this digest insightful.\n\nIf you are still unsure about how to go about pricing your artwork, Patrons can be a soundboard for you on this. We have 20+ years industry experience in representing artists and in art dealerships.\n\nUntil next digest,",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, commissioned 68 housing units, under the National Housing Programme (NHP) Phase 1, in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\nObaseki, at the unveiling of the units, called for increased collaboration between the state and federal governments, as well as other stakeholders to address the housing deficit in the country.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the National Bureau of Statistics has shown, we have over twenty million housing deficit in Nigeria, which means that very many Nigerians are living without proper shelter. The World Bank recommends at least a million homes annually to bridge this gap.\n\n\u201cBut due to limited resources and economic challenges, it is difficult for us to attain this goal. It is very important to encourage all partners, particularly the federal government, that collaboration is very key. While we congratulate them and appreciate what they have done, we are saying that the road ahead is very long.\n\n\u201cThe pace at which we are going is very slow. We need to change the strategy; 65 units of housing after nine years of construction will not solve our problems. We need to do more, and as a state, we are going to collaborate with the federal government to achieve the desired goals.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile considering the gains of this project, it\u2019s pertinent to note and underscore the need to develop other aspects of the housing industry that will help us move at a much faster pace and one of them is mortgages. Unless we introduce a virile, realistic, and affordable mortgage arrangement we will not be able to develop housing as we want to.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we are very committed to housing projects. As we speak, we have about four projects which we are working on already.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWe are prepared to work with all partners including the federal government and communities to make sure that we take the issue of housing development very seriously. We would like to collaborate with the federal government. We hope that the next phase will not be developed the way this one has been developed.\n\n\u201cWe have more land, so we shouldn\u2019t be doing housing like this on four hectares. We have more land to give to you; we also understand some of the challenges you faced, but those challenges can be overcome. We need to collaborate closely.\n\n\u201cI believe that the dream of the federal government to tackle her housing deficit will be best accomplished with a closer working collaboration with states so that we can jointly build houses for Nigerians at the rate which we need to build. If we go on at this rate, half of us will be on the street.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, President Buhari, who was represented by Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, commended the state government for providing the land and the host community for their cooperation in ensuring the project is completed.\n\n\u201cThis is a benefit of inter-government collaboration despite the political divide. This is one of the first phases of the several phases of the Federal Government Housing projects since 2016.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Senate, on Thursday, at plenary approved President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework.\n\nThe approval followed the consideration of a report by the Senate Committee on Finance.\n\nThe report was laid and presented by the Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Olamilekan Adeola.(APC \u2013 Lagos).\n\nSenate accordingly approved the $73 dollars per barrel proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari, including approving oil production volume of 1.600 million per day;\n\nA Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy of N4 trillion; and a cut in the provision for Federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80.\n\nWhile approving an increase in the Federal Government Independent Revenue of N400 billion, Senate gave its approval for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater to the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nA breakdown of the net reductions are as follows: NDDC, by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; and UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion.\n\nOthers are Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nThe chamber also approved a fiscal deficit of N7.35 trillion.\n\nIn his presentation, Adeola said that the total budget deficit was projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAccording to him, the incremental deficit would be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\nLawmakers, who made contributions on the report for the review of the 2022 fiscal framework, attributed the Nigeria\u2019s economic downturn to crude oil theft.\n\nSen. Olubunmi Adetunmbi (APC \u2013 Ekiti), said the federal government and security agencies owed it a duty to stop the stealing of our common wealth.\n\nHe decried that at a time when most countries of the world were reaping hugely from the increase in crude oil prices caused by the Russia-Ukrainian crisis, Nigeria was left out for its inability to meet its OPEC quota.\n\nThe Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, said the country should be in a state of mourning over its current experience, attributing the failure of security agencies to protect oil assets as a major reason for the decline of the economy.\n\nHe expressed concern over rising cases of oil theft despite huge resources allocated to the military, police and other security agencies.\n\nOther Senators, like Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue ), Betty Apiafi (PDP Rivers), urged the Senate not to hastily approve the President\u2019s request to adjust the 2022 fiscal framework until certain questions were answered.\n\nWhile Suswam raised concerns on the widening gap in budget deficit and the federal government\u2019s decision to resort to funding from the Capital Market, Apiafi, demanded answers from the NNPC and relevant agencies on solutions to curb crude oil theft.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks, called on the Federal Government to take \u201cradical\u201d steps towards stopping the theft of crude oil by economic saboteurs.\n\nHe also called for a stop to the importation of refined petroleum products into the country, so as to cut down on expenditures incurred in the process, as well as to maximize profits from crude oil sales.\n\n\u201cThis (crude theft) is not something to play politics with, and I don\u2019t think the answers are going to be easy to come by.\n\n\u201cRadical decisions would have to be taken, but before we find answers we have to live with this, though we have to be as fast as possible in looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI had a session with the Chief of Defence Staff about a month ago, and my discussions with him were on the oil theft and the efforts of our security agencies to combat this menace.\n\n\u201cAnd like we know, our security agencies are doing their best, but we have people \u2013 our people \u2013 who are sabotaging the oil industry, because oil theft is not perpetrated by somebody else but by people who are citizens.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to continue to support the security agencies in whatever way possible so that they are able to deal with this.\n\n\u201cI also believe that, whether there is oil theft or not, until we stop the importation of refined products to Nigeria, we will never get the best out of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWe should, therefore, work to ensure that we produce our refined products locally, because that is one way of cutting our expenditure on importation.\n\n\u201cI also think that diversification of the economy is key, because we depend so much on this oil and gas industry, the slightest issues that affects it internationally affects us seriously in our country,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Anyim Pius Anyim, a former senate president has appealed to members of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) not to repeat the mistake they in 2015 that cost the party power.\n\nAnyim, a presidential aspirant on the opposition party\u2019s platform, encouraged members of the party to take advantage of the situation in the country today to return it to power in 2023.\n\nThe former secretary to the government of the federation made the appeal on Friday in Abuja during a meeting with zonal leaders of the party from the six geo political zones.\n\nHe advised that if the PDP was ready to rescue the country, its leadership at the national level must not only toe the line of equity, justice and fairness but also close ranks towards producing its next presidential candidate\n\n\u201cThe mistake that we must not make, is the mistake that was made in 2015. In 2015, some of us in the PDP, simply decided to pull out of the PDP and breakdown our members and we were plunged into darkness. That is why we are here. If we are to rescue the country, that is actually the rescinding mission that we have to undertake,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor us to rescue this country, we have to reinvent ourselves as a party. We have to first set ourselves on the path of equity, on the path of fairness and on the path of justice. When we set ourselves on this part, then we would be able to lift our country on the pedestrian path where everybody would build on.\n\n\u201cOne thing I actually want you to know that is actually the problem that we have today, is that we have not realised that politics is not just a game, that we are playing with the destiny of the people. We have not realised that politics is not just a game but the framework and the only platform under which a nation is built. When nation building becomes a game, you plunge the nation into darkness, and that is what we have today.\u201d\n\nAnyim, who promised to continue from where former President Goodluck Jonathan stopped, solicited the support of PDP\u2019s zonal excos at the meeting, noting that their role might just be the game changer at the end of the day.\n\nThis just as he promised, like Goodluck Jonathan did, to draft the best heads to manage the economy.\n\nAnyim continued: \u201cZonal excos may be the arm and frame that may decide who becomes the next president of this country.\n\n\u201cPlease support me, return me to power, let me continue from where Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan stopped. We have a systematic plan to return the country on the path of peace and prosperity.\n\n\u201cAll through my public service life, I have always worked under the presidency. I haven\u2019t worked anywhere outside the presidency all my entire career in the public service, even as the President of the Senate, I was working alongside the president and eventually as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, which is the engine room of the government.\n\n\u201cWhen that administration brought back Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the Coordinating Minister for the Economy, our economy was rebased. When our economy was rebased, Nigerian economy became the largest in Africa. Now where are we?\n\n\u201cThere were policies we put in place, there were plans we also tried to put in place, there were policies that also encouraged foreign investors to come into Nigeria. Today where are they?\n\n\u201cThese are things you don\u2019t do overnight; these are things you do systematically. And we were planning that in the second term of President Goodluck Jonathan, we would stretch out these plans and policies. Unfortunately, that administration was truncated.\n\n\u201cSupport me so that we can set this country again on the path of peace, growth and prosperity.\n\n\u201cWhat I want you to know today is that the crisis of our nation today, the challenges of our nation, demands a unifier, demands a crisis manager and a stabiliser.\n\n\u201cI will build consensus across board. I will make sure I secure the binding of every component of our polity before I deploy any policy that will make us move forward.\n\n\u201cI will work with you as partners. I will recognise the party as the owner of the government. Like I told the NWC, that I will run the party\u2019s manifesto not my own manifesto. I have laid down my plans and my own personal plan is to give effect to the manifesto of the party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the betrayal of people to democracy that brought us this far. When the expectations from what they would get as dividends of democracy failed, that is where people started falling apart,\u201d he said.",

The President without informing Tinubu offered the post to the Lagos AG. The first thing Osinbajo did was to inform his principal, Tinubu, who gave him a free hand to take his decision.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Ogunsakin said \u201cOsinbajo made a request to Obasanjo: \u201cRelease Lagos Council funds.\u201d Obasanjo replied that Osinbajo should first take the appointment and then advise him as Attorney General of the Federation on the matter.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo went underground and for weeks, Obasanjo could no longer reach him. It was obvious to the President that Osinbajo deliberately avoided him. He went on to appoint Chief Bayo Ojo SAN as his AGF and Minister of Justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOsinbajo rejected the position of AGF and Minister of Justice and stayed with Tinubu! Nobody complained then,\u201d the award winning journalist noted.\n\nSpeaking further, Ogunsakin said, \u201cthe Vice President not only stood with Tinubu, but stayed loyal to Lagos State. He did not betray Tinubu then\u201d.\n\nCautioning those calling Osinbajo a betrayer, Ogunsakin said \u201cbut now when it is convenient for them, some political and religious bigots are shouting betrayal!\n\nEveryone knows that if you want to hear the story of how your father met your mother, join politics.\u201d\n\nHe urged anyone criticising the Vice President on account of his declaration for the presidency \u201cto do so on valid facts!

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has come under fire over what has been described as his unnecessary, politically motivated, ill-advised and hasty decision to grant pardon to two former Governors jailed for corrupt practices.\n\nSenator Joshua Dariye of Plateau State and Mr Jolly Nyame of Taraba State, who were convicted for corruption, were recently pardoned on health and age grounds when they still have several years to complete their jail terms.\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, wondered how the President has reached a consideration that at their relatively young ages they are too old to be in prison confinement whereas there are thousands of awaiting trial inmates and convicted prisoners who are above 80 in Nigerian prisons whose offences are as simple as theft of chickens from their neighbours.\n\nHURIWA said this discrimination on the basis of political connection will adversely harm the rule of law.\n\nHURIWA recalled that the National Council of State had granted state pardon to Dariye and Nyame of Plateau and Taraba States respectively.\n\nThe rights group recalled that the two former governors were among 159 prisoners pardoned by the Council at a meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries are a former military general and minister under the Sani Abacha regime, Tajudeen Olanrewaju, an army lieutenant colonel, Akiyode, who was an aide of former deputy to General Abacha, Oladipo Diya; and all the junior officers jailed over the 1990 abortive Gideon Orkar coup.\n\nHURIWA applauded the release of the military officers most of whom were roped into phantom charges of a coup plot by the then maximum dictator General Sani Abacha.\n\nHURIWA recalled that Mr Nyame, who is 66, governor of Taraba State from 1999 to 2007, was serving a 12-year jail term at the Kuje prison for misappropriation of funds while he was in office. The Supreme Court upheld his conviction in February 2020.\n\nRelatedly, Mr Dariye who later got elected as Senator, who is 64, and governed Plateau between 1999 and 2007, was jailed for stealing N2 billion of public funds during his time as Plateau State governor between 1999 and 2007. The former governor, elected as senator representing Plateau Central in the Senate in 2015, was sentenced in June 2018 but still completed his tenure in jail in June 2019.\n\nHURIWA however condemned the early release of the duo, particularly on the ground of seeking to use their political popularity in their minority northern Christian states of Plateau and Taraba to canvass Electoral advantage for the All Progressives Congress in whose administration since 2015 the only high profile politicians jailed for corruption are the two Christian Northerners.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement signed by the national coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said it was a scandal of monumental proportions that whilst the two Christians and former governors of the northern states of Plateau and Taraba were jailed for corruption, a bulk of other corrupt former Northern Governors who are all Moslems are roaming about freely because the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission skewed it\u2019s prosecutorial activities to target mostly Christians and Southerners because of the domination of Northern Moslems in the hierarchy of the EFCC.\n\nHURIWA said the best way to begin a thoroughly professional anti-graft war is to ensure Federal character in the appointment of directors for the anti-graft body currently dominated by Northern Moslems.\n\nHURIWA said it views the action of early release from jail of these politicians who had barely served 30% of their total jail terms as a confirmation of the well-known notoriety of the Buhari led administration as a harbinger of the most sophisticated forms of corruption but which administration chooses to use the instrumentality of the so-called anti-corruption crusade to whip opposition politicians to the line.\n\n\u201cThere has never really been any crusade against corruption in the real sense of it. What EFCC does mostly is to harass students carrying expensive phones and laptops and to parade them as YAHOOYAHOO. Whereas the real big time CORRUPT politicians who are looting Nigeria dry and mindlessly are allowed to have a field day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now survival of the fittest and the most connected in Nigeria of 2022\u201d.",

          "title": "Easter: Christians brace up for another \u2018gloomy\u2019 celebration",
          "text": "\u2026Nigeria seized with despair \u2013 Catholic bishops \u2018\u2026 Season for sober reflection, not fanfare\u2019 \u2026Rising insecurity worrisome \u2013 Businessman\n\nAs Christians in Nigeria prepare to celebrate this year\u2019s Easter insecurity, inflation, disruptions in power supply, exchange rate wahala and high cost of transportation, among others, appear to have all conspired to make the celebration another gloomy one, BENJAMIN UMUTEME and PAUL OKAH report.\n\nIn years past, the Easter season was usually evoked a time of celebration for both Christian and non-Christians as they scheduled events for the holiday. However, the situation has continued to change over time with many families unable to share in the Easter joy following myriads of challenges. From insecurity to high cost of living and unreliable power supply among others appear to have conspired to take their joy away.\n\nNigerians bemoan hardship\n\nFor Harrison Ikechukwu, a resident of Jikwoyi,\n\nwhat was supposed to be a period of celebration was being viewed by many with reservation. In a chat with Blueprint Weekend he said, \u201cThe Easter was not pocket friendly.\u201d\n\nIkechukwu, who is a plumber, said, \u201cFor me, this Easter will come and go like any other day. Several of my clients are yet to pay me several weeks after I completed their jobs. The complaint is that they don\u2019t have money. So, you can see why I said the Easter will come and go like any other day.\u201d\n\nFor Mrs Blessing Benjamin, she was is yet to feel that a major celebration like Easter was coming up. According to Blessing, who manages a poultry farm, it seemed as if people would not celebrate Easter this year.\n\n\u201cBy this time last year, many families had made payment for chickens, but it is not so this year, it has been the same story from many of them; \u2018things get as e be\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that her price might be scaring people of, she said: \u201cEverybody in this country knows that the price of goods is not the same as it was last year, so, I cannot sell my birds at a loss,\u201d\n\nInsecurity as a factor\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend, a businessman in Abuja, Mr Peter Chukwu, said though he was interested in travelling home to celebrate Easter the rising cases of insecurity in Nigeria, especially the South-east, had prevented him from travelling to Anambra to celebrate with his family.\n\nHe said: \u201cI like Easter for what it stands for. It is a period to celebrate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. The activities for the celebration usually commence from the Palm Sunday, which we marked a few days ago as Catholics.\n\n\u201cStaying in Abuja for years, I usually use this period to travel as a result of too many activities in the village, especially family meetings, weddings and other social activities.\n\n\u201cHowever, the rising cases of insecurity recorded in different parts of the country are matters of concern. Because of the killings and kidnappings going on, I have decided not to travel this time around. My state is affected much as there is always news of killing and other forms of violence being perpetrated by unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cAnambra is no longer what it used to be. I don\u2019t want to become a victim by travelling to be kidnapped or killed by those I don\u2019t even know how they get their information.\n\n\u201cMy people have a saying that precaution is not cowardice. I am just taking precaution by deciding not to travel home this time around.\n\n\u201cHowever, since there is no end to Easter celebrations, I hope that the security situation will improve so that I can travel next year.\n\n\u201cAlready, I have made excuses to those at home and even sent money across to those I was supposed to attend their social functions. They all understand. Even God himself understands that we can worship Him and celebrate anywhere we are, we don\u2019t necessarily have to travel home before celebrating Easter. Hopefully, things will return to normal in Nigeria and we will resume celebrating Easter in peace.\u201d\n\nHigh cost of living\n\nAlso speaking, a civil servant, Mrs Rita Asuquo, said the high cost of living has prevented her plans of travelling with her family to celebrate Easter in Cross River state.\n\nShe said: \u201cOur world is changing. Easter and all forms of religious celebration are no longer enjoyed because of rising cost of living. The situation has become so bad that we can no longer afford the things that usually made celebrations of this nature memorable.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people looked forward to celebrating Easter with friends and family members because things were affordable. However, the situation is no longer the same.\n\n\u201cPresently, people are struggling to feed and provide for their families. You can hardly find families inviting friends to come and celebrate with them as a result of the rise in the cost of food items.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything in the market today has doubled in price, when compared to what was obtainable last year and years ago. Which one will I mention or leave out? Is it the price of rice that is now N700 per mudu? Is it beans? Is it chicken or food condiments? Yet, there is no increase in salary. We are still receiving what we were paid years ago as civil servants.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t travel home on Christmas as a result of not being able to afford many things that would have made the celebration memorable. We then expected to travel this Easter to Ugep in Cross River state, but this year has been crazy.\n\n\u201cMy husband is a businessman while I work as a civil servant, but the cost of transportation and food items are just no longer tolerable. Instead of travelling unprepared without four children, we have decided to travel in December.\n\n\u201cHonestly, my prayer is that the government should introduce policies that will checkmate the rising cost of living because the situation is no longer funny.\u201d\n\nEaster for sober reflection\n\nOn his part, a teacher, Mrs Edwina Ogochukwu, said that Easter was not the priority of many people like Christmas and has characteristically decided to celebrate with her family in Abuja.\n\nShe said: \u201cChristmas is a great time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and is usually marked with fanfare. However, the same cannot be said of Easter as it is usually a time for sober reflection on the death and resurrection of Christ and the significance of the resurrection to mankind.\n\n\u201cIt is not a surprise that many people pay more attention to Christmas than Easter. In fact, Easter is usually boring to many people, unlike Christmas, so you may not even notice that there is a celebration, except for the holiday by the federal government and closure of schools for just a week.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the many negative issues going on in this country will take the shine of this year\u2019s celebration. In the past, as a child, we usually looked forward to Easter, especially due to the role we played in church activities. However, as a parent, I no longer consider it of any consequence.\n\n\u201cFor one, the cost of living is just too high that I don\u2019t know where we are headed as a country. Unlike in the past where you would cook and invite neighbours to come and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ with you, it is all man for himself now as even insecurity is not allowing for better celebration.\n\n\u201cThis year particularly started on a bad note. We were greeted by fuel scarcity in January, February and March, which caused a rise in transportation, rising in price of goods and services and other negative trends.\n\n\u201cPeople are just recovering from the aforementioned, including a collapse in the national grid that plunged Nigerians into darkness, so not many people will even pay attention to the celebration of Easter.\n\n\u201cAs it is, many families are struggling to survive and won\u2019t bother about expenses if they can help it. However, it is a political period; so many things will hopefully change for the better.\u201d\n\n\u2018Celebration in dismal atmosphere\u2019\n\nThe Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has said that Nigeria was currently seized with despair occasioned by massacres, inflation and industrial action by university lecturers across the country.\n\nCBCN President, Most Revd Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji, made this known in his 2022 Easter message to the nation, Friday, through the National Directorate of Social Communications, Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a nation, we are celebrating Easter this year in a rather dismal atmosphere that breathes pessimism and despair. The growing insecurity of life and property in the country is compounded by the rising wave of mindless massacres of innocent citizens from unscrupulous terrorists, causing bereavement, trauma and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cEconomic hardship with soaring inflation continues to sweep across the nation like wildfire and seems to reduce millions of our country men and women to a life of wanton suffering and distress.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is thwarting the academic ambitions of many Nigerian students. In some parts of the country, workers are owed arrears of salary, while retired senior citizens eke out existence without regular pensions.\n\n\u201cMany young people are deeply wounded and degraded by unemployment and poverty, a poverty that breeds crimes and seeks relief in hard drugs.\n\n\u201cThe appalling economic condition is worsened by the present scarcity of fuel, which is as puzzling as it is frustrating. This horrible state of affairs is driving many compatriots to a feeling of cynicism as they gaze at a gloomy future that seems to promise them little or nothing.\u201d\n\nThe CBCN also said the 2023 general elections should not be regarded as a do-or-die affair; calling on politicians to ensure that there was no bloodshed during the polls.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Bishops, \u201cAs we draw closer to another period of general elections, which are often characterised by bloody conflicts, we urge everyone seeking an electoral office to embrace the spirit of sportsmanship and not to see a political contest as a do-or-die affair.\n\n\u201cWe also implore one and all to make a personal commitment to non-violence. This is because violence only breeds violence. The vicious cycle of violence results in utter destruction and is never a solution to any human problem.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, far from fighting and killing one another as a way of settling differences, we should say no more bitterness and killings.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges bedevilling the nation, the Bishops stated that the central message of Easter is that when the pressures of life seem heavy; there is a light at the end of a dark tunnel.\n\n\u201cThis message of hope underscores that even though the forces of evil might seem at times to have an upper hand over the good, on the long run the good will triumph over evil. Accordingly, far from yielding to pessimism and despair, we should face the future with hope and optimism, and always try to persevere to the end in hard and difficult circumstances,\u201d CBCN stated.",

I assure you that I\u2019m a listener, I will listen to everybody but I will not be able to solve each and every problem of the individual.\n\nAlkali had worked in Ministries of Justice, Police Affairs, and the State House.

Chukwunwike Ogbonna Uzo, welcomed the new Permanent Secretary and said that it was his first time for over thirty-three years of service to witness a Permanent Secretary taken over in a Ministry and all his former directors accompanying him.

But it is a gain to us in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,\u2019\u2019 Uzo said.\n\nUzo handed over two sets of handover notes, that of the former Permanent Secretary and that of when he acted as the Director Overseeing the Permanent Secretary\u2019s Office.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThere are a number of procedures to be followed by the Federal Government before removing the subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol.\n\nOne of such critical steps to be taken is the provision of an effective public transportation system in the country, Professor Kingsley Moghalu suggested on Friday.\n\nMoghalu, a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) between 2009 and 2014, made the recommendation during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today.\n\n\u201cIf you spent N1 trillion; you don\u2019t even have to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you spend N500 billion, you could have a very effective public transportation system across this whole country and the people, therefore, who can afford petrol when you remove the subsidy \u2013 the middle class and wealthy people; they can carry on and poor people who can\u2019t afford the commercial price of petrol which is being subsidised today can use public transport to move around.\n\n\u201cThat is what we should be going for but that is not where we are at this point.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria\u2019s Inflation Rate Hits 15.92% As Food, Gas Prices Rise\n\nThe political economist and former presidential candidate is also in support of removing the subsidy on petrol in the country.\n\nBut he wants the removal to be implemented only when the government has made adequate preparations to cater to the needs of the poor people in the society.\n\nAccording to Moghalu, the current price of petrol in Nigeria is ridiculously cheap compared to other African nations and this is a major factor fuelling the smuggling of the product in parts of the country\n\n\u201cI think subsidy is really like a bone in our throat \u2026 it is a very difficult problem but as to whether it should continue, let me tell you the answer is no; but you cannot remove it precipitately,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThere should be a proper plan of investments in public transportation before you can remove petroleum subsidy. I want you to note that the only hydrocarbon product that is subsidised now in Nigeria is Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) \u2013 petrol; diesel, kerosine, all those other things are selling at commercial prices.\n\n\u201cSo, there is nothing impossible about removing the petroleum subsidy, although some people may want to make it look as if it is an entitlement we have because we produce petrol.\u201d\n\nOn the way forward, the former CBN deputy governor said, \u201cWe need to get a refinery in this country functioning at capacity, and that is likely going to be the Dangote refinery.\n\n\u201cWe have to get our refineries working and one of the reasons the state refineries have collapsed is just because of the inefficiency and the incompetence of economic management in the Nigerian state.\u201d",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Gov Yahaya Bello is APC\u2019s best bet",
          "text": "The Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation says the governor Yahaya Bello possesses all the attributes that can retain the presidency for the ruling All Progressives Congress in 2023.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity of the Campaign Organisation, Yemi Kolapo, added that the well experienced and accomplished leaders of the party would not sacrifice Bello\u2019s winning attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics.\n\nShe said this in a statement she signed and made available to journalists on Friday.\n\nAccording to her, the party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult.\n\nHighlighting the attributes that distinguished Governor Bello as the candidate to beat, the media directorate said aside from Bello\u2019s plethora of obvious achievements in Kogi State, he enjoyed the massive support of Nigerian women and youths, which must not be ignored, considering their numerical strength.\n\nHis uncommon loyalty to the President, his colleagues, and allies, among others, as well as his clean records as regards the issue of betrayal of any form, among others, were some of the attributes listed in his favour.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe stage is almost set for Nigerians to, once again, choose the leaders that will steer the affairs of the nation at all levels for another four years. But before the general elections, the struggle is within the parties, and in that regard, many have put their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cThe presidential race in the ruling All Progressives Congress is populated by known heavyweights in Nigeria\u2019s politics, and in the next few weeks, depending on what the party decides, all aspirants that have had the courage to declare so far and those still preparing to do so, would have to jostle for just one ticket.\n\n\u201cSome groups have even almost concluded that this ticket belongs to a particular zone as a result of some prior unwritten agreement, but those who have the interest of the nation at heart have said, times without number, that there is no zoning in the constitution of the party, and more importantly, that the best must get the job, regardless of his zone, if the wellbeing of the country is the target.\n\n\u201cOn the 2nd of April 2022, His Excellency, Governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello, formally declared to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 under the platform of the APC. In his signature bold manner, the declaration ceremony at the Eagle Square, Abuja, has been described, even by unrelenting critics as the first-of-its-kind in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis was even more significant because, while others veiled their declaration under other programmes, others, afraid to test their popularity the way of Governor Bello, settled for video recordings of their declaration speeches.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed commendable that despite the fears that there would be an irreversible crack in the APC after the last Convention, the party, under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, proved naysayers wrong and had a rancour-free exercise, which has produced leaders of note to man the different offices in the party.\n\n\u201cThe party, in its wisdom, knows that, after eight years, it must present that candidate that can win the next election, considering the \u201cwe against them\u201d attitude of citizens in many countries to the government of the day, which usually makes retaining power, under a free and fair environment, difficult for incumbents. There are, however, many reasons the choice of Yahaya Bello would make the journey easier for the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe party needs a candidate that can connect massively with women and youths, considering their combined numerical strength and that candidate is no other than Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cThe preference of Nigerians, regardless of tribe, religion or party affiliation, for a younger leader is also very clear. Of the pool of aspirants, as the country stands today, even across party lines, Governor Yahaya Bello is the best bet for the younger generation if this dream must be actualized.\n\n\u201cThis consideration has made millions of youths across Nigeria resolve to put their numbers behind the Governor, and this is verifiable with the number of active youths with PVCs currently on the Bello Ambassadors Network, Rescue Nigeria Mission, and Yahaya Bello Network, among many other support groups.\n\n\u201cAgain, the North-Central, where Governor Bello comes from, has not produced a democratically elected president in the history of Nigeria, and so, irrespective of what people are made to believe, they will support their own when it is time to take a stand. The North Central believes strongly that the time for them to occupy the Aso Rock Villa is now. Being the strongest contender from the region places Governor Bello in a vantage position to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is an acclaimed unifier. It is a well known fact that, for the first time in the history of Kogi State, the sharp, bitter division between the three major ethnic groups gave way to unity and harmony under the Governor. He united the tribes, starting from his cabinet, and today, everyone is first a Kogi indigene before being identified with his ethnic group. Nigeria needs a unifier now more than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is ever ready to build on the President\u2019s efforts in this regard. How he turned the state from a notorious state, where kidnappers and criminals built empires, to one of the safest in Nigeria today and, conveniently, the safest in the north, is a question that has been on the lips of many Nigerians. Therefore, in terms of the main issues confronting the nation, Governor Yahaya Bello has excelled remarkably in Kogi State.\n\n\u201cThe loyalty of Governor Bello to the leader of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari, has often been described by critics as \u201cannoying\u201d, but this is the stuff our aspirant is made of. He is loyal to his friends, colleagues and allies, and more so, to the APC. He has demonstrated this on so many occasions, even in very difficult situations. He has no record of betrayal to his party members and his principles. He is a fair game player.\n\n\u201cThe current well experienced and accomplished party leaders would definitely not sacrifice these laudable attributes for \u201cdestructive\u201d politics. They will rally round Governor Yahaya Bello and retain the presidency with a wide margin come 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "The 68 passengers abducted by terrorists on March 28 after the bombing of an Abuja-Kaduna train are today 20 days old in the dungeon of the terrorists, with families and friends accusing the federal government and security agencies of not doing anything tangible to free them.\n\nOn Friday, some relations of the abductees based in Kaduna State threatened to resist any attempt by the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to resume the Abuja-Kaduna train services without rescuing their loved ones.\n\n\n\nThe terror attack also left eight persons dead at the scene, two others died in the hospital from gunshot injuries sustained, and with several others still nursing their wounds in hospital.\n\n\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe terrorists had few days ago released a two-minute video, showing scores of abductees sitting in a forest, including men, women and children. Behind them was a group of gunmen standing in a line.\n\nOne of the abductees said in Hausa: \u201cIt is only us that know the dire situation we are in, there are women and children here; there are aged people with health challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the video, the terrorists said the government knew what they wanted, threatening to kill those in custody if their demands were not met.\n\nThe video clearly showed the abductees in anguish. Some of them are believed to be carrying bullet wounds. They are being traumatised in a forest, amid mosquitos, hash conditions and many other dangers.\n\nThere is also a pregnant woman and some children with the terrorists in the very harsh environment.\n\nSources said the abductees were made to trek for five days, resting intermittently in transit camps, before they arrived at the main camp of the attackers around Shiroro Local Government Area in Niger State.\n\n\n\nThe released Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, BOA, Alwan Hassan, while recounting his ordeal a few days back, said 41 women, 22 men, 5 kids were with the terrorists.\n\nThe federal government had assured that it would do everything necessary to ensure the release of those still being held hostage but families and friends of the victims said they had not seen anything concrete being done in this direction.\n\nThe families, who said the federal government and security agencies had not deemed it fit to get in touch with them, are pleading with the terrorists to allow them negotiate the release of their relations.\n\nOne of the abducted family members, Aliyu Mohammed, who spoke in Abuja last Thursday, begged the terrorists to give room for families to negotiate the release of their loved ones.\n\n\n\nMohammed said: \u201cIt is the families, and not the government, that will bear the brunt should anything untoward happen to the abductees.\u201d\n\nAlso last week, some of the victims\u2019 families staged a peaceful protest at the Radio House in Abuja, with placards appealing to the federal government to do more in ensuring that they are released.\n\n\n\nAliyu Mahmud, a relative of a seven-month pregnant woman, had said: \u201cI have my sister who is seven months pregnant with her husband. Words cannot explain what they are going through and what we are going through. Please, the government should do the needful and let this come to an end as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThey should try as much as possible to reach out to the perpetrators and rescue our loved ones. There are children there, pregnant women, the sick, the aged and only God knows what they are going through.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do, we think of them. When we eat, we think of them. When we sleep, anything we do, we think of them. We are pleading with the government to please do the needful so that this situation will come to an end as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother protester, Aminu Uthman, said: \u201cMy immediate younger brother and his wife are among the victims. It is a nightmare and the most difficult days I have had in my life. I cannot sleep or eat. A lot of things are going wrong.\n\n\u201cThe bandits called only once and they gave him the phone to speak to us. They are yet to make any request but they called to say he is with them. We voted for this government because of insecurity. We had the trust that they would address insecurity. This protest is not for the family members alone; it is for Nigerians generally. This thing can happen to anybody.\u201d\n\nSome other relatives of the kidnapped victims also met in Kaduna early in the week and accused the federal government of insensitivity towards the plight of the abductees.\n\nDr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, who led and spoke on behalf of the kidnapped relatives, said they were yet to establish contact with their loved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident on March 28, 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is better for the government to go into negotiation with the terrorists as they have demanded to secure the release of our loved ones alive.\n\n\u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Transportation are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it. Until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening a channel of communication with them (terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done everywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cEven the US, Israel and the most powerful nations of the world, do negotiate when they have issues like this to preserve the lives of their citizens. This, we know our government can do and we are appealing to them to do it. We don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens. Life is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the Nigerian government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do. We are appealing to them to come out to open a channel of discussion with the bandits and get our loved ones out as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe have been in serious anguish in the past 15 days. Many of us have not been sleeping, we have not been sleeping. We are like living corpses.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than 362 passengers were onboard the train at the time terrorists struck on March 28.\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna",

Resource-rich countries, especially their extractive sectors, will see improved economic performance due to the war in Ukraine, while non-resource rich countries will experience a deceleration in economic activity,\u201d said the World Bank.\n\n\n\nIn the report, the World Bank, estimates growth in Sub-Saharan Africa at 3.6 per cent in 2022, down from 4 per cent in 2021, as the region continues to deal with new COVID-19 variants, global inflation, supply disruptions and climate shocks.\n\nThe bank explained that recovery remained uneven, incomplete and was happening at varied rates of speed across the region.\n\nIt said this was due in part to elevated oil prices and good performance in the non-oil sector.\n\n\n\nIt said: Excluding Angola, Nigeria and South Africa, regional growth is projected at 4.1 per cent in 2022, and 4.9 per cent in 2023. The Eastern and Southern Africa sub-region shows sustained recovery from the recession, at 4.1 per cent in 2021, down to 3.1 per cent in 2022 and settling around 3.8 per cent in 2024.\u201d\n\nThe region\u2019s growth challenges, the World Bank report said, are rising global commodity prices, which are increasing at a faster pace since the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIt pointed out that as top world exporters of food staples \u2013 Russia and Ukraine \u2013 for a substantial share of wheat, corn and seed oil imports, all of which may be halted if the conflict persists.\n\nWhile Sub-Saharan economies are also likely to be impacted by tightening of global conditions and reduced foreign financial flows into the region, the analysis notes that the high fuel and food prices will translate into higher inflation across African countries, hurting poor and vulnerable citizens, especially those living in urban areas.\n\n\n\nThe bank cited one point of concern as the increased likelihood of civil strife as a result of food and energy-fueled inflation, particularly in the current environment of heightened political instability.\n\n\u201cAs African countries face continued uncertainty, supply disruptions and soaring food and fertilizer prices, trade policy can potentially play a key role by ensuring the free flow of food across borders throughout the region. Amid limited fiscal space, policymakers must look to innovative solutions such as reducing or waiving import duties on staple foods temporarily to provide relief to their citizens,\u201d said World Bank Chief Economist for Africa, Albert Zeufack.\n\n\n\nThe report highlighted the importance of expanding social protection programmes beyond safety nets to strengthen economic resilience and responsiveness to shocks, particularly for poor and vulnerable households.\n\nRecommendations include developing social insurance, savings and labour market programmes that contribute to economic resilience by protecting urban informal workers and help the population invest in their health and education.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "Plans to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda are a breach of international law, the UN\u2019s refugee agency has said.\n\nThe UNHCR said attempting to \u201cshift responsibility\u201d for claims of refugee status was \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nBoris Johnson has said he believes the scheme complies with international law.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that Priti Patel issued a \u201cministerial direction\u201d to launch the policy amid concerns from Home Office civil servants.\n\nCivil servants could not precisely quantify the benefits of the policy and uncertainty about the costs meant the home secretary had to take personal responsibility for it by issuing the direction.\n\nA source close to Ms Patel said that \u201cdeterring illegal entry would create significant savings\u201d and the fact that the savings could not be quantified precisely should not prevent action from being taken.\n\nMinisterial directions have been used 46 times since the 2010 election, with two in the Home Office since 1990, according to the Institute for Government think tank.\n\nThe only other time the formal order was used by the Home Office was in 2019 by the former home secretary Sajid Javid, to bring in the Windrush Compensation Scheme before legislation was in place.\n\nUnder the \u00a3120m pilot scheme, people deemed to have entered the UK unlawfully since 1 January could be flown to Rwanda, where they will be allowed to apply for the right to settle in the east African country.\n\nThe government said the first flights could begin within weeks, initially focusing on single men who crossed the Channel in small boats or lorries.\n\nMore than 160 charities and campaign groups have urged the government to scrap the plan, while opposition parties and some Conservatives have also criticised the policy.\n\nGillian Triggs, an assistant secretary-general at the UNHCR, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s the World At One programme the agency strongly condemned \u201coutsourcing\u201d the responsibility of considering refugee status to another country.\n\nA former president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, she said such policies \u2013 as used in Australia \u2013 could be effective as a deterrent but there were \u201cmuch more legally effective ways of achieving the same outcome\u201d.\n\nAustralia has used offshore detention centres since 2001, with thousands of asylum seekers being transferred out of the country since then.\n\nIt has been frequently criticised by the UN and rights groups over substandard conditions at its centres and its own projections show it will spend $811.8m (\u00a3460m) on offshore processing in 2021-22.\n\nMs Triggs pointed out Israel had attempted to send Eritrean and Sudanese refugees to Rwanda, but they \u201csimply left the country and started the process all over again\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it is not actually a long-term deterrent,\u201d she said.\n\nShadow justice minister Ellie Reeves called the policy \u201cunworkable\u201d and said if Labour was in charge, it would make it illegal to advertise people smuggling on social media and work more closely with France and others to tackle trafficking gangs.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nNo-one the BBC initially spoke to yesterday seemed to know about the Rwanda announcement \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t long before word spread.\n\nSoon a group of men was asking us lots of questions: \u201cWhen will this happen? Why? If I come from Afghanistan will it still apply to me?\u201d\n\nShafi, who told me he had fled Afghanistan, said: \u201c[Rwanda] is a lot worse place than Afghanistan, there is no future for us in Rwanda.\u201d\n\nBut I didn\u2019t meet anyone who said the government\u2019s plans would prevent them from trying to cross the Channel, including Shafi, who said he had no choice.\n\nMany of these men have already faced huge risks to get this far and are willing to risk their lives crossing the Channel on a small boat.\n\nThe risk of being sent to Rwanda, at this stage, seemed like just another thing to factor in down the line.\n\nA number of lawyers have warned the plan will face legal obstacles, such as the international human rights principle of \u201cnon-refoulement\u201d \u2013 which guarantees no one can be returned to a country where they would face irreparable harm.\n\nLast year, the UK government raised concerns at the UN about allegations of \u201cextrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture\u201d in Rwanda, as well as restrictions to civil and political rights.\n\nBut justice and migration minister Tom Pursglove said Rwanda was a progressive country that wanted to provide sanctuary and had made \u201chuge strides forward\u201d in the past three decades.\n\nMs Patel said the British public had been \u201ccrying out for change for years\u201d and it was \u201cincredibly unfair to the British public to see organisations in their own country effectively just putting blockages after blockages in the way\u201d.\n\nThe announcement came as part of a broader strategy to reduce the number of people entering the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats.\n\nThe Royal Navy has taken operational command of the Channel from UK Border Force in an effort to detect every boat headed to the UK.\n\nSome 562 people on 14 boats made the journey on the day the new scheme was announced, according to the Ministry of Defence. No-one making the crossing was believed to have arrived on UK soil \u201con their own terms\u201d, it added.\n\nLast year, 28,526 people made the crossing, up from 8,404 in 2020.\n\nBBC",
