          "title": "Doctors canvass innovative ways to solve Africa\u2019s health challenges",
          "text": "Two medical entrepreneurs, Dr Yetunde Ayo-Oyalowo and Dr Funmi Adewara, have called for innovative strategies to combat the problem of universal access to health care in Africa.\n\nBoth doctors, who are female inventors of accessible healthcare services, also emphasised the need for solutions that were affordable, easy-to-reach, sustainable and efficient to solve the challenges in the healthcare sector.\n\nDr Funmi Adewara, who is the founder of Mobihealth International, stated that Nigeria and Africa needed access to healthcare services, adding that community-based solutions and technology could be leveraged to get to the least reached areas.\n\nAdewara said, \u201cAs we move forward on the path of development Nigeria and Africa\u2019s ability to create sustainable and efficient access to health care will depend largely on its capacity to invent, deploy and scale up solutions that are sensitive and appropriate for individuals and local communities.\u201d\n\nShe commended the activities of other healthcare organisations providing innovative solutions to accessible healthcare services, adding that through the use of technology, Mobihealth had been able to provide accessible healthcare services to the end-users.\n\nThe medical expert said, \u201cThere are many other organisations doing their part in improving access to care including Mobihealth International, deploying technology through Artificial intelligence-powered digital health tools to harness local and global medical human capital and resources to enable healthcare access to the last mile.\n\n\u201cMobihealth\u2019s innovate initiatives has been commended by the United Nations as an inclusive and sustainable healthcare solution and recently won the World Bank SDGs Award 2020 amongst 2400 contestants globally, a first time win for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ayo-Oyalowo, who is the founder of Market Doctors, a company that provides affordable basic medical services to Nigeria\u2019s underserved population, said an innovative way was needed to solve the problem of universal access to health care in Africa.\n\nAccording to her, if a person has to choose between having a meal and access to healthcare, there is a problem.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe journey time to the facility, the time they will spend seeing the doctor, having tests, going to the pharmacy; they don\u2019t want to lose their income for that day. So, what were are trying to do is to put all of these together, reduce the overhead, bundle healthcare into their shopping bags as they come to the market.\n\n\u201cThe way our services works is been able to convert any space into a clinic by either using a mobile truck or even a health worker with a backpack. We have reached over 180,000 people. Market Doctors is going to be the game-changer in health care in Africa.\u201d\n\nAyo-Oyalowo added that Market Doctors was born out of the burden to provide accessible and proper health care services to ordinary Nigerians who do not have access to health insurance and rely on concoctions when they are sick.\n\n\u201cI felt ordinary people do not have access to health care. I once worked in a health insurance company and I discovered that even with the reduced price only a little percentage of people could afford health insurance and health insurance is a sort of gateway to good health care.\n\nSo, I thought what happens to the man on the street, how will they be able to access health care? So I asked around and I found out that people already found a way for themselves in going to the chemist and using the local concoction. So that was what formed the idea of what I can do to create access to the common Nigerian. That was how I began the journey,\u201d she added.\n\nThe medical entrepreneur also said through the donation of some people on their birthday, they have been able to provide more healthcare services for those in need of it.\n\nShe added, \u201cWe are also specialists in outreaches, we help organisations conduct outreaches and we have a programme called \u2018birthday blessings,\u2019 where we conduct special medical outreaches on the birthdays of those who donate to us.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

UK based entrepreneur and CEO of Oil Money Records, Alafaa Kariboye Igbo who graduated from London University has condemned the decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea at all. Most online campaigns are being done via twitter and it has also affected young Nigerians and showbiz practitioners who ply their trade on that platform. Three days after the twitter ban in Nigeria, the A4AI (Alliance for Affordable Internet) put Nigeria\u2019s economic loss at $1.2b. A watchdog organisation, NetBlocks, also remarked that each hour of the Nigerian government\u2019s decision cost $250,000 (N102.5 million), bringing the daily loss to N2.5 billion, he said.\n\nOn why he started Oil Money Records, the Rivers State indigene said:\u201d The name Oil Money was divinely inspired. It\u2019s not man-made. Because oil doesn\u2019t stop rushing, we decided to adopt the name believing that with God on our side, our wealth will be sustained.\n\nOil Money Records was established to help nurture the music talents of young Nigerians who are exceptional and excellent in their chosen craft. We provide them a platform and they grow from there\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further, the philanthropist also urged young Nigerians to always stay focused and not to give up on their dreams.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things in Nigeria that would make anyone want to give up.But I would advise every young Nigerian out there to keep striving hard and believe their dreams are valid. Don\u2019t allow your physical circumstances determines how far you rise\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that he would be overjoyed when he makes the Forbes Billionaires list.\n\n\n\n\u201cForbes is a respected platform. I will be overjoyed when I make the Forbes Billionaires list. It is something I am working on and with God on my side I know it will happen\u201d.\n\n\n\nAsked if he has passion for politics, Oil Money Boss simply said: \u201cI don\u2019t see myself venturing into that terrain for now\u201d.",

          "text": "By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna\n\nKaduna State governor, Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai, has said on Saturday that he does not have any presidential ambition, contrary to widespread speculations in that regard.\n\nEl-Rufai, who claimed to have \u201csuffered presidential ambition suspicion for 15 years\u201d, said at 62, he is too old lead Nigeria.\n\nMaking the foregoing clarifications in an interview with the Pidgin Service of the BBC, the Kaduna State governor also explained the reason behind his decision to quietly withdraw his two children from a public school in Kaduna.\n\nHe regretted that his purported ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president had caused some people to paint him in bad light, including calling him a Jihadist, just to keep him out of presidential race.\n\nHe said that governing Kaduna State alone was telling on his age, not to talk of the entire country.\n\nHe said he considered governing Nigeria as a job that is too much for a 62-year-old man.\n\nHe said: \u201cLook at me, look at my grey hair. If you see my picture when I was sworn in, my hair was very black, but look at how it has become.\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult job, and that is just state governor, one state out of 36. A big one, yes; a difficult one, yes, but it is not the same as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPresidency of Nigeria is a very serious job; it is too much for a 62-year-old.\u201d\n\nAsked if he is interested in the office of the Vice-President, he said: \u201cI have not thought about it at all. I have said it that in the political system we have, after eight years of President Buhari, the presidency should go to the south.\n\n\u201cI have been suffering this presidential ambition suspicion since 2006. I have suffered it for 15 years today, and I am sick and tired of it.\n\n\u201cThere are people that are out to paint me in a particular picture so that I will be out of the presidential race, but they don\u2019t know that I am not in any race anywhere.\n\n\u201cThey have called me all sorts of names. They said I am a Hausa-Fulani irredentist; I am Jihadist and all that. Jihadist when? Where? I am not even an active member of any Islamic organisation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am Muslim, yes, a devout one. But I believe religion is private. Even here in this office, when it is time for prayer, I just excuse myself as if I am going to the restroom. I don\u2019t ask anyone to come and pray with me, because we will all go into our graves separately.\n\n\u201cLook around me as see; I am surrounded only by Muslims. This government is the only state government in this country that has at least people from 13 other states of the Federation as cabinet members.\n\n\u201cOne of the most influential persons in my life, one of my closest political associates is Pastor Tunde Bakare.\n\n\u201cIt was Pastor Tunde Bakare that actually introduced me to Buhari and CPC. I didn\u2019t join the CPC because Buhari lives in Kaduna or he is a northerner.\n\n\u201cSo, if I am an Islamic Jihadist, why will Pastor Tunde Bakare be speaking to me?\u201d\n\n\u2018Why I withdrew my son from public school\u2019\n\nEl-Rufai also revealed that there was a plan by three groups of bandits to kidnap his son, Abubakar Sadiq, from Kaduna Capital School; a public school where he was enrolled in 2019.\n\nThe governor said following the intelligence at his disposal, he had to withdraw the kid from the school so that he would not fall victim to kidnappers or expose his schoolmates to danger in the event of an attack by gunmen.\n\nThe governor said he had also enrolled Sadiq\u2019s younger sister, Nasrine, in the same school when she turned six years before the security situation in the state forced the family to withdraw the children temporarily.\n\nThe two children are currently taught at home but go to the public school during the examination period.\n\nHe said the kids would resume fully once the security situation in the state improves.\n\nHis words: \u201cMy son and also my daughter are registered in the school because his (Sadiq\u2019s) sister also clocked six and we registered her in the school.\n\n\u201cBut we had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we received a security report that three groups were planning to attack the school and kidnap my son.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they (kidnappers) would have succeeded because there is enough security in the school to prevent them, but it would expose other pupils of the school to danger.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know the kind of weapons they would have brought.\n\n\u201cI had taken a stand against payment of ransom and we had reports that three groups were planning to kidnap my son from Capital School to see whether I would pay ransom or not if my son is kidnapped.\u201d\n\nHe said he was persuaded by the advice of security agencies to withdraw the kids for the time being.",

          "title": "Igboho, Kanu: Who is naive now?",
          "text": "By Adekunle Ade-Adeleye\n\nThe interception of Nnamdi Kanu and the storming of Sunday Igboho\u2019s mansion last week were clearly and deliberately orchestrated by the government\u2019s security forces. These were not isolated or coincidental events. They show a determined effort by the government to stamp out any attempt towards separatism. Mr Kanu was brought in from abroad; it needed months of preparation to carry out. The assault on Mr Igboho\u2019s house probably needed a week or two of planning, possibly more. Both events not only show the capacity of government to do so much damage and project state power, they also indicated very disturbingly the limited capacity of government to consult very widely before embarking on critical missions. This limited capacity has been a leitmotif of the current administration. It borders on naivety. The government spent so much time planning the two events; it is not clear that they spent as much time on, anticipating the fallout. For a multi-religious and multi-ethnic society, everything is not about force or the projection of state power.\n\nThe interception of Mr Kanu is certain to have its consequences, domestically and internationally. Questions are going to be asked concerning how the government pulled it off and whether it violated international and diplomatic rules. The county from where Mr Kanu was intercepted, when the whole story comes out, will experience some uproar, particularly if it is a democracy. Questions are going to be asked about whether Nigeria has extradition treaty with that country and what are the details of that treaty. Was the treaty respected to the letter, or was it abridged, or was it flagrantly violated? If there is suspicion that any diplomatic or extradition rule was violated, that country, if it is a democracy, will have it tough explaining to its electorate and cabinet. But if that country is like Nigeria where democracy has been severely abridged, then the questions may be stifled. Importantly too, because Mr Kanu holds a British passport, and is therefore a British citizen who is a victim of possibly a questionable extradition, the matter as to how Mr Kanu was intercepted is unlikely to die down any time soon. Nigeria may have ceased to be a robust democracy, it will be optimistic on its part to expect that other democracies are as eager to subvert their own rule of law and constitutional rule.\n\nThe assault on Mr Igboho\u2019s house clearly yielded very little, despite the government\u2019s rose-coloured narrative of the assault. From all indications, given the instability in the country and the total lack of security, Mr Igboho was not prepared to wage war on the state. He was prepared instead to defend himself to the death. The legality of the arms and ammunition allegedly found in his house is a different thing all together. What the government sought to do is not to prevent any \u2018waging of war\u2019 on the part of Mr Igboho; it was to take him out of circulation considering what he stood and still stands for. The manner in which the government executed the assault is going to raise speculations as to the motive of the administration. Questions are going to be asked about what is motivating the government: Is it Mr Igboho\u2019s \u2018war\u2019 against herdsmen and other criminals making the Southwest countryside unsafe? Or is it the transformation of his campaign against herdsmen to his advocacy for secession that has troubled the administration? Mr Igboho was unwise not to have limited his campaign to restoring peace and tranquility to Southwest countryside. It would have remained a popular campaign, a campaign that would probably have stood the test of time. By making a detour to the highly politicised subject of secession, he entered the murky waters of politics.The concensus that propelled his entrance into the consciousness of most south-westerners was unlikely, in the matter of secession, to sustain him throughout the region in particular and Nigeria as a whole. Up till now, there has been no concensus either in the Southwest or Nigeria as a whole as to the attractiveness or viability of secession. Mr Igboho should have restricted himself to his initial objective.\n\nBut regardless of Mr Igboho\u2019s missteps, and not withstanding the government\u2019s post-assault justifications, the midnight assault by the Department of State Service (DSS) cannot be justified in any way. The timing was hideous; and the style was gangster-like. Worse, questions will and should be asked as to the quality of intelligence available to the government. Already, many people suspect that the government was simply out to neutralise Mr Igboho. The scale of destruction levelled against Mr Igboho\u2019s property, the controversy over looted money, and the killing of some people during the assault are bound to further exacerbate tension, not only in the Southwest, but in the country. More and more, people will begin to lose faith in the country.\n\nThe overall implication of the interception of Mr Kanu and the assault on Mr Igboho\u2019s residence will be to worsen insecurity. Mr Kanu\u2019s supporters will completely lose faith in the country they have been indoctrinated to hate. They will now see no reason to dialogue with the government; they will see the government more or less as an outlaw; and they will dismiss the government as one committed to their destruction. Mr Kanu himself can be trusted to exploit his trial. He will exploit it to the hilt. Mr Igboho is not the perfect embodiment of the Southwest\u2019s angst against insecurity in their countryside and highways. As imperfect as he is as a manifestation of regional anger against a government that seems to have no clue as to how to restore peace and security, the assault on him will not lessen regional grievances. It is even more likely that he and his supporters will go underground and have no other way to ventilate their animosity against a state that has proved incompetent to keep criminals at bay.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf the administration had been less pigheaded in approaching the issue of insecurity and alienation, they would have let Mr Kanu stay abroad, run his mouth as much as he wanted, while the government walked cautiously in undermining and counteracting his message. What Mr Igboho needed was not a brutal assault on his property, but a carefully cultivated message to restore hope and security in the Southwest. Neither Mr Kanu nor Mr Igboho was as popular as when their campaigns began; their messages were already wilting and needed only time. But since the government was not willing to wait or be disciplined in their approach, they have now demonstrated dangerous naivety in thinking that their approach will exterpate the grievances by the Southwest and Southeast against the state.\n\nAPC headquarters rechristening and Appeal Court oath fiasco\n\nJust when Nigerians thought they had plumbed the depths of despair in their politics, something far worse comes from the sewers. Two Fridays ago, when the APC caretaker committee went to brief the president on what they had done with the two six-month extra time they had been given to rearrange the affair of a party that was not broken but had secured back-to-back poll victories, they baited him with the rechristening of their party headquarters in Abuja. It would henceforth be known as Muhammadu Buhari House, they announced. The president accepted the flattery, just as he strangely thought nothing of the unseemly decision by Transport minister Rotimi Amaechi to site the new Transportation University in Daura.\n\nIf you thought this was bad enough, you were in for a worse shock days later when, during the swearing in of new Court of Appeal justices, one of the justices, Olasumbo Goodluck, decided unilaterally and for reasons not unconnected with religion, to replace God in the oath with Allah. The Chief Justice of Nigeria compelled her to retake the oath. Was she trying to provoke another round of religious controversy by that heedless and unnecessary gambit? Did she not realize that such indiscretion could serve as a ground for some litigants to ask her to recuse herself from a case before her on the grounds that impartiality and neutrality could not be guaranteed?",
          "summary": "Mr Kanu was brought in from abroad; it needed months of preparation to carry out.\nThe interception of Mr Kanu is certain to have its consequences, domestically and internationally.\nImportantly too, because Mr Kanu holds a British passport, and is therefore a British citizen who is a victim of possibly a questionable extradition, the matter as to how Mr Kanu was intercepted is unlikely to die down any time soon.\nThe overall implication of the interception of Mr Kanu and the assault on Mr Igboho\u2019s residence will be to worsen insecurity.\nNeither Mr Kanu nor Mr Igboho was as popular as when their campaigns began; their messages were already wilting and needed only time.",

          "text": "By Tatalo Alamu\n\nSometimes when a society finds itself engulfed by violence and political irrationality, it is often better to take a peep into the past in order to have a fuller prospective view of what may lie in store. When history repeats itself, it is not due to \u201chistory\u201d but due to the persistence and recurrence of human follies and what has been called the eternal cycle of human stupidity. What follows are excerpts from a piece in 2014 commemorating the centenary of amalgamation of the Southern and Northern protectorates of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith the equipoise of contending regional titans and their perfectly weighed prejudices and preferences, it was impossible to unify and homogenize the emergent national elite. By the same token and logic, it was impossible for a supreme Nigerian leader to emerge and prevail. The stage was then set for a prolonged and protracted siege on the state by the major nationalities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChief Obafemi Awolowo , arguably the most gifted and administratively capable of them, identified the major problem of the nation as feudalism in the north. But ignoring the political realities and contending cultural milieu, he chose to attack the problem frontally by attempting to bypass the northern feudal lords to reach the people directly. This panicked the old north. It was said that once on a campaign trail, the Sardauna coughed up dust and phlegm and then exploded that Awolowo would have to pay dearly for this grave insult of forcing a prince to campaign to his own subjects.\n\nWith the west on fire and the entire nation roiling in a political cauldron, was a coup inevitable? Virtually so. It was also in keeping with the norms of the time. Unlike now, it was the time when the men on horseback were viewed as an alternative modernizing elite. Ahmadu Bello\u2019s error of judgment arose from his equating a feudal fiefdom with a nation-state that was not of his making and the attempt to impose the norms on people of radically divergent worldviews.\n\nThere was bound to be a collision of altars and a national tragedy when this worldview came into fatal contradiction with a fiercely republican ethos that had no truck with a feudal pecking order. Yet by virtue of the same cultural logic the mutiny by mid-ranking officers of mainly Igbo origins was so politically clueless, so motivated by bloodthirsty and irrational vengeance, that it became part of the national problem.\n\nAs we slouch towards another epic political gridlock chillingly reminiscent of fifty years ago, it is clear that what Nigeria needs is a new national elite that will draw up a fresh charter for the nation. A National Conference, sovereign or otherwise, might remove the constraints if it addresses genuine fears and grievances, but it will not give us a new elite, except in circumstances of tumult and turmoil. But unless we find the will and the willpower to create Nigeria anew, the fat lady will soon come on stage.",

          "title": "Cattle grazing routes: The real story",
          "text": "By Chidi Obineche\n\n\u201cWhat I did was ask him (Abubakar Malami, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice) to go dig (out) the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south, or east to west, they had to go through there. If you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The Khadi or the Judge will say, pay this amount and if you can\u2019t, the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given, and people were behaving themselves. In the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places; there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known. So I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nWith these words on Arise Television \u201cMorning Show\u201d interview on June 10, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari lit up a fire that has smouldered and raged for weeks on end. It was not the first time that the grey issue of cattle grazing routes would seize the momentum in the country, or generate a national furore. Violent conflicts between nomadic herders from the north of Nigeria often referred to as Fulani herdsmen and sedentary agrarian communities in the central and southern parts of the country have assumed frightening dimensions in the recent past, threatening national peace, unity, and stability.\n\nIn 2016 alone, the clashes recorded an estimated death toll of 2,500.The fatalities are increasing with each passing year. Conflict resolution mechanisms to reform livestock management practices, confront environmental issues and address cross-border movements of armed herders and cattle rustlers, identified as some of the triggers of the crises have been less than satisfactory and have not paid off. Issues of land and water use, obstruction of traditional routes, livestock theft and crop damages have not been visited with firm and prompt response. Their roots run deeper. The road to this impasse has been tough and grueling.\n\nAccording to the Grazing Reserves Law of 1965, Nigeria has 415 grazing reserves but only about one third of it is functional. Others have been encroached on through infrastructural developments, (houses, roads etc) or being used for crop farming. About 141 of the grazing routes are officially logged or gazetted. But less than 20 of them are currently suitable for use by pastoralists. For some people, the presidential order is long awaited, needful, and a product of circumstances; others see it as unlawful and an attempt to stir up temper.\n\nHow the mess started\n\nThe advent of colonial rule in Nigeria modified the pattern of life of the pastoral Fulani. The relative peace and security that came with the British rule encouraged them to move out of their fortified and overcrowded villages to the grazing areas. Consequently, nomadic lifestyle, which is traditional to the Fulani ethnic group, began to grow in proportions. The cattle population of the northern emirates according to reports during the colonial era was between \u201cthree and four and a half million.\u201d The estimation was based on the distribution of cattle for the revenue reports. The figures of the report were obtained from cattle tax returns (Jangali) which were based on native administration officials\u2019 returns.\n\nGovernor W Edgerton of Lagos, in his confidential report of 1905 for the abolition of the caravan tolls, confirmed the dependency of the southern provinces on the importation of cattle from the northern emirates. He said: \u201cthere was a scarcity of meat for local requirements, especially in the Lagos area, because of the reduction in supply from Fulani/Hausa traders as a result of toll regulations.\u201d In the annual report of Sokoto province for the year 1909, Resident Burdon recorded his observations that cattle was the staple export and expressed his desire to see to the development of the trade \u201cas the great economic future of the province.\u201d\n\nThere was a widespread belief that still subsists, that nomadic cattle ownership was part of the ageless and unalterable pattern of African life. No effort was made to coerce or induce the Fulani herders to settle and be integrated into a farm economy. From the first decade of the 20th century, the demand for cattle increased, particularly from the southwest, from Ilorin southwards to Lagos. The growth of human population and settlements, expansion of public infrastructure and acquisition of land by big farmers and other commercial interests have shunted herders out of the post independence government of the former northern region (now split into 19 states).The existing fragile relationship among the ethnic and religious groups in the country has been escalated by the conflicts. The predominantly Christian communities of the south loathe the influx of basically Muslim herders usually referred to as \u201cIslamisation force\u201d. And since these herders are mostly Fulani, their motives have been given a skewed interpretation as they are viewed with suspicion and as harboring an ethnic and religious agenda.\n\nWhy Fulani herdsmen carry arms\n\nAn official at the Federal Ministry of Justice gave an insight into why the herdsmen move about with arms. His words: \u201cThe social standing of the Fulani herdsmen depends on the number of cows he has. This thing is tied to their culture and religion. They don\u2019t believe in buying land or being involved in other ostentatious acquisitions. They believe in what nature offers them. They carry arms because the forest is a jungle. They kill each other and steal each other\u2019s cows. That is cattle rustling. What they do is to sell one or two cows and use the money to purchase AK-47 guns probably between N450, 000 or N500, 000 to protect themselves. Thereafter, they redeploy the arms to other uses which is what is causing the herders /farmers mayhem.\u201d\n\nSaturday Sun further learnt that the herdsmen usually pay for grazing rights to some village heads to be allowed to graze in the village farms. But the village heads would pocket the money and fail to inform their subjects that they had been paid. The herdsmen therefore get angry and boil over when these farmers accost them in the farms and demand that they leave. After settling the village heads to have access to the farms, the angry herdsmen expectedly resort to violence over what they perceive as breach of contract.\n\nPrevious attempts at reopening the cattle grazing routes\n\nIn 2009, the federal government embarked on a programme that gulped a whopping $247 million to mark out grazing reserves across Katsina, and Bauchi as well as Abuja. Establishing these reserves which were deployed to attend to the needs of more than 15 million pastoralists entailed demarcating 175,000 hectares of grazing land, building veterinary units and constructing settlements for nomads to use on their way through. Government also launched the demarcation of a 1,400km livestock route from Sokoto State in the Northwest to Oyo state in the Southwest, and another 2000km route from Adamawa in the Northeast to Calabar in the South-south.\n\nIn addition to these grazing routes, the Federal Government in its tepid eagerness to address the problem holistically budgeted $10b for what it called Great Green Wall Program (GGWP) geared towards combating desertification, which is one of the major factors pushing pastoralists from the far north to the south in search of greener and richer grazing. The violent clashes between herdsmen and farmers indisputably revolve around encroachment on their grazing lands and migration routes and the setting aside of designated grazing areas for herders.\n\nStakeholders weigh in\n\nThese two issues usually spark off violence leading to killings, rapes, arsons, abductions, destruction of property, etc. The apex socio-cultural group of the Igbo, Ohanaeze in a swift reaction to Buhari\u2019s directive, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t ask people in an agrarian area like Benue and Enugu to cut out areas and designate them as grazing precincts just to avoid incessant conflicts with herders.\u201d The group which spoke through its President-General Prof. George Obiozor, said: \u201cThe proposal is simply provocative. Grazing fields mean less farmland and farm yields for a people who are mostly farmers and hamper food security and deplete the agricultural profile of these agrarian states.\u201d However, despite the ever increasing escalation of conflicts between the herders and farmers on a steady basis, no middle ground has been reached and an end to the search for grazing sites across the country still remain a remote prospect.\n\nThe Executive Director, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) Adetokunbo Mumuni argues that the gazetted law on cattle routes and reserves are part of northern Nigeria laws and is not applicable outside the north unless it is nationalized. Dr Ajibola Basiru, the senate spokesman and senator representing APC, Osun Central, insists there is no law on grazing routes in the country. He adds that grazing reserves recognized as a state law in the 1999 constitution criminalized open grazing. He said: \u201cGrazing Reserve laws in some states created from the former northern region of Nigeria are deemed to be state laws by section 318 of the 1999 constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cThey have been adopted from the Grazing Reserve Law of Northern Region of Nigeria (NN law of 1965) including Cap 3 laws of Kwara State, Cap 56 laws of Bauchi State, and Cap 55 laws of Katsina State. Such law cannot be within the competence of the National Assembly.\u201d In specifics, he explained that Section 37 of Grazing Law Cap 63 of Kwara State and Section 40 of the law prohibits possessing, carrying or using for any purpose, any firearms or other weapons for other purposes in the grazing areas.\n\nDan Nwanyanwu, National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party, (ZLP) says cattle routes will not reflect the demands of a 21st century development in cities and states. \u201cWhether they respect vital infrastructure along the so-called routes or not, the important issue is that Nigeria should not continue to live in the past. The government should not give the impression that it is partisan by taking us back to the stone age.\u201d\n\nHow the herders-farmers crises began\n\nThe Fulani ethnic group rears the majority of Nigeria\u2019s cattle, traditionally estimated at 83% pastoral, village cattle 18%, and Peri-urban 0.3%. They are spread across nine nations in the West African sub-region. They are core and traditional pastoralists. For pastoralists, cattle represent the major household asset and play a key role in status and prestige, and for cementing social relationships such as kinship and marriage. Before the 1950s, a symbiotic relationship existed between pastoralists, crop farmers and their environment with the Fulani practicing transhumance. In the dry season, they migrated to the southern part where there are ample pasture and green vegetation.\n\nIn the wet season, these areas faced the challenge of diseases transmitted by Tse-tse flies, so they would migrate back to the northern savannah zone, supplying dairy products to the local farming communities. In return, they received grains, and after the harvest, cattle were allowed to graze on crop residues in fields, and would leave behind droppings that become manure. Fulani do not have rights to land, a situation that breeds local conflicts when their herds damage crops.\n\nGrazing reserves came to the rescue of the Fulani in 1965 to provide them with secure land tenure, and to modernize the livestock sector, and dissuade them from nomadic lifestyle. As a follow up, between 1970 and 1980, the federal and state governments collectively invested $70m USD in livestock development. About 70 % of the amount was allocated to grazing reserves. While the selection and acquisition of grazing lands was placed on individual states, the reserves came through the National Livestock Project Unit (NLPU) of the Federal Livestock Department, now known as National Livestock Project Department. They are saddled with infrastructure development like provision of boreholes, dams, schools and roads.\n\nHowever, they failed to tap into the venture because of the absence of formal and comprehensive gazetting, non-legalized grazing, land ownership, slow provision of infrastructure. Many states were indifferent to establishing reserves because of the prohibitive amounts of land compensation occasioned by the Land Use Act, 1978. Today, according to official revelations, there are 415 grazing reserves in 21 states, and 141 are gazetted, while only 2 are in the south \u2013 Oyo and Ogun. But other unofficial sources insist that, of the 415 grazing reserves, only 1/3 is in use currently, while 24 of them are gazetted. As the livestock population increases, the graze-able land is decreasing. This led to increased tension between crop farmers and Fulani pastoralists. It is such that in the last decade, it has claimed no fewer than 2,000 lives, 16,000 houses, multiple rapes of females, kidnapping for ransom and other heinous crimes.\n\nRoadblocks and running battles\n\nThe problems of cattle grazing took a turn for the worse at the beginning of the current democratic dispensation in 1999 and gravely threatened the corporate existence of the country. By 2015, the herdsmen crises heightened with colossal damages. The federal government in 2018 conceived the idea of building cattle colonies for the herders, but it was resisted by many Nigerians and state governments mainly in the South, who perceived it as a grand ploy to grab land by the Fulani.\n\nShortly afterward, the government came up with Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) Initiative. It also fell flat on its face as it also was swiftly and stiffly resisted. Then, came the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). Under this programme, the Federal Government, Adamawa, Benue, Ebonyi, Edo, Kaduna, Nassarawa, Oyo, Plateau, Taraba and Zamfara states conceded to set up cattle ranches. Estimated to cost N179b over 10 years period, the two tiers of government were to throw in jointly N70b in the first three years of the pilot phase of the programme. Again, many Nigerians who believed it to be a clone of RUGA fought against it. Regardless, government forged ahead with the plan and launched the pilot phase in Adamawa, Nassarawa, and Plateau states in February 2020. But the rampaging COVID 19 pandemic then and the poor state of revenues of the federal and state governments jeopardized it.\n\nApart from political coloration of the efforts to sanitize pastoralism, other impediments have also combined to obstruct its progression. Chief among them is the Land Use Act, 1978. Section 1 of the act says:\u201d Subject to the provisions of the ACT, all land comprised in the territory of each state in the federation are hereby vested in the governor of that state.\u201d There is also the existence of a 1969 ruling by Justice Adewale Johnson which declared that \u201cthere is no grazing route established by law and protected by law\u201d. That judgment has not been set aside till today. The grazing routes gazetted and recognized by law existed only in states created from the old pre 1966 northern Nigeria. Even at that, the laws recognizing grazing routes are state laws and therefore inferior to the Land Use Act which is a federal law that enjoys protection in the constitution. Besides, open grazing of cattle is banned in the south of Nigeria and backed by state laws. The 141 gazetted routes cover only 2.7 million hectares of land, while the grazing reserves cover 4,275,326 hectares. The land mass covered is infinitesimal to make any progress or impact.\n\nCattle routes reopening in top gear\n\nFollowing President Buhari\u2019s directive to reopen the grazing routes, a rash of activities has seized the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Justice. Saturday Sun checks at the two ministries last week gave positive indication of an imminent reopening of the grazing routes and reserves as directed. Indeed, the reopening has flagged off in full force. The Acting Director of the Department of Animal Husbandry in the ministry, Mrs Winnie Lai-Solarin declined to comment on the unfolding development when contacted. So did two other senior officials of the ministry.\n\nHowever, information gathered indicates that stock routes are currently being retraced and recovered. Important landmarks along the known routes are being identified whether or not they have been built on or not. The focus for now is on the non-conflict areas. Those encroached on by vital public infrastructure are not to be effected in the recovery exercise. Some herdsmen have been drafted into the project to assist in the identification part of it. The exercise is being safely carried out, and based on the findings of Saturday Sun, the exercise, within the context of the controversial grazing reserve law, is slated to last for about 30 days.\n\nTo throw more light on the issue, a senior official at the ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak informed that, \u201cwe flagged off serious work on the project immediately after the President\u2019s pronouncement. It is not that nothing had been done before; the directive only infused some urgency into what we have been doing before now. A ministerial order gave vent to meetings which have been held regularly since then, with the minister co- coordinating. Before long, you will see the results. Teams have also been set up to work on the recovery plan of the stock routes and reserves. The government is desirous of putting this problem behind. Lobbying by various interests has intensified. We have legal support and advice from the Ministry of Justice to guide us. The lawyers are examining the laws not only for implementation, but also to scrutinize the legal effects and other matters connected to the directive. The Committees on Agriculture at the National Assembly are involved. They are currently in a meeting with all the state directors and the directors here as you can see (Monday, June 21, 2021). The National Assembly is being carried along so that there won\u2019t be any misunderstanding, delays or roadblock.\u201d\n\nHe added that the number of consenting states to the project is growing saying that as at the previous day 22 states and the Federal Capital Territory had keyed in for the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). Asked why the whole affair is shrouded in utmost secrecy, he responded that as civil servants it is a tradition. \u201cHere, only the Director of Publicity is authorized to speak, though directors can also speak.\u2019 He continues: \u201cwhen the grazing reserve law came into being in the 60\u2019s, the population of Nigeria was about 56 million people. The livestock population was around 3 million. The livestock population started increasing as human population grew too. The pressure to have corridors connecting cattle from one reserve to another increased too. Some of the reserves and stock routes were gazetted, while some were not. I don\u2019t understand it when people say the law was from the Northern Region. Was Oyo or Ogun State in the North? Can a northern regional government law be applicable in Oyo and Ogun? The truth is that infrastructural development, farmlands, estates have encroached on the stock routes and reserves. But don\u2019t forget that these Fulani herdsmen usually move with their little ones, especially sons, who eventually take over from them. Those children that migrated with their fathers about twenty or thirty years ago are now mature, and may have discovered and can recognize these routes after taking over from them. What about the dung and droppings of the cattle along the routes? As life-long professional herdsmen, they are astute at recognizing these droppings which look like manure along the routes. Unable to follow the route for grazing, the herdsman then moves into farms and any available green space with his cattle for grazing.\u201d\n\nResolving the herders-farmers clashes through legislation\n\nA source at the Ministry of Justice, explained: \u201cIn 2014, former Benue State governor Gabriel Suswan headed a committee to resolve the lingering clashes between herdsmen and farmers, mostly in central and southern Nigeria. Six years down the line, nothing has come out of the report and nerves are still frayed. At the moment, the position of the government will be legally driven.\u201d Only the courts can modify the decision of the government to resurrect the grazing routes, the source informed. According to him, \u2018we expect litigations. It is normal. In 1953, there was no Nigeria in the real sense. Such things could fly then, but not now. The ethnic and religious consciousness of the people has been awoken. The arms bearing by the Fulani herdsmen has also deepened the problem and put other Nigerians on edge. Perhaps, if they were not carrying arms, the sensitivity would have not been like this. So we await claims and litigations. The grazing reserves and stock routes are on the concurrent list in the 1999 constitution. So the issue of a presidential veto cannot arise if a modified bill is sent to him from the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the laws and the constitution are often observed in the breach. The citizens prefer to follow the leader and his body language. He explains further: \u201cIn America, it is America first. In Nigeria, it is the leader first.\u201d But he declined to affirm the nature, tempo and details of the law being planned although he rationalized it by quoting the late politician, Tony Anenih, that \u201ceverybody will leave the drawing board happy.\u201d\n\nHe also brushed aside the insinuations that cattle herding is a private business and should not attract government funding or intervention. His argument: \u201cIn various states of the country, farmers enjoy government fertilizer free. Is that one not private business? So what\u2019s wrong in government intervening financially in cattle rearing since it is causing problems in the country?\u201d Insisting that a fair view will help in providing solutions to the protracted problem, he reechoed some of the oft-expressed effusions of the apologists of Fulani herdsmen crises, saying: \u201cIn the amalgamation of nations, your landmass determines the sea mass. The sea reserves in the south are as a result of the landmass in the north equated at nautical miles. This is a different argument entirely. We should be able to perfect routes where these animals will go through. The issue of the cross-border Fulani is also important to be addressed. There is no clear demarcation in the north showing borders. They only put ropes to show the difference between countries. No formal borderline as opposed to the south. When you say \u2018border closed,\u2019 can you close an open border? Some of the Fulani don\u2019t know where they are from. The truth of the matter is that the herdsmen you see with the cattle are not the owners. The owners are the northern elite. They are in the background. They are the ones who are arming them to protect their stock because cattle are money.\u201d\n\nGoing further, he reminded Nigerians that the Attorney General of the Federation is not vested with powers to originate laws on the concurrent list. He said: \u201cWhen the states fail to make the laws, then federal laws will be binding on them.\u201d On a concluding note, he expressed optimism that the crises over cattle will fizzle away soon. \u201cThere will be no war. It will die a natural death in some months to come. The style of a leader often dictates the nature of governance and set-up. Some leaders prefer the use of force in attaining goals. Some prefer dialogue. Others just float with the times and the subjects adjust to his aura and things sort themselves out,\u201d he predicted. For Alhaji Gidado Siddiki, Southeast Zonal Chairman of MACBAN, \u201cany move that will douse the tension in the land is welcome.\u201d\n\nStates rev into action\n\nSeveral states in Nigeria\u2019s north have swung into action to re-open abandoned grazing reserves. At the last count, Katsina, Bauchi, Kano, Borno, Yobe and Niger have taken the lead in the revival process. In Katsina, over 2000km of cattle routes have been reclaimed. The Special Adviser to the governor on Livestock and Grazing Reserves, Dr. Lawal Bagida who spoke on the subject, said: \u201cWe already have a committee here, which has worked by marking the routes which have been gazetted.\u201d The routes are marked out using beacons. The state has also earmarked and gazetted 123,000 hectares of land for grazing.\n\nIn Bauchi, a machinery has been set in motion to revive the routes. In October 2020, ahead of the presidential directive, the state released a White Paper on the report of the Administrative Committee of Inquiry into a land dispute between farmers and herdsmen in Misau Local Government Area which recommended revocation of all lands illegally acquired by farmers and other persons and to reestablish grazing reserves and reopen all the cattle routes in the state. Kano State has announced that its grazing reserves and routes are functional and have never been closed. The State Commissioner for Information, Mallam Muhammadu Garuba said efforts are on to ensure that the presidential directive is not breached in any way.\n\nOwing to the fear of insurgency, the reopened routes and grazing reserves in Borno State have been abandoned. The Director, State Nomadic Education Directorate, Gambo Abasuwa Tom, said: \u201cthe routes were of different types, including local routes that linked one community to another within the state, interstate routes, as well as international routes which were in existence for a long period of time. Insurgency has displaced most of the pastoralists, while the majority of them have migrated to neighbouring states and countries. The state wants help from all concerned to restore normalcy and demarcate the routes.\u201d The routes were known by the pastoralists, community leaders, and policymakers before the advent of insurgency, the commissioner said.\n\nYobe State has, so far, recovered 31 international routes in Gujba LGA, the chairman of the Local Government Area, Alhaji Dala Mala has announced. While the State Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Breeders Association, (MACBAN) Alhaji Sarkin Shuwa described the presidential order as long awaited, the chairman of the Farmers Association in the State, Aliu Mai Bindiga, lamented that his members lost over 70% of their produce to herders\u2019 invasion this year.\n\nThe situation in Niger is slightly difficult because of the heightened insecurity in the state. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane said the state will opt for ranching after banditry in the state has been stamped out.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Shettima Calls for Power Shift to South, Insists on Rotation",
          "text": "\u2022Maintians there was a gentleman agreement on rotation in APC\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFormer Borno State Governor, Senator Kashim Shettima has thrown his weight behind the call for power shift to Southern Nigeria in 2023.\n\nHe said it was only proper for the North, especially the All Progressives Congress (APC), to allow power to shift to the South, insisting that there was a gentlemen\u2019s agreement that power must oscillate between North and South at the formation of the ruling party.\n\nShettima, who is now a Senator representing Borno Central, made the call for a power shift in Abuja yesterday at the public presentation of a book titled: \u201cStanding for the Truth with Courage\u201d.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cAfter power has resided in the North for eight years, the minimum is that there should be a power shift to the South for equity and justice. We are against oppression and marginalisation by any one group against another.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman agreement in the APC at its formative stage for power to rotate between the North and the South. And even in the colony of thieves, there exist a code of moral behaviour.\n\n\u201cJust because we are politicians, how can we believe anything goes?. NO!!! We should have minimal thresholds below which we shouldn\u2019t operate. President Buhari with his 12 million votes could not become the President on three attempts until we had a handshake across the river. We are an honourable people and we have to honour our commitment to that pact.\n\n\u201cThe minimum is for a power shift to Southern Nigeria, unless the advocates of power retention have a hidden agenda for the dismemberment of the nation. And to be fair to the President, he has neither endorsed nor showed a preference for any of the gladiators.\n\n\u201cWith all sense of modesty, if there\u2019s any title for a political godson, I can comfortably claim to be President Buhari\u2019s eldest political son. In both the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections, President Buhari garnered the highest quantum of votes, percentage-wise, not in his native Katsina State; not in Kaduna where he calls home for the past five decades; certainly not in Kano with a substantial Daurawa community nor Jigawa with his filial ties to neighbouring Kazaure Emirate. The President got the highest percentage of votes in Borno, where he garnered 97% in 2015 and 95% in 2019, followed by our sister state of Yobe.\u201d\n\nHe advised political gladiators across the country to give ear to his call, noting that: \u201cAs the Igbos would say, \u201cIf a child washes his hands, he could eat with kings\u201d. We have truly washed our hands and we are a major stakeholder in the Nigeria project. I believe we have a right to air our views and be listened to.\u201d\n\nHe said in his remarks at the book launch that the hope of the country rests on the mindset of her people, adding that the problem was not religion or ethnicity but people using them to achieve their goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur problems are not that of religion or ethnicity. Religion has become a body of rituals devoid of any practical value. People use religion to advance their interests \u2013 we have God on our lips and devil in our hearts.\n\n\u201cNo religion sanctions oppression. The hope for the black man rests not on South Africans or Kenyans. The hope for the black man rests with the people of this country.\u201d\n\nHe warned: \u201cWe have to make this country work. Our country of 211 million people, if this country is to implode, where are we going to go? Down is the Atlantic Ocean? Up is the Niger Republic? The population of the Niger Republic is not up to the population of Kano State. We are going to eat up the entire food reserves of the Niger Republic under two weeks. To our eastern side are the mountain ranges of Cameroon and the Central African Republic. They too have been contending with their problems.\n\n\u201cOn our western sides are the tiny states of Benin Republic, Togo, and Ghana. How can they contain us? I told some western ambassadors that if this country is to implode, we are not going to go through Libya. Our people will storm Europe through Morocco.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf just two million Syrians knocking on the doors of Europe have brought about Brexit and the emergence of Trump in America, what do you say of about 25 million English speaking Nigerians knocking on the doors of Europe? It would cause reverberations. I believe in equity, justice, and fairness.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the book launch, the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, called for unity and peaceful co-existence of Nigerians.\n\nHe said the best way to guarantee the unity of Nigeria was for all the people to come together while commending Joe Gadzama for using his experience to illustrate in his book the importance of standing for truth.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are going through difficult times in our country, economic and security, but let us recognise that the whole world is going through the same challenge.\n\n\u201cNigeria is part of the world. But the leadership under which we operate shows we shall indeed overcome all these. If we keep united, keep building, we cannot be ignored by any other country in the world.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that under the leadership of President Buhari, there is going to be a better future.

This meeting is in continuation of that agenda. It is a continuation of the meeting held in Asaba. The southern governors will be looking at the gains of the last meeting and come up with their next move.\n\n\u201cYou know the southern governors agreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken towards the restructuring of the Nigerian federation leading to the devolution of power.\n\nThey want inclusive government at the federal level, state police, a review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments, and creation of some other institutions, which will legitimately advance commitment to the practice of true federalism. Strategies are needed to actualise all these. This is why they are meeting again in Lagos.\u201d\n\nAnother source close to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is chief host, said in the spirit of Lagos hospitality, the Lagos governor has promised to provide a conducive environment for the 17 governors to brainstorm properly.\n\nDuring the first meeting in Asaba, the southern governors resolved to ban all forms of open grazing in the southern states of the country.\n\nAlthough, the governors came short of calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to reshuffle heads of top agencies to reflect federal character against the backdrop of the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nature of Nigeria, they urged the President to ensure that the sensibilities of the people were respected and reflected in federal appointments.\n\nWhile affirming the commitment of the peoples of Southern Nigeria to \u201cthe unity of the country on the basis of fairness, equity and oneness,\u201d the governors expressed grave concern about the security challenge plaguing the country and charged the President to act decisively to address the situation.\n\nSpecifically, the governors of the southern states called on President Buhari to convoke a national conference to address the insecurity and other challenges in order to restore the confidence of the citizens in the Nigerian geo-political entity.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said that the southern governors \u201cobserved that incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security.\u201d\n\nBut the federal government responded, saying the southern governors\u2019 proposed plan to enforce the ban on open grazing \u201cis of questionable legality.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it\u2019s seeking clarification on circumstances of arrest\n\n\u2022Kenya denies involvement in capture\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe British Government yesterday refused to categorically accept or deny allegations that it assisted the leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, with another passport after he escaped from Nigeria.\n\nKanu was first arrested in Nigeria on October 14, 2015, following campaigns for the Sovereign State of Biafra and arraigned for treason. He was granted bail in April 2017 but fled the country. The IPOB leader was rearrested last Sunday in an unnamed country and returned to court to continue his trial.\n\nTHISDAY, in a series of email exchanges with the British High Commission in Abuja, had requested clarifications on how the IPOB leader obtained fresh British passport.\n\nIn the most recent email, THISDAY enquired: \u201cWe need some further clarification, please. Are you saying the British government did not assist Mr. Nnamdi Kanu in procuring a new British passport? The information we have is that after escaping from Nigeria through the land borders, the British government assisted him in procuring another passport in the High Commission of one of our neighbouring countries, knowing at the time he was a fugitive running away from justice in Nigeria. Do you categorically deny the British government involvement in this? In relation to (b), are you implying that since Mr. Kanu\u2019s trial was not in a British court, you do not reckon with the Nigerian court which impounded his passports?\u201d\n\nIn reaction, the High Commission said in order to respond to the question, it would need to send the email to \u201cLondon\u201d because \u201cit does not specially relate to the British High Commission in Nigeria unlike the question you clarified yesterday and which we have answered.\u201d\n\nDean Hurlock of the British High Commission, after referring the enquiry to \u201cLondon\u201d, sent the reply yesterday and it read: \u201cWe are seeking clarification about the circumstances of the arrest from the Nigerian government. Our policy on issuing passports to those who are entitled to them is clear and publicly available; we are not going to discuss any individual case.\u201d\n\nOf course, the reply did not address the issues raised by THISDAY. Kanu could not have obtained a new British passport without the approval of the British Government.\n\nIn the earlier email, THISDAY enquired from the British High Commission: \u201cThe specific allegation we want addressed is whether the British High Commission assisted Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, whose Nigerian and British passports had been impounded by an Abuja court, in jumping bail by issuing him another British passport which he used to travel out of Nigeria and had been using to travel until his re-arrest. How could Kanu have acquired another British travel document in Nigeria without processing it at your High Commission?\u201d\n\nJonathan Bacon of the British High Commission replied saying the question refers explicitly to British High Commission and that his response earlier directly addressed this allegation: \u201cWe can confirm that the British High Commission in Nigeria did not issue any travel documents for Mr Kanu. We therefore reaffirm the categorical denial sent to you yesterday. Your question (b) referred to London, hence my reply yesterday at 17:23 to say that I needed to ask London for a view on the question, and that given the time the email was sent, I might not receive a reply until the morning.\u201d\n\nKenya Denies Involvement in Arrest, Repatriation of Kanu\n\nMeanwhile, Kenya High Commissioner to Nigeria, Ambassador Wilfred Machage has denied the involvement of his government in the arrest and extradition of the IPOB leader.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, had said the IPOB leader was \u201cintercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services abroad\u201d, but he did not disclose the country where Kanu was arrested.\n\nKanu\u2019s family later alleged that the IPOB leader was arrested in Kenya with the aid of the Kenyan government and returned to Nigeria. Some publications also reported that the Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was privy to Kanu\u2019s extradition.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Machage, dismissed all the allegations and challenged anyone with evidence linking his country to the incident to produce it.\n\nHe described as \u201cunfortunate and libelous\u201d the linking of President Kenyatta to Kanu\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe Kenyan High Commissioner said the allegation was \u201cconcocted\u201d to pitch Nigerians in the South-east against Kenyans.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved in the alleged arrest in Kenya and extradition to Nigeria of Mr. Kanu. To us, therefore, these allegations are fictional, imaginary, and deliberately concocted to fuel antagonistic feelings among a certain section of the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cI want to challenge anyone with facts relating to this alleged arrest in Kenya to present those facts. This includes when, where, how, and who was particularly involved in the alleged arrest.\n\n\u201cI wish to categorically state that we are not happy at this ridiculous attempt at dragging the name of Kenya and President Uhuru Kenyatta in this matter of arrest and extradition of the self-proclaimed IPOB leader.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a sovereign country. It\u2019s your country. Instead of facing the Kenyan High Commission in Nigeria to ask some of these questions, you should face your government. The government of Nigeria knows how they arrested him. They have the answers, not me.\u201d\n\nHe said the government and people of Kenya were also \u201cdisturbed, dismayed and astonished by the unfortunate statement on the alleged arrest of Kanu in Kenya.\u201d\n\nMachage added: \u201cThe Government of Kenya is particularly appalled by the spurious, derogatory, and libelous mention of our dear President on this matter as has been reported.\n\n\u201cI, as the High Commissioner of the Republic of Kenya to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, wish to categorically emphasise that our country, Kenya, continues to enjoy cordial diplomatic relations with both the Federal Government of Nigeria and its great accommodating and amiable citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Kenya \u201cis committed to sustaining the historical bond of friendship between the two countries and further cement diplomatic relations with the view to ensuring beneficial relations.\u201d\n\nHe urged that Kenya should not be dragged into the issue as she has no question to answer but rather that the citizens of Nigeria should approach the Nigerian government for an explanation of where Kanu was arrested.\n\nLast Thursday, Kenya\u2019s Director-General of Immigration Services, Alexander Muteshi, also dismissed the claim that Kanu was arrested in his country.\n\nWhile on the run, Kanu piloted the affairs of IPOB from abroad, and after his re-arrest, the federal government arraigned him before the Federal High Court in Abuja, where a judge granted the Department of State Services (DSS) permission to keep him in its custody until July 26 when his trial would continue. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Machage, dismissed all the allegations and challenged anyone with evidence linking his country to the incident to produce it.\n\nHe described as \u201cunfortunate and libelous\u201d the linking of President Kenyatta to Kanu\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe Kenyan High Commissioner said the allegation was \u201cconcocted\u201d to pitch Nigerians in the South-east against Kenyans.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved in the alleged arrest in Kenya and extradition to Nigeria of Mr. Kanu.

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nSenator Kabir Marafa, a leader of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has described the defection of Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle to the APC, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as a violation of the Supreme Court judgment, which declared that the APC had no candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Zamfara State.\n\nThe lawmaker of the Eight Senate in an interview on ARISE News, warned that if strong reservations expressed by the party members over the defection were not managed properly, they might snowball into a major crisis that would rock the very foundation of the party.\n\nJustifying his opposition to Matawalle\u2019s defection, Marafa stated: \u201cThe judgment made by the Supreme Court said APC ought not to have participated in the 2019 election. What that means is that there was no APC at all. Now, I\u2019m asking this question and I want every Nigerian to tell me: Can a man that is non-existent give birth to children? No, he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGiving further clarifications on the Supreme Court judgment, Marafa said, \u201cAs far as the law is concerned, there was no APC in the 2019 ballot paper, so APC cannot have a governor, APC cannot have senators, APC cannot have members of House of Representatives and APC cannot have members of the state\u2019s house of assembly, according to that Supreme Court judgment.\n\n\u201cSo, any attempt by anybody to say he is the governor of APC, between 2019 and 2023 without reason of death or resignation that could have warranted issues of bye-election, cannot work. Doing so is acting against the judgment of the Supreme Court. You are making nonsense of our judicial system. These issues are going to come up.\u201d\n\nIn what appears to be a sign of cracks in the ranks of the APC in Zamfara, Marafa distanced himself from the defection of the state governor, saying \u201cWe have accepted our fate. We are the ones that fought, we lost and we have accepted that in good fate. \u201cLeave us where we are. You don\u2019t have to rub it on us. Doing so will just ignite series of problems that might spell doom to APC. We don\u2019t want it to happen, so, what people are saying is APC be fair, be just.\u201d\n\nHe also stated why he believes Matawalle should not be the leader of the APC in Zamfara State.\n\nHe insisted that the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the APC, Mai Mala Buni, erred by announcing Matawalle as the leader of the party in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cAPC should let the sleeping dog lie. Mai Mala Buni, Chairman of its Caretaker Committee doesn\u2019t have the power under the constitution to make such pronouncements,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Some might say I am biased, having spent most of my political career in the legislature. And they will be right,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the fact remains that by design, it is only the legislator that has the constitutional obligation to come to work each day and advocate for the interests of the people on whose behalf we serve.\n\n\u201cThis is both a high honour and a heavy responsibility. And I am pleased that at this time in our nation\u2019s history, we have as presiding officers of parliament across the country, capable people who recognise the importance of this moment and are equal to the task of nation-building at this critical time.\n\n\u201cIn governance, there is a role for the legislature. Unfortunately, in our clime, and perhaps in most climes, the role of the legislature is often conflicted and bungled together to include the role of the judiciary, the role of the executive, and even the role of a private organisation.\n\n\u201cWe have to play all these roles as legislators. What I find solace in is the fact that this misconception and misunderstanding of the role of the legislature is a worldwide phenomenon. It is universal, and it is not peculiar to Nigeria alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u200bAs legislators, our ability to do what is required of us in this joint task of nation-building depends, in some measure, on how well we can work together within the federal legislature, and across the legislatures of the 36 states.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila added that when the federal lawmakers finish working on the documents on the constitution review, the national assembly will send copies of it to the state houses of assembly for their input.",

Unfortunately, in our clime, and perhaps in most climes, the role of the legislature is often conflicted and bungled together to include the role of the judiciary, the role of the executive, and even the role of a private organisation.\n\n\u201cWe have to play all these roles as legislators. What I find solace in is the fact that this misconception and misunderstanding of the role of the legislature is a worldwide phenomenon. It is universal, and it is not peculiar to Nigeria alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u200bAs legislators, our ability to do what is required of us in this joint task of nation-building depends, in some measure, on how well we can work together within the federal legislature, and across the legislatures of the 36 states.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila added that when the federal lawmakers finish working on the documents on the constitution review, the national assembly will send copies of it to the state houses of assembly for their input.",

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "FairMoney, like many other Nigerian fintechs, started out in the lending business and is about completing its evolution into being a full-fledged digital bank.\n\nToday it announced a $42 million Series B round. It was led by Tiger Global Management with existing investors like DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest participating.\n\nThe investment comes after FairMoney raised $11 million Series A two years ago and $16 million in total within its first four years.\n\nFor Tiger Global which led the round, this is its fourth investment in an African startup after iRoko (2013), Takealot (2014) and Flutterwave (2021). Notably, this is the first time the investment firm is investing in two African startups within a year. A sign of its renewed interest in the African continent after a long hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,\u201d Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement. \u201cWe were impressed by the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale.\u201d\n\nFairMoney\u2019s Performance\n\nFounded in 2017 by Laurin Hainy, Matthieu Gendreau, and Nicolas Berthozat, FairMoney started its operations in Nigeria before expanding to India last year.\n\nFrom having a little over 100,000 users in its first year of operation, FairMoney has grown to have 1.3 million unique users who have made more than 6.5 million loan applications. Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million.\n\nWithin the short time its being in India, the company has processed more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users.\n\nThis year, FairMoney achieved one of its crucial goals by acquiring a microfinance bank license in Nigeria. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.\n\nLooking forward\n\nComing off a fantastic 2020, the company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans this year. It\u2019ll finance this by raising bonds.\n\nFairMoney has come a long way since it started as a credit provider, it\u2019s ambition according to co-founder Laurin Hainy is that \u201cby the end of the year, its customers will have a full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a number of additional services including savings, stock trading, and crypto-trading products. These are subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWith this new funding, rather than expanding into other countries, FairMoney wants to focus and consolidate its position in Nigeria and India. While it\u2019s not expanding further geographically, its talent pool is, with about 150 open positions.\n\nFairMoney is not alone in its ambitions to dominate the Neobank scene in Nigeria, Kuda in March raised $25 million.\n\nWith more players coming onto the Neobank scene in Nigeria, one might get a feel that it\u2019s a space that\u2019s getting crowded but the fact that about 56% of Nigerian adults are unbanked hints that there\u2019s room for many to play in this space.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor two children to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand.

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "A group of friends hit the Cubana Lounge in Port Harcourt for Thank God It\u2019s Friday (TGIF). Hours later and a few bottles of Moet and Ciroc gulped, the bill is settled. Five percent of the total amount, as of 2019, was remitted as Value Added Tax (VAT) to the Federal Government. This was subsequently shared among the three tiers of government. That year (2019), N150.24billion worth of alcohol was consumed in Nigeria and VAT amounted to N7.5billion.\n\nIn Kano, Jigawa, Yobe, Zamfara, or any of the 12 Sharia states in Nigeria, those alcoholic drinks are frequently confiscated when found and destroyed. But, it doesn\u2019t stop them from sharing in the revenue that accrues from the same alcoholic beverages sold elsewhere in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of a range of datasets has shown, for perhaps the first time, that the Sharia states are allocated 30.26 percent of revenue from alcohol sold all over Nigeria, whereas they account for as expected, a meagre 2.92 percent of consumption. In many cases, Sharia states got more revenue than non-Sharia states where alcohol was actually sold and consumed.\n\n\u201cPeople are benefitting from what they consider to be illegal,\u201d said Emmanuel Ijewere, who in 1991 was chairman of the committee set up by the military regime of Ibrahim Babaginda to conceptualize the introduction of VAT in Nigeria.\n\nIjewere told BusinessDay his committee had recommended that VAT, which was to replace sales tax, be aggregated every month then each state given its own money, less 5 percent as administrative cost. However, politicians within the regime scuttled the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe idea of VAT was to replace sales tax in states,\u201d said Ijewere and, \u201cany aspect that is illegalized, the tax will not be collected for those and the state can\u2019t benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Shamsudeen Yusuf, an Islamic Law lecturer at the Al-Qalam University in Katsina, sharing money from gambling or alcohol is allowed since it is a national allocation by virtue of being part of \u2018One Nigeria\u2019. But, the Muslim state should not directly collect that tax or even allow that investment to take place inside its state.\n\nIslam forbids alcohol because it can distort the mental capability of a person, and for 12 states in Nigeria where Sharia law is in place, keeping alcohol out of their domain has been religiously enforced.\n\nTwo main data sets were employed for analysis; the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) disbursement reports for 2019 and the Consumption-Expenditure Pattern in Nigeria report for 2019, published in May 2020, both from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The detailed methodology is presented later in the article.\n\nIt does not matter how much alcohol is destroyed in Kano, or any of the other Sharia states; their revenue is guaranteed. As long as consumers in the other 24 states (and FCT) keep gulping gin, beer, or vodka non-stop, taxes will drop into government coffers faster than merry-seekers can refill their cups.\n\nOversight or illogical allocations?\n\n\u201cAlcohol is prohibited in Islam, so there should be no taxes from it since it is haram, that is, prohibited,\u201d said Iysa Bello, a professor of Islamic Law.\n\n\u201cWhatever is haram, whatever accrues from it will be haram too,\u201d emphasized Bello, who is head, Department of Common and Islamic Law, Osun State University.\n\nTo demonstrate how prohibited alcohol is, in November 2020, the Kano state government destroyed thousands of beer bottles valued at over N200 million. In that ceremony, the government emphasized that consumption of beer in all parts of the state is banned.\n\nRead also: New Digital Tax: Protecting the Nigerian dataspace (II)\n\nA year earlier, Kano received N280million as its share of taxes accruing from alcohol in Nigeria, more than the N200million worth of alcohol it destroyed at once.\n\nA distributor, John Simon, told Punch in an interview that he lost N35million because of what the Kano state government did. \u201cWhere will I source the money to continue selling beer?\u201d he said.\n\nKano, like other Sharia states, is guaranteed hundreds of millions of naira by a revenue-sharing formula indifferent to whether the income source is illegal based on religious practices or local laws. Though bought, consumed, and taxed elsewhere, states that ban these goods still get their cut, in many cases, even more than those responsible for the sales.\n\nAssuming each state received all the taxes charged on alcohol consumed without sharing a kobo with the federal government. This, for example, means Kano would have got N6.7million in 2019, from the 5 percent tax charged on the N134million worth of drinks it is estimated the state consumed. Instead, it got N280million from the national pool of VAT on alcohol, 42 times more than what it would have earned.\n\nConversely, even though Anambra consumed N13.5billion worth of alcohol in the same year, it ended up with N153million in VAT on alcohol. If Anambra were to receive its alcohol VAT directly, the state would have pocketed N678million; more than four times what it ended up with.\n\nIt gets even more interesting. The Sharia states of Borno, Jigawa, Katsina, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara consumed zero naira worth of alcohol, according to NBS data.\n\nYet, each state not only benefited from VAT accruing from alcohol sales across Nigeria but also in some cases, got more revenue than states where billions of naira worth of alcohol were consumed.\n\nFor instance, while Borno was not captured at all by the NBS consumption expenditure report, because \u201csecurity issues prevented collecting a representative sample,\u201d by getting 2.49 percent of VAT allocations for 2019, its share from alcohol sold that year would be N158million. Whereas, it would have been zero revenue if the principle of earning by sales were to truly apply.\n\nFurthermore, Jigawa, Katsina, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara all had zero alcohol sales recorded, at least officially. Yet, alcohol VAT accruable to these states was N166million (2.6 percent of VAT), N194million (3.05 percent), N145million (2.28 percent), N118million (1.85 percent), and N122million (1.92 percent) respectively.\n\nZamfara, the birthplace of Sharia in Nigeria, with its revenue of N122million from alcohol taxes got more than Bayelsa, where N8.1billion worth of alcohol was consumed but the state ended up with N93million in revenue, even when it could have earned four times more (N409million) directly.\n\nThe Sharia states have for 22 years since they adopted that law, been bingeing heavily on alcohol taxes, even when the intoxicating substance is banned from being sold in their domains. When found, alcohol consignments are destroyed. Loss of revenue is the least of worries for those caught during such operations by Hisbah; the religious police.\n\nHowever, minute as it may be, a portion of state revenue used to pay salaries of the Hisbah officials, and other social amenities they enjoy like the rest of society, come from revenue accruing from alcohol taxes.\n\nPiecing the data together\n\nGetting data was always tricky, and for years, it was a mystery if and what Nigeria\u2019s Sharia states benefited from banned goods such as alcohol. Finding what each state earned from VAT, one of the main variables, was easy. This was to be calculated as a percentage of alcohol consumption, which was the elusive part.\n\nIn Nigeria, Value Added Tax was first introduced in 1993. Though the current VAT rate became effective in February 2020, this article uses data for 2019, hence, calculates VAT based on 5 percent, the previous rate.\n\nVAT is centrally collected \u2018on behalf\u2019 of all the states in Nigeria, and shared monthly based on a formula that gives the Federal Government 15 percent, States share 50 percent and Local Governments share the balance of 35 percent.\n\nTwo main data sets are employed; the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) disbursement reports for 2019 and the Consumption-Expenditure Pattern in Nigeria report published in May 2020, both from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe FAAC reports, analyzed for every month in 2019, showed how much each state got as VAT and the corresponding percentage. Also, disbursements disaggregated by Local Government Areas were summed in giving a total view of disbursements to each State.\n\nThe Consumption-Expenditure report, on the other hand, gave a first-of-its-kind insight into how much Nigerians spend on different goods. What they spent on alcohol was used to determine the value for VAT on alcohol.\n\nSubsequently, each state\u2019s percentage share of total VAT allocation was plugged into the alcohol VAT value to determine what each state was getting from alcohol sales.\n\nIf all that was hopefully, not fuzzy, complete data sets can also be viewed here.\n\nHow does it end?\n\nIshaq Akintola, a professor of Islamic Eschatology and founder, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), usually very vocal on Islamic topics in Nigeria, declined comment on whether or not it is appropriate for Sharia states to benefit from alcohol taxes.\n\nThis is because \u201cthere is no Sharia in the southwest, the Christians don\u2019t allow us to practice our Allah-given fundamental human rights, so we don\u2019t know what obtains anywhere else\u201d.\n\nHe said only Islamic scholars from states where Sharia is being practiced can comment on it.\n\nBut, is it possible for Sharia states to indicate they do not want alcohol and other forbidden taxes included in what is shared with them monthly?\n\nYusuf, at the Al-Qalam University, reiterated that to the extent it is national allocation, Sharia states could accept alcohol taxes. For Kano to share its revenue with Lagos for instance, but not collect from Lagos (say, because of alcohol), it will be injustice, he said.\n\nOn the other hand, Bello, who has taught Islamic law for decades, sighed deeply and responded, \u201cIt is possible for the state to do that (i.e. reject alcohol taxes), and an Islamic state should actually do that. But if the Federal Government is going to agree is another thing. Even if they agree, executing is another thing.\u201d\n\nWho will take the first step to redress what could be an injustice, but certainly a moral dilemma in Nigeria\u2019s VAT sharing, is yet to be seen. Appropriateness of the general revenue-sharing methodology is yet another story.",

          "title": "Microblogging and the Nigerian State: Matters Arising",
          "text": "The Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of the use of Twitter, a microblogging platform has resurfaced questions around the growth of information technology and how it can best be deployed for the greater good of the many.\n\nThe vice president, Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) recently declared that the Nigerian government is ready to introduce a new mechanism to widen the tax net.\n\nThis mechanism involves the collection of taxes on the Nigerian income of global technology giants not based in the country, but with significant economic presence. According to Section 4 of the Finance Act 2019, \u201cthe finance minister, may by the order of the president, determine what constitutes the significant economic presence of a company other than a Nigerian company\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian government is set to utilize this legal provision by taxing profits made in the country by global technology and digital firms such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, among others.\n\nOver the years, efforts have been made to widen the tax net, including the creation of the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), which was an attempt to bring more people into the tax net, and hiking the VAT rate from 5.0 percent to 7.5 percent.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban will stifle digital ecosystem\n\nNotably, total tax revenue increased by 59.1 percent to N5.3 trillion between 2016 and 2019. However, due to COVID-19 and the resultant effects on the economy, tax revenues declined by 5.8 percent to N4.9tn in 2020, driving an urgent need to broaden the tax base.\n\nThe storm and the teacup\n\nThe problem of the power of social media, as a product of private enterprise, remains a prickly global issue as governments\u2019 worldwide struggle to establish the balance between individual rights and social responsibility.\n\nWhile governments have been accused of muzzling free speech, social media entrepreneurs commit the same offence with less or no public outrage.\n\nOn Friday, June 04, 2021, at about 04:34 PM (WAT) the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) through the minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of the use of Twitter in Nigeria. The announcement first appeared on the ministry\u2019s Twitter handle @FMICNigeria and cited the use of the platform for activities that were capable of undermining the country\u2019s corporate existence as a reason for the suspension.\n\nHowever, Nigerians generally believed that the government responded to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by the Nigerian President where he was alleged to have threatened violence against a section of the country.\n\nThe President was alleged to have responded to the violence erupting in parts of the country by saying on June 01, 2021, that: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThis statement was believed by Twitter managers to be inappropriate and breached the company\u2019s policy on acceptable speech on its platform. In a swift reaction to the company\u2019s decision to delete the Nigerian President\u2019s tweet on its platform, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Information directed the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT (Over the Top) and social media operations in Nigeria and suspend the operations and use of Twitter in the country.\n\nRead Also: Digital entrepreneurship: a \u2018diamond in the rough\u2019 for SMEs in Nigeria\n\nLater that week, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) confirmed that its members had received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the sector regulator, to suspend access to Twitter, while the attorney-general of the Federation (AGF) and minister of justice, Abubakar Malami had reportedly issued a statement ordering the prosecution of violators of the Twitter suspension order in Nigeria insisting that users of the platform would be prosecuted.\n\nThe presumption that social media is a socially and politically neutral platform for societal conversation is false. Owners of microblogging platforms have recognizable biases that range from the innocuous to the sinister and these biases could have severe consequences for social and political stability in different parts of the world.\n\nFrontier and emerging market economies appear to face the blunt force trauma of the biases of owners of microblogging platforms more powerfully than more mature countries.\n\nMore recently one of the most publicized battles with a social media platform was the bust-up between the United States of America\u2019s President Donald Trump and Twitter in which the social media platform banned the US President from using its platform to tweet until 2023.\n\nThe action of Twitter to bar the then US President inspired several global conversations over the power social media wielded and the capacity of the owners of social media to use it to shape the public conversation, perception, and action.\n\nWhile the Twitter ban could be seen as putting the US President in check over what generally were considered incendiary tweets, it showed that private enterprises managing social media platforms could wield enormous power over what societies consider acceptable or unacceptable speech or conduct, it hands such institutions a sword that could swing both ways.\n\nIt is this inherent capacity of social media enterprises to sway collective opinion and subtly affect people\u2019s decisions that make social media institutions as dangerous as they are liberating.\n\nNo Time for Excuses\n\nBe this as it may, the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s action to suspend microblogging platform Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was precipitated and clever by half.\n\nA local Nigerian adage says that the answer to a headache is not cutting off the head. The answer to Twitter\u2019s removal of a Nigerian Presidential Tweet that did not comply with the company\u2019s governance guidance should certainly not have been the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nIndeed, by the suspension, the government has highlighted its intolerance and its tendency to act before introspection, both characteristics unbefitting of an administration that claims to respect citizens\u2019 rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria conflicts with Chapter 2 section 22 of the Nigerian 1999 constitution as amended in 2011. The section declares that \u201cThe press, radio, television and other agencies of the mass media shall at all times be free to uphold the fundamental objectives contained in this Chapter and uphold the responsibility and accountability of the Government to the people\u201d.\n\nMicroblogs are channels by which media platforms hold governments accountable and so suspending such microblogs goes against the spirit of the country\u2019s constitution which guarantees citizen\u2019s access to information.\n\nConcerns about national security are valid but they must be viewed within the wider context of balancing national security interests with the rights of citizens to information. So far, this has been a delicate global trapeze trick. However, governments cannot use this as an excuse to plug the mouths and stop the keyboards of subscribers to social media.\n\nThe Twitter Red herring\n\nThe Twitter saga is an unfortunate diversion from major social issues such as the wantoning killing of Nigerians across the federation by marauding herdsmen. The killing of almost 50 citizens in Oyo state, another 100 citizens in Benue state, 3 citizens in Ogun state and 10 in Kaduna state within forty-eight (48) hideous hours camouflages behind the issue of a Twitter suspension.\n\nHowever, both issues are tangentially linked. Microblogging platforms provide Nigerians with up-to-the-minute information on human carnage going on across the country. The social media tool enables citizens to weigh national insecurity and the nature and effectiveness of the government\u2019s response.\n\nThe threat to Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence is not Twitter but the government\u2019s refusal to frontally address the issue of insecurity. The fact that the government wants to wish Twitter away does not resolve the existential challenge of a rampaging band of terrorists unleashing asymmetric war on the country.\n\nRather than spend time squandering local and international goodwill in fighting an obscure and relatively unimportant battle with Twitter, the federal government would do well to address the Goliath knocking the breath out of its credibility.\n\nThose celebrating the action as a show of might by Nigeria over a global tech giant are either naive, short-sighted or both. Nigeria and Nigerians would be better served if the country shows itself to be in control of the safety and livelihoods of its citizens and in control of its territorial borders than flexing muscles with a perceived digital enemy.\n\nA local adage suggests that the federal government has avoided finding an enduring cure for its festering ringworms (security and economic distress) as it casually continues to pick at its pimple (Twitter).\n\nThere is a place for ego and a place for temperance and good choices, Nigeria needs to shun the former and embrace the latter. Both physical security and enterprise security are of greater strategic importance than bruised tweets. The earlier the administration stops throwing red herrings the faster it can get to work on addressing Nigeria\u2019s more pressing problems.\n\nIn the light of these facts, BusinessDay analysts are of the opinion that, given the local reach of the technology giants, the mechanism can potentially yield some results \u2013 increasing the revenue contribution from tax and easing the burden on public debt. However, taking into account the recent Twitter ban, this may send unfriendly policy signals to foreign technology businesses and may have negative implications for already weak FDI flows.\n\nWe recommend that the government focuses more on the underlying causes of the country\u2019s weak tax base and implement policies to improve the ease of doing business, support business growth and attract foreign investors, which strengthens the tax base.",
          "summary": "While governments have been accused of muzzling free speech, social media entrepreneurs commit the same offence with less or no public outrage.\nHowever, Nigerians generally believed that the government responded to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by the Nigerian President where he was alleged to have threatened violence against a section of the country.\nThe presumption that social media is a socially and politically neutral platform for societal conversation is false.\nIt is this inherent capacity of social media enterprises to sway collective opinion and subtly affect people\u2019s decisions that make social media institutions as dangerous as they are liberating.\nHowever, governments cannot use this as an excuse to plug the mouths and stop the keyboards of subscribers to social media.",

          "title": "Oil region experts, leaders welcome PIB with cautious optimism",
          "text": "News of the historic passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (wholesome) since the past 20 years in the Senate on Thursday, July 1, 2021, has swept through the oil region with cautious optimism, but experts and leaders in the region have shown worry over what they call implementation shakedowns that often ruin good programmes in Nigeria.\n\nWhereas popular opinion insists on the 10 percent demanded by the south-south governors, industry insiders however, fear that the 3 percent is huge burden on the operational budget of oil companies and could serve as disincentive to investment in an era when the industry has for decades chased away investments.\n\nThe general consensus however, is that it is better to get the law going so that the good aspects can kick off while amendments can come later. It is good to operate the law and see how it goes, they say.\n\nIn the industry, the consensus seems to be that the region has no choice, nor luxury of time not to accept this. A source said: \u201cCrude is almost gone, oil companies at global level are transforming to energy companies, fossil oil is gone, gas has about a decade to flourish. So, no time for good or bad PIB. The consensus is that we run with this so as to exploit the much we can before we totally lose out and the PIB is the only way to allow private capital to come in.\n\nOthers say host community aspect is the most sensitive but that the 3 percent from every oil company\u2019s capital budget (capex) is better than nothing. \u201cRemember one percent on same capex already goes to the NDDC, one percent of contracts goes to Nigerian Content Board, FG remits to NDDC, 13 percent overall revenue goes to states, all GMOUs remittances go to Cluster Boards, etc. We can manage with these for now, if local accountability is there,\u201d they said.\n\nThey argue that the real gain is in freeing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to be a regulator while another national oil company will be an investor or operator. Now, the Minister is to have less interference in direct management of oil but still has huge powers in some areas. \u201cWe can always amend it along the journey, but it\u2019s good to start, after 20 years,\u201d they further said.\n\nSome say the government is simply passing the buck as it has the responsibility to develop the areas where its revenues come from.\n\nJoe Olobari (Ex-SPDC staff)\n\nThe devil is in the detail. While it seems a major win for host communities, the success or failure of the initiative lies in the modalities for administering such funds on a community to community basis.\n\nAs one who has been in the industry and one from a community in the Niger Delta, I have seen communities torn apart by mere expectations. Often, they turn round to blame the intervener.\n\nThis is critical because the 3 percent sliced off operators\u2019 budget to NDDC has had questionable success, for lack of a better expression.\n\nFrom the industry perspective, an additional three percent from the capex of each operator is quite a dip in investable fund in a region that is fast becoming less attractive.\n\nIt simply raises the cost of production of a barrel! You cannot do that when at the same time you are driving low production cost. It does appear that there is some disconnect with the realities of the industry. Or the\n\nThe Senate may be simply shying away from making government judiciously use funds for the development of communities from where the revenue it spends is derived.\n\nRead also: Oil rises near $69 as OPEC sees demand picking up\n\nEladebi Kingsley Egbuson (Economist)\n\n(Eguson is the current GM of Bayelsa Plastic Industry. He had worked at Business Development Capacity in Century Group known as CESL, and also in Belema Oil.)\n\nThe three per cent for host community is good enough for a start to test the waters. This is a taxation on oil firms; and it adds to the cost of Petroleum Profit Tax. The incident of taxation is predictable when it is a burden on the entrepreneur. Looking at PPT (Petroleum profit tax)\n\nIt is a tax on the income of companies engaged in upstream petroleum operations in lieu of CIT.\n\nAnother problem to arise from this three per cent which is not enough as agitated by the South-South representatives is how much of these communities are defined as host communities. Oil fields span across community frontiers. And where the flare or wells are located are just pin holes that drain from reservoirs that are large underneath several communities. Did the definition of host communities cater for such radius and effects as enormous as the environment apart from where the oil well is located?\n\nFor example, 51 percent of gas for Bonny LNG comes from Bayelsa, but is the host community definition in the bill catering for the gas drain from other states? Or do the gas installations in associated oil wells sufficient to define host communities in the PIB? I foresee increasing hostilities to this bill.\n\nLeesi Gborogbosi (CEO, Gabriel Domale Consulting)\n\n(Gborogbosi heads a Management Consulting Firm, and is an expert in finance, strategy, corporate governance, cost reduction, transformation and collaboration between host communities and oil companies)\n\nDr Leesi\n\nThe problem with politicians is that they never consult their people and the experts that they have. Participation by host communities should be based on total budget and not on budget class \u2013 because that will give room for flexibility by oil companies to their advantage.\n\nWhy are host communities given three per cent and not a minimum of 15 percent?\n\nWe are no more in the era of corporate social responsibilities of companies providing community projects. We are now in an era where host communities want to become strategic partners. They want to participate in the value chain of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIf the desire for stakeholders in the oil industry is to develop the oil and gas host communities, then the host communities must be given the preference and nurtured into full participation in the value generation and resource management in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThis is the time for collaborative relationship between host communities and oil companies.\n\nAs we continue to ignore host communities, we deliberately institutionalise non-collaborative behaviour.\n\nMany show the Indorama-Eleme Petrochemicals model as a success model to copy but in the company\u2019s supply chain, how many Eleme persons are driving trucks or in the trucking business?\n\nThey are not participating in the value chain \u2013 the supply chain.\n\nDarlington Nwauju (Spokesperson, Niger Delta Rights Advocates, NDRA\n\nOn the bright side of the passage of the five chapters & 319 paragraphs PIB, the regime of losses recorded in the industry will be checked. Records captured by the industry\u2019s anti-corruption agent, NEITI shows that\n\n$10.4billion or more has been lost to under remittances by IOCs due to lack of a structured governance framework in the Oil and Gas industry.\n\nAgain, the three per cent holder equity for the direct development of oil bearing communities is encouraging even though we would have wished for at least 5percent of such funds to help quicken the regeneration of the devastated Niger Delta environment.\n\nNext, the approval of 30 percent for the development of other frontiers will in no mean way awaken business opportunities and stimulate the local economy.\n\nOn the other hand, with the unbundling of the NNPC into a full business entity, market forces in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors will now determine prices and promote legal competition and activities that will trigger business opportunities. The implication of this of course is that prices of fossil fuel, domestic gas, DPK, AGO will certainly go high.\n\nThe NDRA therefore draws attention of the Executive to the likelihood of a spike in the prices of goods and services and government must therefore be proactive in the provision of palliative measures to mitigate large scale suffering of the masses.\n\nFinally, today\u2019s passage of the PIB also brings to an end 18years of wastage of tax payers\u2019 money by expenditure on consultations and retreats by the National Assembly over the Bill.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is clear that with heavy awareness programme and steady communication system to explain the PIB provisions and with clear plans of seamless implementation, the bill and the law that follow would sell in the oil region. But, if conflict entrepreneurs get into the saddle ahead, the Bill may encounter community hitches.",

          "title": "Constitution Review: Gbajabiamila seeks collaboration between NASS, state assemblies",
          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has called for collaboration between the National Assembly and the 36 state Houses of Assembly on the ongoing constitution review.\n\nHe said the collaboration was necessary to make the review of the 1999 Constitution successful.\n\nMr Gbajabiamila, who spoke at a meeting of the Conference of Presiding Officers of Nigerian Legislatures (COPON) in Abuja on Saturday, harped on the need for collaboration.\n\nThe National Assembly is currently reviewing the 1999 constitution.\n\nEvery proposed amendment must get the approval two-third of the 36 state legislatures before it is forwarded to the president for assent.\n\nMr Gbajabiamila also stated that the legislature remained the most important arm of government in any democratic setting.\n\nHe added that the federal legislators are \u201cusing the constitutional amendment process to address the foundational deficiencies in our constitution that continue to mitigate against the attainment of an honourable, peace and universal prosperity in our country.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said once the National Assembly \u201cwas done with its part, it would forward the constitution review document to state Houses of Assembly for their constitutional inputs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat process of constitutional review cannot succeed without strategic collaboration between all of us who are here today.\n\n\u201cSo, I ask of you that we take the opportunity of this conference to agree on the things we wish to achieve so that we can begin now to devise the strategies through which we can achieve our objectives,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Gbajabiamila said by virtue of its roles, which included coming together to protect the interests of the diverse people in the country, the legislature had a more direct and immediate connection with the people at the grassroots.\n\nThe speaker, who has been in the House since 2003, also raised the issue of the conflicting role of the legislative arm, noting the lawmakers must remain steadfast.\n\n\u201cIn governance, there is a role for the Legislature. Unfortunately in our clime, and perhaps in most climes, the role of the Legislature is often conflicted and bungled together to include the role of the Judiciary, the role of the Executive, and even the role of a private organisation.\n\n\u201cWe have to play all these roles as legislators. What I find solace in is the fact that this misconception and misunderstanding of the role of the Legislature is a worldwide phenomenon. It is universal, and it is not peculiar to Nigeria alone.\n\n\u201c\u200bI believe that the legislature is the most important arm of the government. Some might say I am biased, having spent most of my political career in the legislature. And they will be right. But the fact remains, that by design, it is only the legislator that has the constitutional obligation to come to work each day and advocate for the interests of the people on whose behalf we serve.\n\n\u201cThis is both a high honour and a heavy responsibility. And I am pleased that at this time in our nation\u2019s history, we have as presiding officers of parliament across the country, capable people who recognise the importance of this moment and are equal to the task of nation-building at this critical time.\u201d\n\nConference\n\nOn the conference, Mr Gbajabiamila said since the last meeting of COPON 12 years ago\u201d\u2026our democracy has changed. We have matured and improved, yet in many important ways, and on many important issues, there is still a lot of work left to do.\n\n\u201c\u200bAs legislators, our ability to do what is required of us in this joint task of nation-building depends, in some measure, on how well we can work together within the federal legislature, and across the legislatures of the thirty-six states.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT",
          "summary": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has called for collaboration between the National Assembly and the 36 state Houses of Assembly on the ongoing constitution review.\nHe said the collaboration was necessary to make the review of the 1999 Constitution successful.\nMr Gbajabiamila, who spoke at a meeting of the Conference of Presiding Officers of Nigerian Legislatures (COPON) in Abuja on Saturday, harped on the need for collaboration.\nMr Gbajabiamila also stated that the legislature remained the most important arm of government in any democratic setting.\n\u201cThat process of constitutional review cannot succeed without strategic collaboration between all of us who are here today.",

          "text": "Minister of Information and Culture, Alh Lai Mohammed, on Saturday, denied the alleged diversion of the 2019 election campaign funds for Kwara State All Progressives\n\nCongress (APC).\n\nMohammed broke his silence on the allegation of campaign funds diversion by a cabal, during the commissioning of a new secretariat of the Bashir Bolarinwa-led faction of the APC in the state.\n\nThe minister insisted that he singlehandedly, through family and friends, raised all the funds for the\n\nprosecution of the electioneering campaings in the state, including a House of Representatives by-election for Irepodun/Ekiti/Oke-Ero federal constituency which preceded the 2019 general elections.\n\nMohammed was apparently responding to Governor AbdulRahman\n\nAbdulRazaq\u2019s allegation that a cabal within the state chapter of the party received hundreds of millions of naira as donations for the Kwara \u2018Otoge\u2019\n\nstruggle but did not deliver a kobo to him.\n\nThe minister added that the last membership registration and\n\nrevalidation in the state was a charade, saying that no APC congress would take place in the state until all members are duly registered.\n\nHe said he got the assurance from the acting national chairman of APC,\n\nMai Mala Buni.\n\nAll other speakers at the event, Alh Bashir Bolarinwa, Prof Shuaib AbdulRaheem, a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. AbdulGaniyu Cook-Olododo, a former gubernatorial aspirant, Tajudeen Makama, Akogun Iyiola Oyedepo and a member of the State House of Assembly, Prince Saheed Popoola, corroborated the minister\u2019s claim on the campaign funds and the assurance given them by the national leadership of the APC that congresses will not hold in the state until those left behind in the exercise are registered.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Minister added: \u201cI never diverted APC 2019 general elections campaign funds for my personal use as alleged by Kwara state Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. By the grace of God, I singlehandedly\n\nwith the support of friends and family raised all the monies for the Oke-Ero/Isin/Ekiti/Irepodun federal constituency by-election of November 2018 that brought Hon. Tunji Olawuyi to the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cAnd I challenge anybody here to say he gave the party one penny apart\n\nfrom what I gave them. I challenge anybody here to say he gave\n\nlogistics support to the party. I did that by the grace of God. I distributed 500 motorcycles and 20 vehicles. And many of the beneficiaries are here today.\n\n\u201cI want them to explain to Nigerians about what happened to the N70million that Hon. Olawuyi kept that the governor refused to give us\n\nduring the by-election. But for the grace of God and some friends, there\n\nwould have been no election in November 2018, because when we raised money we gave them but two days before election we could not reach them through their phones again.\n\n\u201cI had to go to friends to raise another N150 million to prosecute\n\nthat election. I remember very well that there are 42 wards in that\n\nconstituency. We thank God today that was the beginning of our success.\n\n\u201cWhen elections proper came, we did not see our governorship candidate.\n\nWe could not wait. I say without any fear of contradictions that by\n\nthe grace of God with the money raised from friends, colleagues and\n\nassociates, we financed the four elections and we scored 100 per cent.\n\n\u201cI remember a governor when we won the first election calling me to\n\nask if it was true we won the by-election. And I told him \u2018yes sir.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u2018I want to apologise to you when you came to me for money they\n\ntold me not to give you money. They told me you are a Lagos politician, that nobody can defeat Saraki.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut then we did not know that God brings more wonder. That is how we\n\nwon all the elections. But they got there today and forget the people\n\nthat put them there. If we did not give money to the party, how did he (the governor) think the party won?\u201d\n\nOn the forthcoming state congresses of the party nationwide, the minister said that: \u201cThe acting national chairman of APC, Mai Mala Buni, has assured us that no congress will take place in Kwara until all our members are registered. And that the congress will be free and fair by the grace of\n\nGod.\u201d",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nA South African court on Saturday agreed to hear ex-president Jacob Zuma\u2019s challenge to a 15-month jail term for failing to attend a corruption hearing.\n\nThe constitutional court had on Tuesday given Zuma 15 months in jail for absconding in February from the inquiry led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Zuma had until the end of Sunday to hand himself in, but on Saturday the court agreed to hear his application, suspending the order.\n\nThe South African Broadcasting Corporation (\u200bSABC) reported that the court will hear his application on July 12.\n\nThe jail sentence was seen as sign of just how far Zuma, once revered as a veteran of the struggle against white minority rule, has fallen since embarking on a presidency beset by multiple sleaze and graft scandals between 2009 and 2018.\n\nHis travails have divided the ruling African National Congress, which cancelled an executive committee meeting over the weekend in order to focus on the ensuing crisis.\n\nThe ex-leader has applied to the court for the sentence to be annulled on the grounds that it is excessive and could expose him to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody is saying please hear me out \u2026 and then we have court that says \u2018OK, we are willing to listen to you\u2019, that\u2019s the kind of justice system people died for in this country,\u201d the Jacob Zuma Foundation said in a statement.\n\nAt his hometown of Nkandla, Zuma, who did not speak to his supporters, wore a black and gold tropical shirt as he walked through the crowd, but no mask.\n\nHe was guarded by men dressed as traditional warriors from his Zulu nation, wearing leopard skins and holding spears with oval ox-hide shields.\n\n\u201cThey can give Zuma 15 months \u2026 or 100 months. He\u2019s not going to serve even one day or one minute of that,\u201d his son Edward Zuma told Reuters at the gathering.\n\n\u201cThey would have to kill me before they put their hands on him.\u201d\n\nIn an application to annul the decision submitted on Friday, Zuma said going to jail \u201cwould put him at the highest risk of death\u201d from the pandemic because he was nearly 80 and has a medical condition.\n\nZuma also called the sentence a \u201cpolitical statement of exemplary punishment\u201d. He has maintained he is the victim of a political witch hunt and that Zondo is biased against him.\n\nZuma gave in to pressure to quit and yield to his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, in 2018, and since then has faced several attempts to bring him to book for alleged corruption during and before his time as president.\n\nThe Zondo Commission is examining allegations that he allowed three Indian-born businessmen, the brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, to plunder state resources and influence policy. He and the brothers, who fled to Dubai after Zuma\u2019s ouster, deny wrongdoing.\n\nZuma also faces a separate court case relating to a $2 billion arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president.\n\n*Reuters/NAN",

          "text": "By Solomon Elusoji\n\nNo, you don\u2019t have to be 19 or below to qualify as a teenage creator on TikTok. You just have to believe in two things: one, that humankind was made for joy; and two, that there is no limit, no rule to the expression of what the French call la gaiet\u00e9.\n\nBehind the roaring success of TikTok globally- the app now has about one billion monthly active users \u2013 are these teenage creators who, incidentally, are also the audience. They shoot and edit and publish a diverse range of video content, from dance routines to lipsyncing lyrics, comedy, motivational excerpts and even doling out technical information.\n\nAnd, since everyone on TikTok is a potential creator, anyone can go viral overnight. Like Khabane Lame, a 21-year-old factory worker in the northern Italian industrial town of Chivasso who lost his job and then, using TikTok\u2019s duet and stitch features, was catapulted to fame.\n\nMany young Nigerians have already jumped on the TikTok train. According to Statista, TikTok was the ninth most popular social media platform in Nigeria, just behind LinkedIn and Telegram, as of the third quarter of 2020. And the future, no doubt, is brighter.\n\nRodney Umeh, a student of the University of Abuja, started making videos on TikTok \u201cjust for the fun of it.\u201d\n\nAnd then his short productions, composed of a waist-twisting dance routine, suspenseful music, sharp transitions and short captions \u2013 started to go viral.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember how I learnt the waist routine,\u201d he told Channels Television, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been using it since my secondary school days. It was on TikTok that I used it for the first time online.\u201d\n\nHis videos have garnered over 10 million likes.\n\n\u201cMy long term plan for TikTok is basically to entertain as many people as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the feeling I get when one of my followers tells me that my videos make his or her day is enough for me. Every other thing is just vibes.\n\nPriscilla Isaac started creating sometime in 2019 and is already one of the biggest local stars. \u201cI love how you can confidently express yourself in 60 seconds via TikTok,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTikTok has given many people confidence and brought out so many talented individuals, and that\u2019s what I love about it.\u201d\n\nBut beyond posting videos of her dance challenges and romantic monologues, she has also found creative ways to monetise TikTok.\n\n\u201cI started taking TikTok seriously when it became the next big social media platform for business owners,\u201d she said. \u201cBelieve it or not, TikTok is the biggest marketing platform in the world. It is competing with Twitter.\n\n\u201cAs a TikTok creator, the app doesn\u2019t pay me directly, but I get paid via promotions and jobs I do for business owners, musicians and brand owners. And I have worked with so many brands, including DSTV.\u201d\n\nNo boundaries\n\nThere are large social media platforms designed to encourage users, as much as possible, to stay within their peculiar walls.\n\nNot TikTok.\n\nTikTokers can link their Instagram and YouTube pages on their profile pages with brand logos displayed. They can easily export videos to WhatsApp and Twitter.\n\nAnd, because of its unique production features, creators routinely shoot and edit videos within the TikTok ecosystem to share natively on other social media platforms.\n\nOne of such creators is Ope Keshinro, who has a keen talent for mimicking outlandish characters.\n\n\u201cIt started during the lockdown,\u201d she told Channels Television. \u201cEveryone was looking for distractions and something to keep mind and body together. If I wasn\u2019t watching a movie, I was on social media.\u201d\n\nOne sunny afternoon, she was scrolling on Twitter when she stumbled on a funny, viral video and thought to recreate it.\n\n\u201cAt that time I didn\u2019t even have a TikTok account, so I had to open one to use the voiceover and that\u2019s where it all started from,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, she shoots and edits all her videos on TikTok. And, while her TikTok audience is growing, her Twitter profile has even done better.\n\nTaking advantage\n\nWhile TikTok is minting new celebrities, established media stars and content creators are also flocking to the platform to get a piece of the viral pie.\n\nCelebrities like Olamide, Korede Bello, Mr Macaroni and Taooma already have substantial TikTok following.\n\nThe platform gives them another format to connect with their fanbase in a different way, and also bring more people into the fold.\n\nFor Ayodele Aguda (Mcshemcomedian), who has been creating comedy skits on Facebook and YouTube since the early 2010s, TikTok was a game-changer.\n\nHe joined in 2019 and started producing short versions of his comedy.\n\n\u201cIn two months, I had gained like two million followers,\u201d he told Channels Television. \u201cIn another six months, I was on like three million. And the content was receiving so much acceptance. So I just kept doing that.\u201d\n\nAs of this month, Ayodele\u2019s videos have been liked over 110 million times. And with more than four million followers, he is one of the most popular TikTok creators in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou can easily go viral on TikTok,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cannot really happen on Instagram. On Instagram, someone has to take up your content. But on TikTok, it will likely go viral.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants to start creating and they don\u2019t know where to start from, I tell them to start from TikTok.\n\n\u201cTikTok is where you are doing something other people are doing and no one will hold you that you are copying. Just take a sound and use it; and if you interpret it better than the person, it will go viral and people will follow you.\u201d\n\nThick skin\n\nDespite its feel-good ambience, like most of the social Internet, TikTok isn\u2019t immune to online abuse and bullying.\n\n\u201cI think the most unexpected comment I have gotten was my first hate comment,\u201d Rodney said. \u201cIt was unexpected at that time cause I was used to the positive comments.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Priscilla expects some negativity whenever she posts a piece of content.\n\n\u201cAs a content creator, we are already aware of people\u2019s bad energy and negative comments,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see them as normal.\n\n\u201cIt was when I first joined TikTok, I was literally afraid of getting bad comments, but no matter the type of content you post, not everyone will agree to it.\u201d\n\nAyodele agreed.\n\n\u201cNow I realise why politicians are not moved by what people say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve read so many comments, good and bad. And I\u2019ve realised that not everyone can be pleased.\u201d\n\nLast May, TikTok said it was launching new tools to combat bullying.\n\n\u201cPeople put their hearts and souls into creating and entertaining on TikTok, and we recognize how discouraging it can feel to receive unkind comments on videos,\u201d TikTok\u2019s Joshua Goodman said. \u201cWe hope this update helps creators feel more empowered over their experience on TikTok.\u201d\n\nFollow the money\n\nIn June, black American TikTok creators went on strike over not being credited and not receiving equal rewards for their creativity.\n\nThere was no evidence that Nigerian TikTokers participated in the action or were even aware, but many complained about not being able to earn directly from their TikTok work.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of plans for TikTok, but it\u2019s not on the agenda now because they don\u2019t pay yet,\u201d Ayodele said.\n\nHe\u2019d rather focus on investing more resources in social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube who pay Nigerian creators.\n\nTikTok has a rolling fund for creators, but it is only available for those based in the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain or Italy.\n\n\u201cTikTok should start appreciating content creators like me,\u201d Priscilla said. \u201cThe app should start paying African creators and if they do so, this is going to be a great thing for us creators.\u201d\n\nFor now, Nigerian super creators rely on third party sponsorships to keep the burgeoning flame alive.\n\n\u2018Tik Tok Won\u2019t Wait\u2019\n\nMost TikTok videos do not require any fancy production equipment, even for stars; although some go heavy once they can afford it.\n\nTo be successful on TikTok, you only need to \u201ckeep it natural and be consistent,\u201d according to Priscilla.\n\n\u201cYou just have to keep creating,\u201d Ayodele offered. \u201cAnd be putting out content. Don\u2019t put anything in your archive and feel it\u2019s not good. Let people tell you whether it is good or not. In fact, people can criticise your content so much and it helps people know you.\u201d\n\nAnd for Ope Keshinro, the star who has equally gained traction on Twitter through her TikTok production, creators shouldn\u2019t wait for the perfect location. \u201cShoot any and everywhere you can. Tiktok won\u2019t wait for you,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery week, new challenges are launched so if you wait to get a fine background you just might miss out lol . . . unless it\u2019s fashion and beauty you\u2019re focused on then that\u2019s understandable because of aesthetics and all. If it\u2019s comedy or any other thing you\u2019re doing, do it fast.\n\n\u201cAlso be creative, think about what makes your own content stand out. Hundreds of creators have most likely done the content you want to do, so think about what would make your own different; it can be your choice of costume, your mannerism or your transitions.\u201d\n\nAnd, very importantly, she added, focus on your lighting.\n\n\u201cYou need to have the perfect lighting,\u201d she said. \u201cRinglights don\u2019t even suffice anymore so you need to find the perfect lighting else the quality of the video comes out poor. The people abroad don\u2019t have this kind of issue, maybe because their sky is brighter? But you\u2019ll hardly see any video with poor quality from a creator overseas.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nDespite its widespread success, TikTok\u2019s future is not cast in stone.\n\nOwned by Chinese company Bytedance, the app has had its troubles with governments across the world. It was almost suspended in the United States during the administration of Donald Trump and the app is banned in Pakistan for promoting \u2018indecent\u2019 content.\n\nIn Nigeria, it has largely escaped attention as the country tightens control on social media amid an indefinite suspension of Twitter.\n\nAnd, government regulation may be an advantage for TikTok. Chinese tech companies have a reputation for sticking to government rules.\n\nBesides, TikTok\u2019s official mission is not freedom or political emancipation, but to \u201cinspire creativity and bring joy.\u201d And, who doesn\u2019t love a good laugh?",

          "title": "Full Throttle: England Boss Southgate Says No Rotation in Euro Quarterfinal with Ukraine",
          "text": "Gareth Southgate said it would be \u201can insult to Ukraine\u201d for England to rotate their lineup due to the possibility of four players missing a potential Euro 2020 semifinal.\n\nPhil Foden, Harry Maguire, Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips would all be ruled out of a last-four encounter against either the Czech Republic or Denmark if they picked up another booking when the Three Lions meet Ukraine in Saturday\u2019s quarterfinal at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium.\n\nEngland are favourites to progress to the final as the highest rank team left in their half of the draw, while they have lost just one of their seven meetings with Ukraine, winning the only previous Euros clash 1-0 in 2012.\n\nHowever, asked by ESPN whether the yellow card situation would affect his team selection against Andriy Shevchenko\u2019s side, Southgate replied:\n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t really understand that rationale. I understand that strategically you might like to do that but I can\u2019t think of a country in the world that would do that for a quarterfinal.\n\n\u201cAnd especially not a country that has only been to three semifinals in its history. No, I think we\u2019ve got to focus on tomorrow. I think it would be a big error for us to be thinking about anything else and I think it would be an insult to Ukraine as well.\n\n\u201cSo, we won\u2019t make any decisions based on yellow cards. We did in the last group game because we knew we had qualified and we had the opportunity to protect Phil within that game because we weren\u2019t sure what was going to happen further on. But now we play to win and we have got to have everybody available.\u201d\n\nThe game kicks off at 9 p.m. local time, but temperatures in the Italian capital are still expected to reach 25-degrees-Celsius.\n\nEngland have habitually struggled to cope with such conditions given their lack of exposure to warmer climes during the domestic season, but Southgate is drawing confidence from their Group D opening win over Croatia at Wembley.\n\nTemperatures in that afternoon match when reached a yearly high in the United Kingdom of 28-degrees-Celsius.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be as hot as the game with Croatia and of course the sun will be going down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be playing in the evening which will give some respite I think. I think we are definitely used to handling those sorts of conditions. It will be important to use the ball well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for certain and we\u2019ve got all the sort of cooling strategies and rehydration strategies that any team would have really.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Southgate added that Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka faces a late fitness test after picking up a knock in training on Friday.",

          "text": "Countries across Europe are scrambling to accelerate coronavirus vaccinations and outpace the spread of the more infectious delta variant, in a high-stakes race to prevent hospital wards from filling up again with patients fighting for their lives.\n\nThe urgency coincides with Europe\u2019s summer holiday months, with fair weather bringing more social gatherings and governments reluctant to clamp down on them. Social distancing is commonly neglected, especially among the young, and some countries are scrapping the requirement to wear masks outdoors.\n\nIncentives for people to get shots include free groceries, travel and entertainment vouchers, and prize drawings. The president of Cyprus even appealed to a sense of patriotism.\n\nThe risk of infection from the delta variant is \u201chigh to very high\u201d for partially or unvaccinated communities, according to the European Centre for Disease Control, which monitors 30 countries on the continent. It estimates that by the end of August, the variant will account for 90% of cases in the European Union.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to progress with the vaccine rollout at a very high pace,\u201d the ECDC warned.\n\nThe World Health Organization is also concerned. The variant makes transmission growth \u201cexponential,\u201d according to Maria Van Kerkhove, its technical lead on COVID-19.\n\nDaily new case numbers are already climbing sharply in countries like the United Kingdom, Portugal and Russia.\n\nIn the U.K., cases of the delta variant have increased fourfold in less than a month, with confirmed cases Friday up 46% on the previous week.\n\nPortuguese health authorities this week reported a \u201cvertiginous\u201d rise in the prevalence of the delta variant, which accounted for only 4% of cases in May but almost 56% in June. The country is reporting its highest number of daily cases since February, and the number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals has surpassed 500 for the first time since early April.\n\nReports of new infections in Russia more than doubled in June, topping 20,000 per day this week, and deaths hit 679 on Friday, the fourth day in a row that the death toll set a daily record.\n\nStill, \u201cno one wants any lockdowns,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov at a briefing, although he admitted that the virus situation in a number of Russian regions is \u201ctense.\u201d\n\nIn some countries, the virus is spreading much faster among younger people. In Spain, the national 14-day case notification rate per 100,000 people rose to 152 on Friday. But for the 20-29 age group, it shot up to 449.\n\nThose numbers have triggered alarm across the continent.\n\nThe Dutch government is extending its vaccination program to those aged 12-17 to help head off a feared new surge. Greece is offering young adults 150 euros ($177) in credit after their first jab. Rome authorities are mulling the use of vans to vaccinate people at the beach. And Poland last week launched a lottery open only to adults who are fully vaccinated, with new cars among the prizes.\n\nPortuguese authorities have extended the hours of vaccination centers, created new walk-in clinics, called up armed forces personnel to help run operations, and reduced the period between taking the two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from 12 weeks to eight weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against the clock,\u201d Cabinet Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said.\n\nIn the fight against vaccine hesitancy across Europe, the appearance of variants has fed public uncertainty about how effective the shots are.\n\nIn Madrid this week, Claudia Aguilar, a 58-year-old archaeologist, got her second Pfizer-BioNTech jab at an auditorium that is expanding its working hours overnight.\n\nNevertheless, she said she is \u201cnot sure I\u2019ll really be immune\u201d against future variants.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m a bit skeptical that this is going to do any good,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nBartender Yevgeniya Chernyshkova was lined up Thursday for a shot at Moscow\u2019s GUM department store just off Red Square after the government required vaccinations for workers in some sectors.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s becoming mandatory and we all understand why \u2014 because the third wave of the pandemic has started here,\u201d she said.\n\nFifteen months after WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, some governments appear more minded to reward public patience while thinking twice about bringing back restrictions.\n\nSome 40,000 fans went to England\u2019s European Championship soccer match against Germany at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium last week. In Portugal, new restrictions have been half-hearted, such as limiting restaurant opening hours on weekend nights.\n\nIn Moscow, however, restaurants, bars and cafes on Monday began admitting only customers who have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months or can provide a negative test in the previous 72 hours.\n\nFrance lifted the last of its major restrictions Wednesday, allowing unlimited crowds in restaurants, at weddings and most cultural events despite fast-rising cases of the delta variant.\n\nTiago Correia, an associate professor at Lisbon\u2019s Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, detects a mood of public impatience, especially among young people keen to enjoy warm summer nights.\n\n\u201cPeople want to return to normal more quickly than the vaccination rollout is happening,\u201d he said.\n\nThe emerging variants have shone a light on the unprecedented scale of the immunization programs. The ECDC says that in the countries it surveys, 61% of people over 18 have had one shot and 40% are completely vaccinated.\n\nBut Dr. Hans Kluge, the head of the WHO\u2019s Europe office, cautioned this week that the delta variant is poised to become dominant by August in the 53-country region his office covers. And he notes that some 63% of people in that region haven\u2019t had a first jab.\n\n\u201cThe three conditions for a new wave of excess hospitalizations and deaths before the (fall) are therefore in place: New variants, deficit in vaccine uptake, increased social mixing,\u201d Kluge said.",

          "text": "Seventeen governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states will on Monday converge on Lagos for the second time this year to continue their search for solution to the myriad of problems confronting the country.\n\nAt the last meeting, hosted by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and attended by 15 of the 17 southern governors, they arrived at a 12-point resolution, which included the banning of open grazing in all the states.\n\nSources said the meeting on Monday in Lagos would examine the progress made regarding the Asaba Declaration, examine oppositions to some of the demands and come up with a better strategy for actualising the demands.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe governors are working towards a better Southern Nigeria within the Nigerian nation. This meeting is in continuation of that agenda. It is a continuation of the meeting held in Asaba. The southern governors will be looking at the gains of the last meeting and come up with their next move.\n\n\u201cYou know the southern governors agreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken towards the restructuring of the Nigerian federation leading to the devolution of power. They want inclusive government at the federal level, state police, a review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments, and creation of some other institutions, which will legitimately advance commitment to the practice of true federalism. Strategies are needed to actualise all these. This is why they are meeting again in Lagos.\u201d\n\nAnother source close to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is chief host, said in the spirit of Lagos hospitality, the Lagos governor has promised to provide a conducive environment for the 17 governors to brainstorm properly.\n\nDuring the first meeting in Asaba, the southern governors resolved to ban all forms of open grazing in the southern states of the country.\n\nAlthough, the governors came short of calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to reshuffle heads of top agencies to reflect federal character against the backdrop of the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nature of Nigeria, they urged the President to ensure that the sensibilities of the people were respected and reflected in federal appointments.\n\nWhile affirming the commitment of the peoples of Southern Nigeria to \u201cthe unity of the country on the basis of fairness, equity and oneness,\u201d the governors expressed grave concern about the security challenge plaguing the country and charged the President to act decisively to address the situation.\n\nSpecifically, the governors of the southern states called on President Buhari to convoke a national conference to address the insecurity and other challenges in order to restore the confidence of the citizens in the Nigerian geo-political entity.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said that the southern governors \u201cobserved that incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security.\u201d\n\nBut the federal government responded, saying the southern governors\u2019 proposed plan to enforce the ban on open grazing \u201cis of questionable legality.\u201d\n\nSegun James",

          "text": "Four million doses of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine from the US are heading to Indonesia, the US national security adviser has informed the Indonesian foreign minister, as the country battles record coronavirus infections and deaths that forced an emergency lockdown starting on Saturday.\n\nIn a call with Retno Marsudi on Friday, Jake Sullivan said the doses would be shipped via the COVAX global vaccine sharing programme \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d a White House statement said.\n\nSullivan said the donation \u201cunderscored the United States\u2019 support for the people of Indonesia as they fight a surge in COVID-19 cases\u201d.\n\nThe two officials also discussed US plans to increase assistance for Indonesia\u2019s broader COVID-19 response efforts, the statement said.\n\n\u201cSullivan highlighted the importance the Biden-Harris administration places on Indonesia, Southeast Asia and ending the pandemic more broadly and pledged continued support and high-level engagement,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s fourth-most populous country and has been battling one of Asia\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nThe nation has recorded record new infections on eight of the past 12 days, including 25,830 new cases on Friday, and a record 539 deaths.\n\nIn Jakarta province alone, Governor Anies Baswedan said in a press conference on Friday that active cases have already reached 78,000 from 27,000 in February.\n\nAnies said that if the trend continues, the active cases could hit 100,000 in a few days.\n\nSince the pandemic last year, Indonesia has reported a total of 2,228,938 cases and 59,534 deaths.\n\nThe surge in new cases and deaths has prompted President Joko Widodo to declare emergency restrictions on movement starting on Saturday in the island of Java and Bali. The lockdown is effective until July 20.\n\nPenny K Lukito, the chief of Indonesia\u2019s food and drug agency, said earlier on Friday it authorised the Moderna vaccine for emergency use.\n\nMeanwhile, the country\u2019s health minister also announced on Friday that Indonesia is planning to vaccinate under-18s with the coronavirus mRNA shot jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.\n\nBudi Gunadi Sadikin said the island of Java, home to about half of the country\u2019s more than 270 million people, was where most outbreaks with the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19 occurred. The variant was first identified in India.\n\n\u201cShe was healthy, her pregnancy was normal, and suddenly she\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is seen as 84 percent effective, even with the Delta variant, after two doses, but only 34 percent effective with only one dose, according to a report by the US website NBC Boston.\n\nModerna also announced on Tuesday that its vaccine showed promise against the Delta variant, based on a study conducted on blood serum from eight participants obtained one week after they received the second dose of the vaccine.\n\nThe company said the vaccine was far more effective in producing antibodies against the Delta variant than it was against the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.\n\nIndonesia has relied mainly on the vaccine from China\u2019s Sinovac, but has been looking to diversify supply sources.\n\nWashington has been competing with Beijing to deepen geopolitical clout through so-called vaccine diplomacy, although it has said it is not sharing vaccines to secure favours or extract concessions, but to save lives and end the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden administration pledged last month to share an initial 80 million US-made vaccines globally amid concern about the disparity in vaccination rates between advanced and developing countries.\n\nIt has already announced plans to provide vaccines to other Southeast Asian countries \u2013 the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, and Cambodia.\n\nIt has also said it will buy 500 million Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to distribute to the African Union and 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries.",
