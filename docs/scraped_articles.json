          "text": "The UEFA Champions League is back and by the end of Matchday 3 every team will have faced the three opponents in their section once.\n\nFixtures\n\nTuesday 19 October\n\nGroup A: Club Brugge vs Manchester City (18:45 CET), Paris vs Leipzig\n\nGroup B: Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid vs Liverpool, Porto vs AC Milan\n\nGroup C: Be\u015fikta\u015f vs Sporting CP (18:45 CET), Ajax vs Dortmund\n\nGroup D: Shakhtar Donetsk vs Real Madrid, Inter vs Sheriff\n\nWednesday 20 October\n\nGroup E: Barcelona vs Dynamo Kyiv (18:45 CET), Benfica vs Bayern\n\nGroup F: Young Boys vs Villarreal, Manchester United vs Atalanta\n\nGroup G: Salzburg vs Wolfsburg (18:45 CET), LOSC vs Sevilla\n\nGroup H: Chelsea vs Malm\u00f6, Zenit vs Juventus\n\nSu\u00e1rez faces familiar opponents\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez scored 82 goals in 133 games for Liverpool and the in-form striker will be the centre of attention when his former club head to Atl\u00e9tico. The 34-year-old and his opponents both have scores to settle too \u2013 Su\u00e1rez\u2019s last meeting with the English club saw his Barcelona side overwhelmed 4-0 in the 2018/19 semi-final second leg while the Reds\u2019 defence of the trophy the following season was ended by Atl\u00e9tico.\n\nHat-trick hopefuls Shakhtar\n\nShakhtar Donetsk go head to head with Real Madrid once again, looking to make it three consecutive group stage victories against them after winning 3-2 in the Spanish capital and 2-0 in Kyiv last season. Scooping three points is the most pressing thing for the Ukrainian side, though, given they only have one to date, but it will be far from straightforward with the Merengues eager to respond to their shock home defeat by Sheriff on Matchday 2.\n\nDouble century incoming\n\nIt is a rare occurrence to witness a player making his 100th appearance in UEFA club competition but two in one game? That\u2019s like gold dust but could be the case in St Petersburg on Wednesday if both Zenit defender Yaroslav Rakits\u2019kyy and Juventus stalwart Leonardo Bonucci are involved. The pair have started on both matchdays to date and been pivotal \u2013 the Bianconeri are yet to concede while the Russian side have only been breached once.\n\nM\u00fcller to check Benfica again?\n\nBenfica raised eyebrows on Matchday 2 when they cruised past Barcelona 3-0 but victory against Bayern on Wednesday would arguably eclipse that achievement. However, the weight of history is heavy on their shoulders \u2013 the Eagles have not beaten the German giants in any of their ten meetings in UEFA club competition. The closest they came was in the 2015/16 quarter-final second leg where Thomas M\u00fcller helped his side draw 2-2 and progress. Ominously for Jorge Jesus\u2019 men, M\u00fcller needs one goal to become the eighth man to reach 50 in the Champions League.",

Gen Faruk Yahaya on Monday commenced an operational visit of the 8 division area of responsibility with a charge to troops to redouble their efforts in routing the bandits from their camps and enclaves.\n\nThe COAS gave the charge just as the Governor of Sokoto State, Right Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stressed that the recent attacks on Goronyon village was quite disheartening and therefore informed the need to review strategies of military operations in the zone to prevent a reccurrence.\n\nOn his part, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar urged the COAS to mobilize every available resources at his disposal to confront the adversaries of the state.\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the governor, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya assured, that the NA will not disappoint the government and people, as effort is ongoing to reorganise and rejig the operations in the Northwest.\n\nHe emphasized that the NA is working assiduously with other security agencies and stakeholders to robustly confront the situation.\n\nHe commended Governor Tambuwal for his continuous support to the NA and urged him not to relent on his effort.\n\nAt the Headquarters 8 Division, the COAS received a brief on the security situation of Sokoto and the contiguous states from the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Uwem Bassey.\n\nHe commended the officers and soldiers of the Division for their commitment and urged them to redouble their efforts in the fight against banditry.\n\nHe advised the commanders to always appreciate the contributions of other stakeholders for supporting the NA in the ongoing joint operations.\n\nHe assured the troops of his readiness to provide the necessary equipment to conduct their operations.\n\nOn troops\u2019 welfare, the COAS assured the personnel of constructing additional accommodation blocks for personnel, adding that uniform and military kits will also be provided.\n\nIn continuation of the fulfilment of his pledge to empower Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) of the NA, the COAS presented a Toyota 4\u00d74 Hilux vehicle to the RSM of the Division, Master Warrant Officer Simon Jimba.\n\nGeneral Yahaya reiterated that RSMs are the bedrock of NA regimentation and as such adequate attention needed to be accorded them, so they could effectively\n\ngroom the young soldiers.\n\nThe COAS also visited the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Dr Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, the III.\n\nDuring his remarks at the Sultan\u2019s palace, General Yahaya stated he was in the Palace to pay his respect and to seek the Sultan\u2019s guidance and support, as custodian of the culture and traditions of the people.\n\nHe pointed out, that the role of traditional leaders in the fight against insecurity is key in every society.\n\nHe added that traditional leaders must therefore find ways of discouraging youths from partaking in criminality in society.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal had earlier reaffirmed his commitment to support the Nigerian Army (NA) to tackle insecurity bedevilling the Northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that in spite of the state\u2019s lean resources, the state government will do all it could to provide requisite support to end banditry in Sokoto and the contiguous states.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal, who noted that the visit was a homecoming for the COAS as a worthy son of Sokoto state, urged him to review the ongoing operations with renewed strategies to identify and destroy bandits\u2019 enclaves.\n\nHe further called for collective effort among citizens and security agencies to fish out perpetrators of heinous crimes in society.\n\nHe cautioned the public not to shield anyone supporting banditry, especially their informants and logistics suppliers.\n\nHe also called on the Federal Government to inject more personnel and resources to make operations much easier for the security agencies.\n\nHis Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar assured the COAS of his continuous support to enable him to succeed in his mandate.\n\nThe COAS later visited frontline troops deployed at forwarding Operation Base Sabon Birnin and Isa, both in Sokoto state, to assess the security situation, following recent bandits\u2019 attack on the communities.\n\nWhile addressing troops at the respective FOBs, the COAS commended them for restoring peace in the communities even as he urged them to remain alert and vigilant to prevent any surprise attack.",

But now there is nothing to wait for.\u201d\n\nSylva also stated that he was expecting a lot of growth and development of the industry, saying the industry had been stagnated for a long time because the process of passing the PIA had been very arduous, having taken over 20 years.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Nigeria glad US is back on climate change agenda\u2014Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says Nigeria was delighted that the US was fully back on the global climate change agenda.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesman, Laolu Akande, said in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja that the vice president said this when he received, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, a US government delegation led by the White House Deputy National Security Advisor, Mr Jonathan Finer.\n\nThe vice president said the move was a commendable restoration of the US government\u2019s support for the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the US is fully on board with climate change and back to the table on this issue. I think one has to commend the drive that this US administration has put behind climate change\u201d, Osinbajo said.\n\nFour years ago, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration had announced US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBut, on assumption to power earlier this year, President Joe Biden\u2019s administration announced the restoration of US\u2019s commitments to the Paris Agreement.\n\nOsinbajo reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s position regarding a just transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, ahead of the Net-zero Emissions 2050 target, saying that Nigeria\u2019s Energy Transition Plan was the first in Africa.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWe are concerned, amongst other things, first about some of what has been going on, especially around gas as an effective transition fuel, and how many of the Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and some countries are insisting that gas projects should be defunded.\n\n\u201cThis is a principal concern to us; it is one that we have made central to our advocacy and it is one of the issues that we intend to promote at the COP26.\n\n\u201cWe have done the costing for it and all of what is required to be able to hit net-zero by 2050.\n\n\u201c Also, what the implications would be, given the constraints there, and how realistic it would be to get to net-zero by 2050 or not.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the Democracy Summit which President Biden would be hosting later in the year, Osinbajo said that Nigeria looked forward to participating at the summit.\n\nThe vice president harped on the need to discourage illicit financial flows, adding that \u201dthe international monetary and financial systems have a role in stopping it.\n\nREAD ALSO: Lagos to join climate change group\n\n\u201cLooking at what happened in the last few years, we have received quite a bit of support from the US government, especially in terms of the repatriation of several of the looted funds, and we hope to continue to get the cooperation of the US.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke on the nation\u2019s security concerns in relation to the activities of ISWAP and ISIS.\n\nOsinbajo recognised the role of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (D-ISIS) as a very important initiative in sending the right signals, especially in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what is going on today in certain regions like the Lake Chad and the Sahel, it is very apparent that we need that kind of resolve in order to be able to deal with ISWAP and Boko Haram in Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe vice president expressed the Federal Government\u2019s gratitude to the US government for donating over 3.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Nigeria.\n\nEarlier, Finer had informed Osinbajo of a potential partnership with Nigeria on a G-7 Infrastructure Programme, \u2018Build Back Better World\u2019, which the US President had made a priority.\n\n\u201cIt involves bringing together a range of funding sources, development finance and the private sector, to work with key partner-countries to develop their infrastructure and fill the gap between infrastructure needs and the current state of infrastructure.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe American Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Advisor, Maj.- Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd) and other US and Nigerian senior government officials also attended the meeting.\n\n(NAN)",

If they test positive, it will affect their progress in school. The test will help us know those that need help early enough before it gets worse.\n\n\u201cIt is the same line of thinking, that in Nigeria, like anywhere else in the world, once a youth, after completing school and getting a job, the next thing is marriage.\n\n\u201cSince in Nigeria we go for genotype test, we do HIV test before marriage, voluntarily, why can\u2019t we add drug test in the list, so that it will further propel reduction in the prevalence?\n\n\u201cAnybody that is positive will cut back because his or her intended wife, husband or in-laws may not be comfortable.\n\n\u201cWe believe from cutting back, he or she will stop the habit or the prospective in- laws will rally round to help,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marwa disclosed that the NDLEA has seized not less than two million kilogrammes of cocaine, heroin, other hard drugs and substances in the past nine months.\n\nHe made the disclosure in New York while addressing the Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Committee of the UN General Assembly, adding that there is no longer \u201chiding place for drug traffickers\u201d in Nigeria.\n\nMarwa said Nigeria had achieved a lot in the war against drug abuse as NDLEA had moved towards the seizure of assets of persons involved and prosecuting them within the limit of human rights.\n\nHe said every kilogramme seized was one kilogramme less on the streets, pointing out that drug abuse in Nigeria had been one of the most worrisome problems in recent times.\n\nHe said drug abuse is the key factor that propels crime in Nigeria, adding that the administration of President Muhammad Buhari is tackling the problem.\n\nHe said the NDLEA had been partnering relevant agencies in its fight against drug abuse, urging parents to rise up to the challenge of sensitising their children against the danger of drug abuse.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

As at this morning, all the 12 were here and they have been deployed to the North East.\n\n\u201cWe can see that the Tucano jets are actually a game changer. Most of the successes we have recorded in recent time is because of the acquisition of the new platforms, not limited to the super Tucano.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the military\u2019s onslaught against terrorists is encouraging people to return to the farms, particularly in the north-east.\n\nCAN, Kalu, Ugwuanyi, Okowa, others greet Muslims\n\nThe leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Uzor Oji Kalu, governors and others have felicitated with the leadership of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) and all Muslims in the country on the occasion of Moulid an-Nabi, birthday of Prophet Mohammed.\n\nCAN General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, in a statement urged government at all levels to double their efforts in stopping the menace of terrorism and all banditry activities in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe rejoice and pray that God will continue to keep us one in His love, benevolence and mercy.

We must sustain peace and unity in our communities, states and at the national level. Let use use this festive season to show love, affection, piety and service to humanity.\u201d\n\nKalu wished the muslim community a hitch-free Eid -el maulud celebration.\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi calls for renewed faith in God, prayers\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has called on all Nigerians to renew their faith in God and intensify prayers for the country to surmount its challenges.\n\nIn his goodwill message, hei urged Muslims and indeed all Nigerians to remain committed to the core values of the nation\u2019s founding fathers so that the concerted efforts at sustaining the peace, unity and progress of the country will be fully actualized.\n\nThe governor pointed out that the significance of Eid-ul-Mawlid anchored on love, sacrifice, obedience, tolerance and charity, as exemplified by the deeds and teachings of Holy Prophet Muhammad, is germane to the peaceful co-existence, unity and prosperity of Nigeria.\n\n\u2022Wike, Okowa call for tolerance, prayers\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike called on the Muslim community to use the celebration to advance the cause of religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence.\n\nIn a statement by Kelvin Ebiri, the governor said that his administration will continue to promote religious tolerance among all residents of the state.\n\nGovernor Wike advised the Muslim faithfuls to imbibe the virtues of love, peace, patience, communal living and honesty which were qualities of Prophet Mohammed, in their daily lives.\n\nThe governor, while wishing the Muslim community a wonderful Eid-ul-Mawlid celebration, urged them to always pray for the government and people of the state.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State called on Nigerians to intensify prayers to end violent crimes in the country.\n\nHe urged Muslims to follow the exemplary leadership of Holy Prophet Muhammad by promoting peaceful co-existence and offering prayers for the peace, unity and continuous progress of Nigeria.\n\nHe said Nigeria was currently plagued by insurgency and other violent crimes, including banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery, herders/farmers clashes and agitations which had continued to impede growth and development of the country.\n\nHe said funds that the federal and states governments would have used for development were being wasted in combating the crimes and protecting lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nOkowa charged Nigerians to shun all divisive tendencies and work towards building a better nation, saying the celebration of the birth of the Prophet should renew the faith and bond of unity among the people irrespective of the diversities.\n\nHe specifically urged the Muslims and other religious groups to intensify prayers for needed reforms for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u2022Ekweremadu: Be brother\u2019s keeper\n\nFormer deputy senate president, Ike Ekweremadu (PDP-Enugu), urged Nigerians to close ranks and be their brother\u2019s keeper to move the nation forward.\n\n\u201cEid-El-Maulud calls for deep reflections on the values of peaceful co-existence, unity, and love for one\u2019s neighbour.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, call on Nigerians to be their brother\u2019s keeper and to join hands so that we can charge together, confronting the many challenges facing us as a nation.

If we can get it right at the smallest unit of society which is the family, it will be easier to fix the ills that have become prevalent in the larger society.\n\n\u201cBeyond celebrating with immediate family, we should also extend a hand of fellowship to others around us, regardless of affiliations, creed, and religion.\u201d\n\nIn his own reaction, former Anambra State governor, Mr. Peter Obi, urged Muslims to continue to seek the peace and progress of the nation.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Obaigbena salutes a man who chaired event that birthed ARISE Group\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, have extended the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the United States President, Joe Biden, and the people of America over the demise of a former US Secretary of State, General Colin Powell.\n\nThey expressed their feelings over the demise of Powell in separate statements yesterday.\n\nAlso paying tribute to the late former Secretary of State, the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, saluted Powell for his support and inspiration that ultimately helped to birth ARISE News Channel. According to him, \u201cPowell enabled the emergence of Arise News Channel, Africa\u2019s leading global broadcaster, through his support for the Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, which he Chaired at the Royal Albert Hall, London in 2008. Arise Magazine, the global style and culture platform later transformed into the Arise News Channel in 2013 and is now available to over 200 million people around the world on multiple platforms.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, said he believed that as the first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the US Department of Defense as well as the first African-American Secretary of State, Powell was a great statesman and a global icon in every sense of it.\n\nHe recounted that as US Secretary of State, Powell played a very important role in advancing his country\u2019s foreign policy and national defence interests as well as being a great advocate of the eradication of Polio and addressing the deadly spread of HIV/AIDS disease in Africa.\n\nBuhari said his prayers and thoughts were with Powell\u2019s family and the people of the United States as they mourned the death of an exceptional leader and one of America\u2019s greatest prides, who as a professional soldier, a distinguished public servant and an effective diplomat, gave his utmost for his country.\n\nObasanjo, in his message, described the death of Powell as a loss not only to the America, but to the entire world, stressing that the late Powell was a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-arm, whose closeness as an African-American with the mother Africa assisted in the growth of the continent.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said, \u201cGeneral Powell\u2019s tenure in office marked a significant departure from the traditional relations between Africa and the United States.\n\n\u201cHe was Secretary of State under the administration of President George W. Bush, Jnr, part of the time I was President of Nigeria. He was not just an African-American, he was an African-American, who understood Africa. That is what I found in him, when he was Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cWith him, among others, I have always seen advantage in the closeness of the African-Americans with the mother Africa. It is mutually good and beneficial for the Africans at home and for our brothers and sisters in diaspora in the US, Caribbean or Southern America.\n\n\u201cI cherished our relationship for the good of humanity in general and especially, for the good of our race, which collectively is the most abused, despised and disregarded race in modern history. He was indeed a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-Arm,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former president noted that the news of Powell\u2019s death was received with sadness, adding, \u201chis death is a great loss not only to his immediate family and to the United States of America but also to the entire world.\n\n\u201cThough the world, particularly Africa, would miss him, his legacies would continue to inspire many to reach the highest points of their productive, political and creative abilities. May God grant his soul perfect peace and rest.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Jonathan in a tribute personally signed, described late Powell as a renowned United States public servant and great leader, who left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time.\n\nHe also stated that his stellar military career paved the way for other African Americans to reach for the top, because he articulated a new paradigm for engaging in military action.\n\nThe former President, in a statement by his Special Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, stated: \u201cUntil the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, Colin Powel was the highest ranking African-American to have served in the public sector of the United States. In that capacity, he served as a beacon of hope and was a pride of the Black Race.\n\n\u201cHis stellar military career, which saw him become the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which pivoted him to also becoming the first US Secretary of State of colour, paved the way for other African-Americans to reach for the top. His articulation of the Powell Doctrine gave the United States, and the world at large, a new paradigm for engaging in military action with honour and decorum.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of State, he was known for his tactful management of America\u2019s foreign relations, of which he extended a right hand of fellowship to the Yar\u2019Adua administration, when I was Vice President.\n\n\u201cHis death, at 84 after a long, useful and fulfilled life, is mourned by my family and I, as well as the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation. He left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time, and would be greatly missed. Our prayers are with his family at this trying time for them.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Minister of External Affairs, Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, said his admiration for the late Powell was usually for his astute military insights and less for his political performance.\n\nThe former Director General of the Nigeria Institute International Affairs (NIIA) explained that, \u201cFor instance, while evicting Sadam Hussain\u2019s military from Kuwait, he declared it would be a strategic mistake to overthrow Sadam himself. That view has been vindicated. That he got roped into the weapons of mass destruction deception is the stuff of politics, which perhaps explains his disdain of it.\n\n\u201cThe second reason for my admiration is what is now referred to as the Colin Powell doctrine about the need of \u2018overwhelming force\u2019 to guarantee military victory. In this respect, I recall a debate about the appropriate size of the Nigerian army in the aftermath of the Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cLeading the side for downsizing were military Hawks like Gen TY Danjuma (and some of his colleagues in the Ruling Council) who saw a \u2018small compact and mobile Force\u2019 as being more economical for national defence arrangement,\u201d Akinyemi explained.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that then, in opposition was a group whose prominent advocate was himself, saying he preferred a large military for purposes of National defence.\n\nAkinyemi said he had argued then that there could be circumstances when only overwhelming force could win a war (a sort of Colin Powell doctrine).\n\n\u201cSuch circumstances as when a nation is besieged by guerilla warfare that overstretches the military. The military proponents decided to prune the military from about a quarter of a million men to about 100 thousand.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Powell\u2019s support for the Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, two major ideas that changed the course of Africa\u2019s entertainment and social space would later transform into the Arise Television Group, Nigeria\u2019s foremost international television station, acclaimed to be shattering ceilings.\n\nPowell, during one of the festivals that usually featured musical concerts of both local and international acts, had performed a popular \u201cYahooze dance\u201d with the crooner, Olu Maintain, to the awe of the world.\n\nBoth Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, ultimately gave rise to the fast rising television station of global standard, Arise News Channel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says their days are numbered\n\n\u2022Troops kill 10 in Kaduna\n\n\u2022Tambuwal calls for coordinated operations in state\n\n\u2022Ortom worries about situation in schools\n\n\u2022US expresses readiness to help\n\nDeji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode in Abuja, George Okoh In Makurdi, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in parts of the country, saying their days are numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 40 people by bandits at Goronyo market, in Sokoto State, sent a tough warning to the criminals and declared, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari had earlier taken a critical look at the security situation in the country before news of the massacre in Sokoto State filtered in. He had boasted that the military and other security agencies were recording greater successes in the bid to rid the country of insecurity.\n\nThe president, however, counselled the Nigerian media on the need for accurate reportage of security and safety issues by replacing the usage of phrases, like \u201crising insecurity\u201d, with \u201cdeclining insecurity\u201d.\n\nBut in Kaduna State, security forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area.\n\nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, reacting to the killing in his state, called on the Nigeria Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to help stamp out banditry in the region.\n\nIn a similar vein, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concerns about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in schools across the country.\n\nUnited States reiterated its readiness to lend support to Nigeria in its bid to contain insecurity.\n\nBuhari, in a release by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, declared, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before.\u201d\n\nBuhari added, \u201cThe bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to Nigerians not to despair, because his administration was determined, more than ever before, to protect Nigerians from murderous criminal gangs with no respect for the sanctity of human of life. He extended his sympathy to the families of the victims of the Goronyo attack and called on the people to remain patient, as the military strategised on how to crush the bandits.\n\nIn yet another presidential message by Shehu, to felicitate with the Muslim Ummah, Nigerians of all faiths and the followers of Islam all over the world on the occasion of Maulud-Un-Nabiyy, Buhari gave a snapshot of the increased activities of the armed forces, the police, and intelligence agencies to effectively respond to the security challenges in the country. He said the increased cooperation from the citizenry, coupled with reinvigorated, dynamic, and energised police, security and military leadership was helping the administration score more victories against terror, criminality, and economic sabotage.\n\nHe argued that the reality of declining insecurity should replace the inaccurate narrative of rising insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform, who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more,\u201d Buhari said. \u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the government expected and intended for those trends to continue, and called on the media to address the tone, content, and standards of reporting on security and safety measures.\n\nHe said the time had come for the media to revise the prefixes \u201crising insecurity\u201d with \u201cdeclining insecurity.\u201d\n\nIn his felicitation with the Muslim Ummah to mark the Eid-Ul-Maulud on Tuesday, which has been declared a public holiday throughout the federation, Buhari said, \u201cI am delighted to send greetings of peace, unity and goodwill to the Muslim Ummah, fellow citizens, and Muslims all over the world as they observe and celebrate Eid-ul- Maulud.\u201d\n\nHe urged Muslims to strive for \u201cforgiveness and closeness to the noble life and teachings of the Prophet (SAW), whose birthday is being marked on this blessed day. On this auspicious occasion, I wish you all the blessings of today.\u201d\n\nSecurity Forces Kill 10 Bandits in Kaduna\n\nSecurity forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, one person was killed while three others were abducted by bandits in Oil Village, a community located near Kaduna Refinery in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The bandits were said to have invaded Oil Village on Saturday night, unleashing terror on the residents.\n\nSources in the community said one Mr. Auta was killed by the bandits while attempting to alert the community about the presence of the criminals.\n\nOne source said, \u201cMr. Auta noticed the presence of the bandits and he sneaked out of his house to alert the community since telephone services had been cut off.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as he was manoeuvring his way out to alert the community, the bandits sighted him and shot him dead. The bandits were many and were well armed, we couldn\u2019t alert security agencies, because telecom services had been cut off in our area.\u201d\n\nHe added that three other people, including a medical doctor and his son, where abducted. The doctor was said to have withdrawn his son from one of the schools for fear of kidnappers, only to be abducted at home.\n\nAnother resident of the area, who shared the information on a WhatsApp platform of \u201cCommunity News Update\u201d, said the bandits invaded the community about 11pm on Saturday, killing one of his neighbours while another neighbour and his son were abducted. Lamenting the situation, he solicited for prayers from members of the platform.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, disclosed that 10 bandits were killed by security forces in Kwanan Bataru, on the outskirts of Fatika in Giwa Local Government Area. In a statement on Monday, Aruwan said the bandits were neutralised in a gun duel with security forces, adding that several others escaped with gun shot injuries.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cOne Alhaji Abubakar Usman, who is likely to have been kidnapped in a neighbouring state and was being held by bandits in the area, was rescued by the troops, and is being debriefed at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits, who managed to escape, left behind several motorcycles, one revolver, mobile phones, torchlights and some charms. One of the sheds used by the bandits to hold hostages was burnt.\u201d\n\nBandits Attack Sokoto Sunday Market, Kill 40\n\nNo fewer than 40 people were killed as suspected bandits attacked a market in Goronyo Local Government Area of Sokoto State. The armed men attacked the market on Sunday, which happened to be the market day.\n\nSources in the village said the marauders attacked the market in large numbers and started shooting sporadically, leading to the death of over 40 persons.\n\nA source, which spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the casualty figure was over 40, as the area was still unsafe for residents to access. The attack was the third in the area in two weeks.\n\nLast Thursday, suspected members of the outlawed volunteer vigilante group, also known as Yan Sakai, attacked and killed nine Fulanis at Manmade market in Gwadabawa Local Government Area of the state. Suspected bandits also killed 20 persons at Ungwan Lalle market, in Sabon Birni Local government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe Sokoto State government had earlier ordered the closure of markets in the Eastern Senatorial District of the state as a measure to fight the rising insecurity in the state.\n\nTambuwal Calls for Coordinated Operations in Sokoto\n\nSokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal called on the Nigerian Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to stamp out banditry in the region. Tambuwal made the call on Monday, when the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Sokoto, the state capital.\n\nThe governor disclosed that the operations of the army in Zamfara State were having a negative effect on Sokoto State, especially, the Eastern part of the state, hence the need to carry out the operations simultaneously.\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday and today, we have lost many people in Goronyo Local Government Area of the state,\u201d he said, adding that before now, the situation in the state was not as bad. He appealed to the Nigerian Army to review its operations in the state.\n\nThe governor also asked the Chief of Army staff to deploy more troops, resources, and intelligence to the state to end the banditry. He promised that his administration would do everything in its powers to support the security agencies to end insecurity in the state.\n\nEarlier, Yahaya commended Tambuwal for his support to security agencies in the state. The army chief, who was in Sokoto, his home state, on his first visit since his assumption of office as Chief of Army Staff, said he was in the state as part of a familiarisation tour to divisions across the country. The purpose, he said, was to interact with troops and encourage them on their duties as well as hold security meetings with governors and relevant stakeholders.\n\nHe said the perpetrators of criminal activities across the country were also human, and said there was need to work with everyone to track down the criminals among the people.\n\nIn a related development, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, prayed for the continuous success of the security agencies against criminal elements in the country. While receiving Yahaya in his palace, the Sultan said he was always happy to receiving army personnel, having being one of them before ascending the throne. He disclosed that Sultan\u2019s Palace remained home to everyone, not only the army chief, but every Nigerian, irrespective of where they came from or their religious background.\n\nThe Sultan said his council would continue to pray for the army chief and his people, saying the task before them is more than the civil war era\n\nOrtom Worries over Insecurity in Nigerian Schools\n\nBenue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concern about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in the country. Ortom spoke on Monday at his country house, Gbajimba, in Guma Local Government Area, during the virtual handing over and commissioning of a Government Science Secondary School built by some oil companies in the country, including Chevron, Famfa, Prime, and Equinor.\n\nHe said education remained the bedrock of growth and development of any nation, wondering why schools should be the target of criminals.\n\nThe governor lauded the oil companies for investing heavily in the education sector as part of their social responsibility policy. He pledged, on behalf of his government, that everything in its powers would be done to protect the facility and announced immediate perimeter fencing of the school.\n\nThe governor also decried the high number of internally displaced persons in the area and urged the federal government to do everything to ensure that the people returned to their homes.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will not keep quiet and allow some group of people chase my people away from their homes and continue to make them IDPs. Gbajimba has over 500,000 IDPs. I appeal to the federal government to stop these herdsmen and declare them a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThey should stop the killing and destruction of our property. I will not engage any militia group but seek justice of my people.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a mandatory responsibility of every government. I want to appreciate the recent effort made by government in nipping insecurity in the bud, especially, in the state but it should be sustained.\n\n\u201cI also appreciate the effort of security agencies, who are sacrificing their lives to ensure peace in our state. The federal government should do massive recruitment and adequate funding of security agencies so that they can put in their best in securing the lives of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nUS Ready to Support Nigeria to Fight Insecurity\n\nThe United States government declared its readiness to lend support to Nigeria towards the fight against insecurity. The assurance was given during a meeting between a visiting US Deputy Security Adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, where security issues were discussed.\n\nThe US official said his country was willing to support Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after a closed-door meeting, Finer said, \u201cGoing forward, the security issues are very pretty whether it\u2019s terrorism or piracy, the US can support.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned democracy. The president is very much looking forward to convening the summit for democracy in December. The pillar of this summit is going to be issues relating to election, corruption.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not just a partner of the US but also a friend, which is much appreciated. The time that we spent and the conversations we had are very constructive and the partnership over all.\n\n\u201cI will not repeat all of the minister\u2019s briefing but it does speak the enormous agenda that the two countries share. We talked about the pandemic and the delivery of vaccines and the next phase of this which is actually making sure that those vaccines are administered and get into peoples arms, which is something we want to support.\u201d\n\nOn climate change, Finer said the US \u201cwelcomes Nigeria\u2019s commitment to increase its ambition, when it comes to climate change and we hope that it continues. There are no significant issues on our mutual agenda that can be addressed without working together. So, we are committed to continue doing that.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said the discussion was on a broad range of issues. He said, \u201cWe talked about the security situation of the country: banditry, Boko Haram, secessionist groups and other acts and challenges to insecurity, including that of Guinea and how we can cooperate with the US in addressing all the issues.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging the tremendous support from the US in the area of security, the recent delivery of A29 fighters and supporting other areas, we assessed the situation in the Sahel beyond Nigeria, right up to Libya, and how we can work closely together to address the terrorist challenges and the security situation in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn twitter ban, the minister said, \u201cWe talked about the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and how that is progressing,\u201d adding that the issue of COVID-19 also came up at the meeting.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe talked about the COVID-19 context and the US has been very generous. Just very recently, last week, they provided, again, vaccines to Nigeria, five million, and then another vaccine of 3.5 million that were delivered to the Nigerian government. We are grateful to the US government for this generosity.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Govt declares DPR, PEF, PPPRA defunct\n\n\u2022You have no reason to fret, FG assures agencies\u2019 staff\n\n\u2022My immediate concern is to meet OPEC quota, says Komolafe\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday formally inaugurated the leadership of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURP) as well as the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe development signaled the official winding up of three agencies which they succeeded as prescribed by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe now defunct agencies according to the federal government are the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), whose Director, Mr Sarki Auwalu, was dropped by President Muhammadu Buhari after his name was initially sent to the National Assembly; the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA).\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, while speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of the chief executives of the NURP, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe and his counterpart at the NMDPRA, Mr. Farouk Ahmed, in Abuja, described the occasion as historic, saying it marked the beginning of a new era in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe explained that after a rigorous screening process and the issuance of letters of appointment to the new chief executives, both regulatory agencies have now taken off with competent leadership.\n\nWith the new law, Sylva stated that the federal government was expecting a lot of growth in the oil and gas industry, which he said had been stagnated for a long time while a lot of investors stood aloof.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIA has clarified the legal framework around the sector and the agencies and I don\u2019t see anything now stopping investors from coming and we are very lucky to have very competent industry people with proven experience.\n\n\u201cWe believe they can hit the ground running. Nigeria should brace up for exponential growth in the oil and gas industry,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nOn the fate of the preceding agencies, he explained that it remains a matter of law, noting that as the PIA states, all the assets and even the staff of the agencies would now be vested in the commission and on the authority.\n\n\u201cThat means that the DPR will not have anything. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It also repeals the DPR Act, the Petroleum Inspectorate Act and the Petroleum Equalisation Act and the PPPRA Act. The law specifically repeals them and it is clear that those agencies do not exist anymore.\n\n\u201cThe law also provides for the staff and for the jobs in those agencies to be protected. But I am sure that unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t cover the chief executive who was on a political appointment,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the process of assigning and aligning affected staff was ongoing and would be completed in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThat process will be ongoing because we have to rationalise the staff. The authority has staffing coming from the defunct PEF, PPPRA and the DPR and of course the commission staff will come from the DPR. That\u2019s going to be the process that will be ongoing for the next few weeks or so,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nThe new chief executive of the upstream commission, Komolafe, in his comments, assured that the enactment of the PIA would usher in a massive turnaround in the activities of the upstream that he was appointed to midwife.\n\n\u201cNigerians should expect massive deliverables from the moment we take over in the sense that the PIA has ended a regime of uncertainty in terms of the governance of the industry.\n\n\u201cBasically, we shall focus on activities that enhance the production activities in the upstream in a manner that we will be able to hit our OPEC quota and will endeavour to ensure that we deliver to Nigerians a 21st century regulatory commission.\n\n\u201cWe will not just be a regulator, we will be an enabler of investment. So, Nigeria should expect be part of what we actually plan under our watch,\u201d he stressed.\n\nOn plans by the international oil companies (IOCs) to exit their onshore and shallow water operations, Komolafe stated that it remains purely an investment decision, but stressed that the commission would strive to engage the IOCs to understand their challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will engage critically with them and if it becomes their decision to move from their onshore activities, what will be paramount to us is to look at their challenges and see how far we can intervene positively. Don\u2019t forget the act makes the commission both technical and financial regulator.\n\n\u201cWe will do more because investment decisions are commercial decisions and we will see how we can intervene. But it\u2019s an investment decision borne out of certain considerations. We will try to know what those considerations are and intervene where we can.\n\n\u201cBut the key is that we focus on activities that will expand and enhance production activities in a manner that we can be meeting our OPEC quota and as much as possible to optimise the federation revenue,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the midstream and downstream boss, Farouk, promised to give a lot of attention to the development of the country\u2019s enormous gas resources.\n\n\u201cThe key area that you touched which is close to my heart is the gas development. This will lead to industrialisation, job creation and our main focus is to attract investment in gas. Of course, we need to work with the commission, the IOCs to invest in our hydrocarbons and more so in the gas sector because we have abundance of gas even more than the reserve of crude oil.\n\n\u201cWhy do we have shortage of gas, maybe because there\u2019s no investment? Why are we having challenges in investment, maybe because our pricing framework and other parameters that investors look at don\u2019t measure up? The PIB stagnated for over 20 years and the investors were sitting on the fence waiting to see what direction things were going. Now everything is clear, thanks to the government.\n\n\u201cWe will ride on that and create more opportunities for investment by going through the whole value chain for production to consumption in terms of fair pricing to all stakeholders,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum, Dr. Nasir Gwarzo, in his remarks urged all the staff of the defunct agencies not to fret over their future, stating that everyone would be fairly treated.\n\n\u201cThis is to assure our staff and CEOs that the transition process has been fine-tuned in such a way that shows smooth transition including the anxiety among members of staff across board. There\u2019s a strong leadership under the minister of state to make sure everybody is given a fair transition,\u201d he assured.\n\nOn his part, Auwalu remarked that the defunct DPR was willing to ensure a smooth takeover by the new agencies, stating that during week, meetings will be held to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Criminal gangs flush with ransom money, extorting governments\n\n*Farmers sell land to free their children, incidence fuelling inflation\n\n*NAF describes allegation of payments to bandits as \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nUgo Aliogo with agency report\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has described how the Nigerian military paid cash to buy back an anti-aircraft gun that posed a threat to President Muhammadu Buhari, who flew through the endangered airspace to his hometown, some 80 miles away.\n\nThe report alleged that kidnapping gangs that encamped in Nigeria\u2019s Rugu forest had seized the anti-aircraft gun during a clash with a military unit. It stated that the ransom, almost $50,000 in crisp Nigerian bank notes, was paid to retrieve the weapon.\n\nSoldiers, intelligence officers, and mediators, who had visited the kidnapping camps, described a surfeit of munitions, which included more anti-aircraft guns acquired since the mission to buy one back.\n\nBut the Nigerian Air Force, in a statement, described the report that it made such payment to armed bandits as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State (and) other parts of the North-west,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt said despite the allegation, NAF conducted air interdiction in the area recently.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to reports alleging that the NAF, through one of its personnel, paid the sum of N20 million to armed bandits operating in Jibia Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State in exchange for an anti-aircraft gun allegedly seized.\n\n\u201cThe report went on to state that the reason behind the payment was to retrieve the anti-aircraft gun which, it alleged, the NAF feared could be used against aircraft operating within Katsina State.\u201d\n\nNAF said there was no iota of truth in the allegation, adding that it is designed to cast aspersion on the service.\n\nIt alleged, \u201cThe said report is totally false. It should therefore be taken as fake news and disregarded. Indeed, we ordinarily would not have responded to such baseless and utterly illogical allegation but for the need to set the record straight as well as reaffirm the NAF\u2019s unflinching commitment to decisively dealing with the armed bandits and all other criminal elements.\u201d\n\nNAF stated further, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, it must be stated that there is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State, other parts of the North-west as well as other Theatres of Operation in the country.\u201d\n\nHowever, the federal government did not respond to THISDAY\u2019s request for comments.\n\nBut the foreign journal maintained, \u201cCriminal factions appear to be better equipped with larger-capacity advanced weaponry than national security agencies,\u201d quoting a confidential internal report presented to the president in July.\n\nWSJ further alleged that over several months, the militant leader had agreed to part with the truck-mounted 12.7 millimetre anti-aircraft gun in exchange for the ransom.\n\n\u201cHis men had plenty more munitions,\u201d he was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the army\u2019s weapons,\u201d according to an officer, whose account was corroborated by another senior Nigerian official involved in the previously undisclosed mission, the report said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t pay, we kill them,\u201d a militant leader in Zamfara State, Shehu Rekeb, was quoted to have said in a phone interview.\n\nHis men were herdsmen, he said, who had been mistreated by the state and subjected to arbitrary arrests.\n\nOnce armed with machetes, they now have weapons on par with the military and collaborators inside the army, he was quoted to have claimed.\n\nMore so, the report disclosed that in forests in the North-west, the loosely organised criminal gangs that raised funds by kidnapping school children were now flush with arms, cash and operating beyond the reach of an increasingly fragile state.\n\nIn some instances, government officials in Africa\u2019s most populous nation have been paying the gangs to return stolen weapons and kidnapped personnel, WSJ said, citing confidential documents and interviews with senior military officials, soldiers and independent mediators, and one of the gang leaders.\n\nThe New York-based newspaper narrated how during one of the incidents, masked men emerged from the forest on motorbikes, surrounding a young intelligence officer clutching a cash-filled bag.\n\nIt said, \u201cAn hour later, the officer, who declined to be identified, was clasping hands with a leader of a diffuse network of criminals, whose campaign of kidnapping civilians\u2014including hundreds of schoolchildren\u2014has raised millions of dollars to build an arsenal of heavy weaponry they are using to wrest control of swaths of the north, including the president\u2019s home state.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s government\u2014still battling Islamic State militants in the North-east\u2014refers to the lesser-known criminal groups in its North-west as \u201cbandits\u201d, the WSJ report said.\n\nIt said several senior security officials described mass kidnapping for ransom as the country\u2019s primary new security crisis.\n\nThe report said one official, who had reviewed intercepts of bandit leaders\u2019 communications, described how the militants spoke of accumulating weapons to defend themselves from rival gangs and from government-backed vigilantes and to conduct increasingly brazen operations against schools, villages, state officials and each other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re settling scores\u2026government cannot do anything,\u201d one senior government security said.\n\nThe bandits have seized more than 1,000 children from their schools this year. Thousands of schools have closed in a country, where half the population is under 18 and which has become home to the world\u2019s largest population of out-of-class children\n\nFarmers have abandoned their land or sold it to purchase their children\u2019s freedom, sending the price of corn, rice and beans to new highs. Hundreds of villages have been deserted, after fighting that has left a quarter of a million people homeless.\n\n\u201cMy son has been captive in the forest for months,\u201d said Bulus Kwoi, whose firstborn was one of 140 students abducted from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna in July. \u201cPlease, will you give us the money to free them?\u201d he appealed.\n\nMost of the bandits are from the Fulani ethnic group, a traditionally cattle-rearing society, whose herdsmen have been fighting for years with farmers over access to dwindling grazing lands.\n\nThe report also alleged that more recently, some herdsmen had reorganised into kidnapping gangs, seizing everyone from villagers to prominent politicians.\n\nLast month, bandits raided a military training college in Kaduna State, north of the capital, killing two soldiers, grabbing more weaponry and kidnapping a ranking military officer, a major at the country\u2019s national defense academy.\n\nConfident that they hold the upper hand, the bandits have called in to talk radio stations to boast of their weaponry and have invited journalists to photograph their stockpiles, WSJ reported.\n\nThe Nigerian Police last month said they arrested three suspects in the kidnapping of students from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna State.\n\nIn the past three months, bandits have been blamed for abducting political leaders and Catholic priests, and for regular killings of policemen. In July, the air force said a pilot was shot down over the Rugu forest after attempting an airstrike on bandit encampments there.\n\nThe report said bandits were a distant priority for United States policy makers focused on Nigeria\u2019s jihadist threat, though American officials said they had intercepted calls from suspected Islamist militants in the North-east, who were advising bandits in the North-west on kidnapping operations and negotiations.\n\nThe Nigerian military opened a new offensive last month, bombarding forest encampments with airstrikes from US-delivered jet fighters. The government ordered cell phone reception suspended across four states, cutting off tens of millions of residents, as part of a military offensive that some officials claimed was succeeding.\n\nVillagers have paid bandits to not kidnap their children, intensifying a protection racket. Unable to defend communities, the governors of three northern states have told citizens to pick up weapons, fuelling a local business of fashioning muskets from scrap metal.\n\n\u201cHardly a day passes by without a person being killed or kidnapped. No single day,\u201d Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari, had said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to rise up,\u201d he added.\n\nWSJ reported that the mission to buy back the anti-aircraft gun began with a handoff from a high-ranking air force intelligence officer in Abuja: a black zip-up bag he alleged was full of N20 million.\n\nIt was given to the young intelligence officer tapped to exchange it for the anti-aircraft gun the bandits had seized in an area, where Buhari frequently flew to visit his hometown of Daura.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThe officer flew to the town of Jibia on the border with Niger, where a dozen armed men emerged from the forest to meet him. They escorted him on motorbikes into thickening forest for hours, arriving at the home of their leader, a wiry man in his 30s, who collected the sack.\n\n\u201cWhile the bandits began disassembling the antiaircraft gun and attempting to strap it to a wobbling motorbike, their leader aired a series of grievances against the state: Vigilantes had kidnapped his father, young men could no longer earn a livelihood rearing cattle, and airstrikes were killing civilians in his camps. \u201cYou are bombing us from the air,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are killing our children.\u201d\n\nHis fighters were conducting reprisal operations against vigilantes and the army, which had helped them accrue a huge weapons stockpile, he said.\n\nEventually, WSJ said, the bandits strapped the antiaircraft gun across two motorbikes and began to wheel it out of the camp. \u201cThey made it look so simple,\u201d the air force officer said. \u201cThey made it feel casual.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State amid a plot to remove his deputy, Rauf Olaniyan, on Monday presented two vehicles worth millions of naira to the immediate past chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha, and his successor, Dayo Ogungbenro.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, the vehicles, both Toyota Land Cruiser SUVs, were presented as an exit gift and a welcome gift to Mustapha and Ogungbenro at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan.\n\n\u201cOyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Monday presented an exit gift and a welcome gift of two brand new Toyota Land Cruiser Jeeps to the outgone chairman of the Oyo State PDP in the state, Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha, and the newly-elected PDP chairman, Dayo Ogungbenro, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe chairman, Oyo State Advisory Council, Senator Hosea Agboola, who made the presentation at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan, on behalf of the governor, charged the duo to work together for the success of the PDP.\n\n\u201cAgboola described the governor as a kind-hearted man who cares for the party and the masses in the state. He also used the occasion to urge other governors in the country to emulate the uniqueness of Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cHe also called on Mustapha and Ogungbenro to collaborate for the progress of the party, adding that the gesture from the governor is commendable and unprecedented in the history of the state. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Plot To Impeach Oyo Deputy Governor Advances, Governor Makinde To Discuss Move With Oyo Lawmakers In Ghana\n\n\u201cIn their various reactions, the duo of Hon. Ogungbenro and Alhaji Mustapha thanked Governor Makinde for his magnanimity. The duo promised to remain focused and to protect the party from the threat of external forces.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, concerns about the governor\u2019s lavish spending as the source of money used to purchase the vehicles remained questionable.\n\nA civil servant, who asked not to be named, described Makinde\u2019s action as a \u201cmisplacement of priority.\u201d\n\nThe donation comes a few hours after SaharaReporters exclusively reported plot to impeach the state Deputy Governor by the PDP/dominated State House of Assembly.\n\nOlaniyan would soon be impeached by the lawmakers, a source privy to the move had said.\n\nJust last weekend, a petrol station and bakery belonging to the Deputy Governor were vandalised in Ibadan.\n\nThere were suspicions in some quarters that the Chairman of the Motor Park Management System in the state, Lamidi Mukaila, popularly called Auxiliary was behind the vandalism.\n\nThe vandalised petrol station and bakery are managed by the wife of the Deputy Governor, Prof. Amdalat Olaniyan.\n\nBefore then, thugs had, twice on the same day, unleashed terror on aggrieved PDP members who had converged for a parallel congress at Jogor Event Centre, Ibadan.\n\nThough this is not the first time, previous impeachment attempts have been thwarted by the lawmakers who feel Olaniyan has been good to them, a source in the state House of Assembly said.\n\nTo make it work this time around, all members have been scheduled to travel to Ghana, a neighbouring West African country.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the trip was coordinated by Makinde\u2019s closest ally, 48-year old Seye Famojuro, who hails from Osun and lives in Ibadan.\n\nIn Ghana, they will be joined by Makinde who would introduce to them, the need for the impeachment process.\n\nThe chairman of the Oyo State House of Assembly Service Commission, Musah AbdulWasii, who is also the immediate past Deputy Speaker of the State House of Assembly, has been pencilled down as a replacement.\n\nThough he contested and lost the last election on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), he is now in PDP and revers Hosea Agboola, a former Senator popularly called Alleluyah as his leader instead of Monsurat Sunmonu, a former Senator and his former leader in the African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nMusah\u2019s preference of Alleluyah to Sunmonu is not far-fetched as the former is closer to Makinde than the latter.\n\nThough both Makinde and Olaniyan are engineers, sources told SaharaReporters that it has been rough since the beginning of the administration.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to win the 2019 governorship poll, many people had suggested the names of Engr. Raufu Olaniyan to Engr. Seyi Makinde. Olaniyan was then a governorship aspirant on the platform of the ADC. He hails from Igboho, one of the numerous towns in Okeogun, the second-largest geo-political zone in Oyo State, after Ibadan, the state capital. Parts of the reasons why Makinde considered him was because of his experience as a former top civil servant,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was permanent secretary of the Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency (OYSTROMA). Secondly, he is acceptable to the Muslim population beyond Okeogun. And he has a deep pocket, though he doesn\u2019t flaunt it. He is also close to former governor Rashidi Ladoja. All these were what Makinde considered.\n\n\u201cBut Olaniyan\u2019s acceptance was at a great cost. His closeness to the former and incumbent governors of Osun, Rauf Aregbesola and Gboyega Oyetola and Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, all of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was almost ruined. They didn\u2019t \u2018bless\u2019 the move. He accepted it and worked tirelessly to ensure PDP wins. Meanwhile, Makinde promised to, unlike his immediate predecessor, make use of his deputy governor if they won.\n\n\u201cGovernor Makinde initially wanted to fulfil his promise but was soon misled by the likes of Alleluyah and co. Initially, Makinde conceded Olaniyan\u2019s Oorelope local government area to him. Alleluyah and Olaniyan are both from Okeogun and he feels threatened by the emergence of Olaniyan.\n\n\"Soon, the governor started ignoring his deputy. In a clear show of hatred, the governor awarded the renovation of the deputy governor\u2019s lodge and till date, it is still at the plastering stage. It is by the road and everyone can see it. So, the deputy governor makes use of his house. When critical issues are to be decided, he prefers to use his chief of staff, secretary to the state government or any other trusted ally. In fact, the deputy governor has been reduced to nothing.\u201d",

They didn\u2019t \u2018bless\u2019 the move. He accepted it and worked tirelessly to ensure PDP wins. Meanwhile, Makinde promised to, unlike his immediate predecessor, make use of his deputy governor if they won.\n\n\u201cGovernor Makinde initially wanted to fulfil his promise but was soon misled by the likes of Alleluyah and co. Initially, Makinde conceded Olaniyan\u2019s Oorelope local government area to him. Alleluyah and Olaniyan are both from Okeogun and he feels threatened by the emergence of Olaniyan.\n\n\"Soon, the governor started ignoring his deputy. In a clear show of hatred, the governor awarded the renovation of the deputy governor\u2019s lodge and till date, it is still at the plastering stage. It is by the road and everyone can see it. So, the deputy governor makes use of his house. When critical issues are to be decided, he prefers to use his chief of staff, secretary to the state government or any other trusted ally. In fact, the deputy governor has been reduced to nothing.\u201d",

So that means the DPR doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, the law specifically repeals the DPR Act, the Petroleum Inspectorate Act, the Petroleum Equalisation Fund Act and the PPPRA Act. The law specifically repeals them. It is very clear that those agencies do not exist anymore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe minister disclosed that staff rationalisation is ongoing, explaining that NMDPRA staff would come from the defunct PEF, PPPRA and DPR, while NURC staff will come from DPR.\n\nHe added that with the passage of the PIA into law after spending over 20 years in the process, the coast is clear for investors to invest in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s (yesterday) event marks the beginning for the news agencies. Their assignment is simple \u2013 to make sure that the new agencies \u2013 take off immediately,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cI am expecting a lot of growth and development in the oil industry. The oil industry has been stagnated for a long time because the process of passing the PIA was on for over 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo a lot of companies, a lot of investors took a sit-down-and-watch approach. The PIA has clarified the legal framework around the sector and the agencies are in place. I don\u2019t see anything now stopping investors from coming.\n\n\u201cAnd we are very lucky to have very competent industry people with proven experiences. So, we believe that they can hit the ground running and Nigerians should brace up for exponential growth in the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Gbenga Komolafe, CEO of NURC, said the commission would deliver on its mandate as captured in the new petroleum act.\n\n\u201cNigerians should expect massive deliverables in the sense that the PIA has ended the regime of uncertainty in terms of the governance of the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKomolafe also said the commission would ensure that the country hits its OPEC quota in crude oil production, as the NURC would be an enabler of investments.",

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "text": "Created by two Americans four years ago to lower the cost of mobile money in Senegal, Wave is currently valued at nearly $2 billion after a recent $200 million Series A round led by Stripe, Sequoia Heritage, Founders Fund, and Ribbit Capital.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Coura Sene \u2013 the startup\u2019s General Manager for the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) \u2013 to discuss Wave\u2019s journey to becoming the first unicorn startup in the French-speaking Africa region.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: Being a top executive at a ~$2bn company, most would picture you always in suits and with a laptop. How do you have fun?\n\nCoura: Firstly, I rarely wear a suit (laughs). I enjoy casual office wear. Wave is the perfect work culture since it\u2019s quite relaxed. In my spare time, I enjoy going out with my children and reading books. It\u2019s how I unwind after a long day at the office. I also like to travel, go out to restaurants, and shopping malls with my family.\n\nMichael: How did your previous roles prepare you for the top position at Wave?\n\nCoura: In my first 10 years of work experience, I learned lessons I can share with a growing team to avoid certain mistakes. In addition to having studied computer science, I have a generalist background that I can apply to most situations. In the second decade of my career, I worked as a freelancer. That taught me how to fight: fight to win the job, fight to get things done, and fight to get paid. It truly made me fearless and instilled in me the mindset to run a fast-growing company like Wave.\n\nMichael: Congratulations on the recent $200m funding. How were you able to build a unicorn startup in four years?\n\nCoura: We weren\u2019t exactly motivated to become a unicorn. Rather, we stayed obsessed with our mission and serving our users, and focused on building a mobile money service that was easy to use and extremely affordable for millions of people. We never lose sight of our mission to build a modern financial network across Africa. It\u2019s what motivates us.\n\nMichael: Okay. I\u2019d appreciate some context into the early days of Wave. How different are things now compared to then?\n\nCoura: In the early days, we were just a bunch of people who were passionate about building a better mobile money service. The office was a house. We\u2019d sit on the floor to discuss the business. We\u2019d brainstorm the product, mission, and impact while eating a simple local meal.\n\nFor our market research, we visited local markets and malls to talk to people. We\u2019d test our product and if a feature didn\u2019t work or people didn\u2019t like something, we\u2019d go back to the drawing board. In those early days, we had so many iterations and did many pilot tests before we actually launched our mobile money service. In Mbour, a popular fishing pier that we have made our home base, it was hard not to run into a Wave user or agent in late 2018.\n\nIn the first three months after product launch, we grew rapidly. When I first saw our numbers, I did a double-take. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. They seemed unreal. Fast forward three years. In 2021, more than half of Senegal\u2019s adult population actively uses Wave.\n\nMichael: How large is the Wave agent network across Senegal and Ivory Coast?\n\nCoura: We have a 25,000-agent network. In both Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire, we deliberately chose to partner with mobile money professionals. We could have built our own network from scratch but we believe strongly in adding value to the ecosystem by supporting existing players in the value chain. We want them to thrive.\n\nWe wanted to work with people who know the market, are familiar with the product, can detect fraud, etc. We are selective about our partners; we have zero intention of flooding the market with too many agents as they would not generate enough revenue. Both Wave users and agents need to be satisfied. Mobile money should be easy. Users shouldn\u2019t be inconvenienced. They shouldn\u2019t have to trek to find a service point. At the same time, agents need transaction volumes so they can earn a decent livelihood.\n\nMichael: In addition to low-cost transactions, what have the key drivers of growth been? Are there specific approaches that were crucial to getting people to use the service?\n\nCoura: Simplicity and a highly adapted solution. Any complexity is on us. People responded enthusiastically to Wave because we\u2019re 70% less expensive than telco-led mobile money.\n\nSecondly, we\u2019ve seen high user adoption thanks to our simple, easy-to-use, and highly adapted mobile money product. We always designed our service thinking how can we make this effortless for our users? Any complexity is on us. From a product point of view, we were inspired by a product like WhatsApp for its minimalistic design and effortless user experience. Lastly, we\u2019ve invested significant resources in customer service. We want to ensure that any needs or the occasional compliance of customers are resolved immediately.\n\n\n\nMichael: And what are some of the barriers to wider adoption of Wave? Have you had to deal with any regulatory challenges?\n\nCoura: We operate at the intersection of two highly regulated sectors, finance, and technology. At a regulatory level, we work with our partners to ensure that we\u2019re 100% compliant with rules and regulations. We also work hand-in-hand with our partner banks who have given great support.\n\nAs can be expected, there are often hiccups along the way. I\u2019ll give an example. According to regulators, fintechs, such as Wave, can sell value-added services, like airtime, on top of their platforms. Nevertheless, in March 2021, we were blocked by Orange to sell airtime. We believe this represents monopolistic behavior and have appealed to Senegal\u2019s telecoms regulator, ARTP. We are working tirelessly for it to be restored. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the same issue happened with the Telco companies. We hope that in a few years Wave, and fintechs in general, won\u2019t have to face such challenges. We aim for Francophone West Africa to become like East Africa where the telecoms have created a provider status for fintechs. In the end, we are advocating not just for Wave but for the whole fintech sector.\n\n\n\nMichael: Personally, what\u2019s been the toughest nut for you to crack as Wave\u2019s GM?\n\nCoura: It\u2019s been tough keeping up with growth. The product grew its own two legs and ran on its own \u2014 we\u2019ve had to catch up with it! (Laugh).\n\nSecondly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a challenge to stay focused. We have to be deliberate in what gets our attention. It can be too easy to become distracted by hype. It can be flattering or nice but we always have to circle back and ask if it moves the business forward. As Wave expands rapidly, we have to continually adapt our organisational structure to our growth goals and needs.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve done it well. We created a special company culture and style of our own. That I\u2019m extremely proud of.\n\nMichael: Senegal is regarded as one of the fastest-growing mobile money markets in Africa. But how large is the industry presently?\n\nCoura: Senegal is a dynamic market with different mobile money services operated by both telecom companies and banks. It has been favorable as the Senegalese are open to adopting products and services from new providers. However, Senegal is also a challenging market as there is significant competition. There are many other mobile money services, mainly offered by telecom companies. It\u2019s hard to give data about how large the industry is, as companies do not always give such data but I would say that at least 90% of adults in Senegal use one mobile money.\n\nMichael: Why do you think Francophone Africa is often ignored by the startup funding community?\n\nCoura: Francophone Africa has inherited the French system\u2019s bureaucracy, heavy administration, and governance style. Processes and regulations can be stricter than in other regions. As we\u2019re in the digital era, English has become the de facto language in technology, which might have made it more natural for investors to focus on Anglophone markets.\n\nBut nowadays, people are waking up to opportunities in Francophone Africa. If you take the region as a whole, which even shares the same currency, the CFA franc, investors start to appreciate that the total size of the market and the opportunities it presents outweigh any perceived challenges.\n\nMichael: Are there major differences you have observed between the markets where Wave operates?\n\nCoura: I think the big difference between Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal is the dynamism of the fintech ecosystem. There is definitely more appetite for digital in Senegal, which can even be described as a testing laboratory, but the potential is huge in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire thanks to a much larger Ivorian economy.\n\n\n\nMichael: On partnerships. Wave has a collaboration with UBA and Ecobank in Senegal. What informed these deals?\n\nCoura: According to regulations, fintechs can either have a mobile money license or work with a bank. It\u2019s natural for any startup to go the bank route and it was natural for us to partner with pan-African banks like UBA and Ecobank. They welcomed us with open arms. They are pro-innovation and pro-technology and were willing to support us in our mission to transform mobile money for the better.\n\nMichael: Do you see room for the integration of fintech, telco, and banks towards solving Africa\u2019s financial inclusion challenge?\n\nCoura: That\u2019s the way it should be. That\u2019s what Wave is here for and why we exist in the first place. Wave is part of the solution when it comes to tackling the challenge of financial inclusion in Africa. We are here to complement the banks and the De-Fi companies by going further in reaching people they cannot include financially\n\nMichael: What does the rest of the world need to learn from what\u2019s happening with mobile money in Africa?\n\nCoura: Africa\u2019s mobile money market is gigantic! People cannot grasp its true scale. In Africa, there are still hundreds of millions of people waiting to access financial services. Mobile money is still current as well as the next big thing. There is room to do more and improve.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

The FPIC law will also let them know the role of government and what it will do to back their investment in terms of profitability as no investors will be able to cut corners when it comes to investment in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe laws will enable communities to have the opportunity and platform to negotiate, make their demand from the investors and have a seamless process through the investment.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director of Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO), Kelvin Uwaibi said the workshop is necessary to create harmonization between communities, government, and investors to ensure economic development in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe really want to have a situation where the communities, local and state governments will work in harmony, as stipulated in the FPIC documents.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Armed bandits collected a multi-million naira ransom before they released the Emir of Bungudu in Zamfara State, Hassan Attahiru, family sources have said.\n\nThe bandits successfully negotiated the ransom with emirate officials despite the shutdown of telecommunications in the state. The ransom included a first payment of N20 million, after which the bandits refused to release the emir until they were given more money.\n\nThe Emir of Bungudu was kidnapped on the Kaduna-Abuja highway while travelling to Abuja. The Bungudu Emirate Council on Monday announced that he had returned home, 32 days after his kidnap.\n\nThe emir was abducted two weeks before the Kaduna State government asked telecommunications firms to suspend their services in part of the state from September 30.\n\nThe measure, which was aimed at checking the activities of bandits, was also adopted by the governments of Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto states.\n\nHowever, the absence of telecommunications services in Kaduna temporarily disrupted the negotiation and delayed the release of the emir.\n\nFamily sources told PREMIUM TIMES that negotiation began before the cut of telecommunications networks in parts of Kaduna State but continued afterwards until the emir was released.\n\nThe source said following the networks\u2019 shutdown, the bandits moved to areas where they could access mobile telecommunications services and continued pressing their demands.\n\nHowever, they could not connect the monarch with his loved ones and officials on phone as they usually did when they could access services from their strongholds.\n\n\u201cWe stopped speaking with the emir on the phone after the government announced the networks\u2019 shutdown in certain areas, until he eventually regained freedom,\u201d one of the family members who spoke to this newspaper, said.\n\nHow ransom was delivered\n\nThe sources said the bearer of the N20 million initially paid rode on a motorcycle for about three hours from Rigachikum town to the forest and trekked for another hour with the bag containing the money.\n\n\u201cThen, communication between the ransom bearer and the bandits broke with the bandits\u2019 phone numbers no longer accessible, so the ransom bearer returned to Kaduna with the money. However, upon his arrival in Kaduna, the bandits called and asked him to return to the forest with the money.\n\n\u201cWhen the ransom bearer moved further into the forest, he was asked to park his motorcycle at a certain place. The bandits were calling to give him direction until he delivered the ransom in a thicker forest covered by creeks,\u201d the source said.\n\nN20 million not enough\n\nThe source said after collecting N20 million from the ransom bearer, the kidnappers refused to release the monarch, demanding more money.\n\n\u201cThe kidnappers had demanded a N100 million ransom. The negotiation was going on when the networks were cut in parts of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cThe second ransom payment was also huge but I cannot ascertain the amount. Following the intervention of Miyetti Allah and others, the bandits agreed to free the monarch. But more ransom was paid,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cUpon his release, the emir trekked for about three hours in the forest before reaching a place where he was picked with a motorcycle and brought to where vehicles were parked waiting for his arrival,\u201d the source concluded.",

As at this morning, all the 12 were here and they have been deployed to the North-East.\n\n\u201cWe can see that the Tucano jets are actually game changer.\n\n\u201cMost of the successes we\u2019ve recorded in recent time is because of the acquisition of the new platforms, not limited to the super Tucano,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said with the recent notable successes recorded by the military on insecurity, he was amused by a story on Monday that the Nigerian Air Force paid N20 million to bribe bandits so that they would not bring down the president\u2019s aircraft.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the Air Force immediately debunked this because this exposes their ignorance.\n\n\u201cBetween Zamfara, Katsina, parts of Kaduna and Niger states, there are about 150 bandit camps. Who then was the money given to?\n\nHe also said the recommended conditions for the lifting of the suspension imposed on Twitter would be applicable to all Over-The-Top and other social media platforms in Nigeria.\n\nThe minister, who did not disclose the recommendations by the ministerial negotiation team to engage with Twitter on the suspension, said its report would be submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nMohammed, who headed the team, however, reiterated that the engagements with the microblogging and social media platform had been positive and fruitful.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that the recommendations we are going to make will not only be applicable to Twitter but they will be applicable to all OTTs and other social media platforms in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cToday, we are dealing with Twitter, we don\u2019t want a situation where we will be dealing with Facebook tomorrow and Instagram the next day. Our recommendations will be very comprehensive.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that during the 61st Independence anniversary celebration, the president said Twitter will return to Nigeria as soon as they meet the conditions of government.\n\n\u201cEven last night, the ministerial team met under my chairmanship and we reviewed the position of things.\n\n\u201cI want to say that we should wait for the committee to officially give its reports to the president but things are looking very positive and rosy.\n\n\u201cAfter submitting our reports and recommendations to the president, I will be disposed to say what we agreed and what have been met and what has not been met,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nNAN reports that following the indefinite suspension of its operations in Nigeria for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, Twitter had written to the president seeking engagement over the suspension.",

The second took place around 151 Battalion location where their gun truck ran over a Vehicle Improvised Explosive Device.\n\nFour terrorists died in each of the operations, the official added.\n\nFighting equipment such as AK 47 rifles, six magazines and 50 rounds of 7.62mm special were also recovered from them.\n\nAccording to the statement, the chief of Army staff, Faruk Yahaya, commended the efforts of the troops and urged them to be more focused.\n\n\u201cTroops of Joint Task Force North East Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) deployed alongside Cameroonian Defence Force have exterminated four ISWAP/BHTs at the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Wulgo, on 18 October 2021,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe vigilant troops successfully foiled an attempted infiltration of the terrorists group into the camp, while on a patrol to dominate their area of responsibility. The troops swiftly responded with overwhelming volume of fire and spontaneous reinforcement from the Battalion Headquarters, compelling the terrorists to retreat.\n\n\u201cTroops immediately carried out a hot pursuit and exploitation after the encounter, along the terrorists\u2019 route of withdrawal and neutralised three BHTs. The gallant troops also recovered three AK 47 rifles, six magazines and 50 rounds of 7.62mm special.\n\n\u201cIn another development, four ISWAP/BHTs terrorists have met their waterloo same date, around 151 Battalion location. The terrorists were burnt beyond recognition, as their Gun truck mounted with Anti Aircraft Guns ran over Vehicle Improvised Explosive Device.

          "text": "In November 2020 when Stella Ogene retired from the judicial service of Delta State in Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Niger Delta region, she had headed the state\u2019s Customary Court of Appeal for a record 21 years.\n\nIn addition to describing her as \u201cone of the best brains\u201d Delta State has contributed to the legal profession in Nigeria, the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, also suggested Mrs Ogene had set a track record of ethical conduct, challenging her successor, Patience Elumeze, to continue in that trajectory.\n\nBut hardly did the guests that gathered in Asaba, the state capital, that November afternoon at the event inaugurating her successor, know that Mrs Ogene operated a secret offshore company for several years in blatant breach of Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct laws.\n\nAnd even in what pushes the limit of impunity, publicly accessible Corporate Affairs Commission(CAC) records list her as a director of a private company for 10 years running.\n\nIn 2009, Mrs Ogene decided to venture into the London property market. However, for a public officer, she had a challenge: scaling the UK due diligence checks about her source of funds. She also needed to blindside the Nigerian Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) from determining an undeclared asset or an asset not attributable to fair income in accordance with Nigeria\u2019s law.\n\nTo scale these hurdles, she procured what experts call an envelope structure. To acquire the property without being detected, Mrs Ogene hid behind a company tucked away offshore.\n\nDocuments reviewed by PREMIUM TIMES showed that Justice Ogene was referred to Cook Worldwide, a financial secrecy seller with an office in Panama, a notorious tax haven, by Chike Obianaba, a British-Nigerian London property consultant.\n\nCook Worldwide acted fast and Assete Media Limited was born on September 7, 2009, with Mrs Ogene its beneficial owner, director, and secretary, the company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and a trove of other documents obtained by PREMIUM TIMES showed.\n\nIn helping Mrs Ogene to incorporate Assete Media Limited in Seychelles, Cook Worldwide hired Mayfair Trust Group Limited, a Mahe-Seychelles-based offshore service provider, the documents further revealed.\n\nThe pieces of information about Mrs Ogene\u2019s offshore secrets came from Pandora Papers, the landmark investigation into the vast amount of previously hidden offshore records of the super-rich and powerful, coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ.\n\nThe leaked records came from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients like Mrs Ogene, who seek to conceal their financial activities.\n\nThe investigation, which is the biggest collaboration of investigative journalists in history, involved 151 media outlets and more than 600 journalists from 117 countries who sifted through nearly 12 million leaked records, tracked down sources, and reviewed other public records.\n\nThe public records reviewed include UK Land Registry files to see how Nigerian serving and past public officers like Mrs Ogene, NPA acting chief Mohammed Bello-Koko, and former minister and serving senator Stella Oduah, among others, secretly invested in the London property market through shell companies. They continued to serve as directors of the shell companies even as public officers, thereby breaching Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct law.\n\nWhen first contacted by telephone, Mrs Ogene made a flat denial of her link with the shell company, Assete Media Limited. PREMIUM TIMES then sent her a further written note, describing the information we obtained, including a Cook Worldwide register of clients listing her as a sole director and secretary, letters she signed indicating she is the beneficial owner and an exact address of the London property she secretly bought.\n\nRealising the futility of further denial, Mrs Ogene then said, \u201cI am not a sole director or any director for that matter and I am just a nominal shareholder of Assete Media. In relation to the records of the letter you referred to written by me, it is outdated and obsolete and there are documents to that effect.\u201d\n\nIn another exchange with her, PREMIUM TIMES informed Mrs Ogene that her claim of not being a director of Assete Media was contradicted by records we obtained and then asked her to share whatever documents she has to counter the information we gathered. She has yet to respond to that request.\n\nEven if Mrs Ogene were an ordinary shareholder as she claimed, she was constitutionally bound to declare the company as well as the assets she owns through the company to the CCB. That point was made clear to her.\n\n\u24d8\n\nWe also asked her why she failed to abide by the provision of the Constitution despite being a judge (Section 11, Part of the Fifth Schedule). She declined to respond to the questions.\n\nThe London property\n\nHaving perfected the incorporation of a shell company in Seychelles, Mrs Ogene then entered the London property market.\n\nIn January 2010, four months after she began her offshore business, her shell company, Assete Media Limited, acquired a London property with the title MX58142 and address: 2 Old Rectory Gardens, Edgware HA8 7LS, UK Land Registry records show. The price paid was 224,000 pounds (about N43 million at the prevailing exchange rate).\n\nUsing a house price inflation calculator, that would make the property worth an estimated 400,000 pounds at the current prices.\n\nAs we understand, anonymous acquisition of the London property would ensure she circumvented due diligence checks in the UK about the sources of her funds as a public officer in Nigeria. Also, anonymity, that is, hiding behind her secret Seychelles-incorporated company, meant she could avoid possible investigation and prosecution in Nigeria for owning undeclared assets or acquiring as a judge any assets not attributable to legitimate income.\n\nMrs Ogene said Assete Media took a loan to acquire the London property. She declined to explain which bank advanced the loan.\n\nShe remains the ultimate beneficial owner of the London property to date.\n\nA judge as a lawbreaker\n\nIn incorporating Assete Media, apparently to secretly own a London property, Mrs Ogene tried to hide from law enforcers.\n\nBut in what further pushed the limits of impunity for a judicial official, Mrs Ogene for 10 years, while President of the Customary Court of Appeal, served as a director of a private company in Nigeria in breach of the law.\n\nOn April 19 2010, Mrs Ogene and members of her family \u2013 John Ogene, husband; Esse Ogene, daughter; and John Ogene Jr, son \u2013 registered Yellow Music Limited with registration number 882084 in Nigeria, company records obtained from the Corporate Affairs Commission, show. Mr Ogene is a professor of Arts history and graphics and deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Benin. By that action, the professor is also in breach of the law.\n\n\u24d8\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020 when Mrs Ogene retired from the judiciary, she remained director of Yellow Music, openly appearing in CAC records that are publicly accessible. She breached Section Six (6) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act.\n\n\u201cThe company (Yellow Music Limited) the company was set up for future use at that time which was never in use and had no financial dealings whatsoever,\u201d Mrs Ogene explained in her written statement to PREMIUM TIMES.\n\n\u201cIt was initially set up as a possible future venture into musical recordings for our son John Ogene Jr who is quite interested in music.\u201d\n\nShe did not respond to further questions concerning whether she declared her interest in Yellow Music and the offshore Assete Media to the CCB, as required by Section 11, Part of the Fifth Schedule of the 1999 Constitution.

The first prosecution witness has been in the witness box since November 6, 2018; and up until now, he hasn\u2019t finished giving his evidence.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that the defendant has the constitutional right to engage any counsel of his choice, but the counsel also has to have time for the case.\n\n\u201cIt is not proper that the defence counsel has to be the one fixing dates for this case\u201d, he further submitted.\n\nAtteh, therefore, asked the court for a date in November.\n\nHe also submitted that \u201cthe defendant can engage another lawyer, if his lawyer is unavailable so as not to waste the time of the court.\u201d\n\nJustice Oyefeso, in a short ruling, held that \u201cI have noted the concerns of the prosecution, and the SAN must devote time for this criminal charge.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that the case is completed expeditiously and without further excuses.\u201d\n\nThe matter was adjourned to November 15 and December 6, 2021 for continuation of trial.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

With today\u2019s Congress so peacefully conducted by the National Committee, we are set to rebuild APC in Abia State. Our doors are now wider open to receive all men and women of goodwill that desire to see our dear State take to the top.\n\n\u201cEven as we welcome all, our Exco shall not be a breeding ground for anti party activities or tolerate anyone who claims to be APC at day and other parties at night.

Since the beginning of the year, we see progress in the economic performance,\u201d Jihad Azour, director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the IMF, told AFP in an interview.\n\nBut \u201cthis recovery is not the same in all countries. It is uncertain and uneven because of the divergence in vaccination\u2026 and geopolitical developments\u201d, Azour added.\n\nThe IMF said this month that while prospects for oil-exporting economies improved with higher oil prices, low-income and crisis-hit countries are witnessing \u201cfragile\u201d recoveries.\n\nIt warned of \u201ca rise in social unrest\u201d in 2021 that \u201ccould pick up further due to repeated infection waves, dire economic conditions, high unemployment and food prices\u201d.\n\nUnemployment rates increased in MENA last year by 1.4 percent to reach 11.6 percent.\n\nThis rise exceeds that seen during the global financial crisis and the 2014-15 oil price shock, the IMF said.\n\nThe fund also warned of the longer-term risk of the uneven recovery, which could lead to a \u201cpermanent widening of existing wealth, income, and social gaps and, ultimately, weaker growth and less inclusive societies\u201d.\n\nAbout seven million more people in the region are estimated to have entered extreme poverty during 2020-21 compared to pre-crisis projections, according to the IMF.\n\nIn Lebanon, the continuing drop in the value of the currency has dashed hopes that the government formed last month can stem an economic crisis, branded by the World Bank as one of the worst since the mid-19th century.\n\nNearly 80 percent of the Lebanese population lives below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cThe Fund has already started technical discussions with the authorities\u2026 to develop what would be in fact that the framework within which the fund can help Lebanon,\u201d said Azour, a former Lebanese finance minister.",

          "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to block the release of documents related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection to a House committee investigating the attack, challenging President Joe Biden\u2019s initial decision to waive executive privilege.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit, Trump said the committee\u2019s August request was \u201calmost limitless in scope,\u201d and sought many records that weren\u2019t connected to the siege. He called it a \u201cvexatious, illegal fishing expedition\u201d that was \u201cuntethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,\u201d according to the papers filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit was expected, as he had said he would challenge the investigation and at least one ally, Steve Bannon, has defied a subpoena. But the legal challenge went beyond the initial 125 pages of records that Biden recently cleared for release to the committee. The suit, which names the committee as well as the National Archives, seeks to invalidate the entirety of the congressional request, calling it overly broad, unduly burdensome and a challenge to separation of powers. It requests a court injunction to bar the archivist from producing the documents.\n\nIn a joint statement late Monday, Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the panel\u2019s vice chairwoman, said they would fight the lawsuit, which they said is \u201cnothing more than an attempt to delay and obstruct\u201d the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of the White House accommodating congressional investigative requests when the public interest outweighs other concerns,\u201d Thompson and Cheney said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling public interest than trying to get answers about an attack on our democracy and an attempt to overturn the results of an election.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration, in clearing the documents for release, said the violent siege of the Capitol more than nine months ago was such an extraordinary circumstance that it merited waiving the privilege that usually protects White House communications.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit came the evening before the panel is scheduled to vote to recommend that Bannon be held in criminal contempt of Congress for his defiance of the committee\u2019s demands for documents and testimony. In a resolution released Monday, the committee asserts that the former Trump aide and podcast host has no legal standing to rebuff the committee, even as Trump\u2019s lawyer has asked him not to disclose information. Bannon was a private citizen when he spoke to Trump ahead of the attack, the committee said, and Trump has not asserted any such executive privilege claims to the panel itself.\n\nThe resolution lists many ways in which Bannon was involved in the leadup to the insurrection, including reports that he encouraged Trump to focus on Jan. 6, the day Congress certified the presidential vote, and his comments on Jan. 5 that \u201call hell is going to break loose\u201d the next day.\n\n\u201cMr. Bannon appears to have played a multi-faceted role in the events of January 6th, and the American people are entitled to hear his first-hand testimony regarding his actions,\u201d the committee wrote.\n\nOnce the committee votes on the Bannon contempt resolution, it will go to the full House for a vote and then on to the Justice Department, which would decide whether to prosecute.\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Associated Press, the White House also worked to undercut Bannon\u2019s argument. Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote that the president\u2019s decision on the documents applied to Bannon, too, and \u201cat this point we are not aware of any basis for your client\u2019s refusal to appear for a deposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s determination that an assertion of privilege is not justified with respect to these subjects applies to your client\u2019s deposition testimony and to any documents your client may possess concerning either subject,\u201d Su wrote to Bannon\u2019s lawyer.\n\nBannon\u2019s attorney said he had not yet seen the letter and could not comment on it. While Bannon has said he needs a court order before complying with his subpoena, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former White House and Pentagon aide Kashyap Patel have been negotiating with the committee. It is unclear whether a fourth former White House aide, Dan Scavino, will comply.\n\nThe committee has also subpoenaed more than a dozen people who helped plan Trump rallies ahead of the siege, and some of them have already said they would turn over documents and give testimony.\n\nLawmakers want the testimony, and the documents, as part of their investigation into how a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, a violent effort to halt the certification of Biden\u2019s election win. The committee demanded a broad range of executive branch papers related to intelligence gathered before the attack, security preparations during and before the siege, the pro-Trump rallies held that day and Trump\u2019s false claims that he won the election, among other matters.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit says the \u201cboundless requests included over fifty individual requests for documents and information, and mentioned more than thirty individuals, including those working inside and outside government.\u201d\n\nThe files must be withheld, the lawsuit says, because they could include \u201cconversations with (or about) foreign leaders, attorney work product, the most sensitive of national security secrets, along with any and all privileged communications among a pool of potentially hundreds of people.\u201d\n\nThe suit also challenges the legality of the Presidential Records Act, arguing that allowing an incumbent president to waive executive privilege of a predecessor just months after they left office is inherently unconstitutional. Biden has said he would go through each request separately to determine whether that privilege should be waived.\n\nWhile not spelled out in the Constitution, executive privilege has developed to protect a president\u2019s ability to obtain candid counsel from his advisers without fear of immediate public disclosure and to protect his confidential communications relating to official responsibilities.\n\nBut that privilege has had its limitations in extraordinary situations, as exemplified during the Watergate scandal, when the Supreme Court ruled it could not be used to shield the release of secret Oval Office tapes sought in a criminal inquiry, and following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMonday\u2019s lawsuit was filed by Jesse Binnall, an attorney based in Alexandria, Virginia, who represented Trump in an unsuccessful lawsuit late last year seeking to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Nevada. Trump and his allies have continued to make baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s suit quotes from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in a case by House committees seeking the then-sitting president\u2019s tax returns and other financial records. But that case involved courts enforcing a congressional subpoena. The high court in that case directed lower courts t o apply a balancing test to determine whether to turn over the records \u2014 it\u2019s still pending.\n\nWhite House spokesman Mike Gwin said, \u201cAs President Biden determined, the constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself.\u201d\n\nAP",
          "summary": "In a federal lawsuit, Trump said the committee\u2019s August request was \u201calmost limitless in scope,\u201d and sought many records that weren\u2019t connected to the siege.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of the White House accommodating congressional investigative requests when the public interest outweighs other concerns,\u201d Thompson and Cheney said.\nBannon was a private citizen when he spoke to Trump ahead of the attack, the committee said, and Trump has not asserted any such executive privilege claims to the panel itself.\nIn a letter obtained by The Associated Press, the White House also worked to undercut Bannon\u2019s argument.\nIt is unclear whether a fourth former White House aide, Dan Scavino, will comply.",

          "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Interior Affairs has said girls will be allowed to return to secondary schools soon.\n\nSaeed Khosty, a spokesman for the interior ministry, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the exact timing will be announced by the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cFrom my understanding and information, in a very short time all the universities and schools will be reopened and all the girls and women will return to school and their teaching jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan, teenage girls were told to stay home from school until a \u201csafe learning environment\u201d could be established. But boys in all grades and girls of primary age were told to return to school.\n\nThe exclusion of older girls has aggravated fears that the Taliban could be returning to their hardline rule of the 1990s, when women and girls were legally barred from education and employment.\n\nKhosti \u201cindicated that it was imminent that girls in secondary schools and their female teachers would be returning very soon,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Kabul.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been hearing from the Taliban since they took power. Yes, they\u2019re going to return. But it\u2019s going to take time. And of course, that\u2019s taking a toll on a lot of the girls,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey want to go back to school, they want to continue their studies. This is also one of the demands of the international community for the Taliban to protect and safeguard the rights of girls and women to go to school and to work.\u201d\n\nWhen the Taliban took power in August, the armed group promised to uphold the rights of girls and women. But its actions since have worried the international community.\n\nIt has sent mixed signals about women returning to work in government offices and has forced universities to enact policies of gender segregation in order to reopen.\n\nIt also named an all-male cabinet, saying women could be included later.\n\nAntonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, earlier this month condemned the Taliban\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d promises to Afghan women and girls and appealed to the group to fulfil their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.\n\n\u201cBroken promises leads to broken dreams for the women and girls of Afghanistan,\u201d the UN chief said. \u201cWomen and girls need to be in the centre of attention.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s rollback of women\u2019s rights has also prompted criticism from Qatar and Pakistan, which have called on the international community to engage with the Taliban.\n\nAt a news conference last month, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said it \u201chas been very disappointing to see some steps being taken backwards\u201d by the Taliban.\n\nAl Thani said Qatar, which hosts the Taliban\u2019s political office, should be used as a model for how a Muslim society can be run. \u201cOur system is an Islamic system [but] we have women outnumbering men in workforces, in government and in higher education.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan meanwhile said that although he doubted the Taliban would once again place an outright ban on girls\u2019 education, the group should be reminded that Islam would never allow such a thing to happen again.\n\n\u201cThe idea that women should not be educated is just not Islamic. It has nothing to do with religion,\u201d Khan told the BBC media outlet.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Bandits Massacre 40 in Sokoto Market, Buhari Declares Total War",
          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in parts of the country, saying their days are numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 40 people by bandits at Goronyo market, in Sokoto State, sent a tough warning to the criminals and declared, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari had earlier taken a critical look at the security situation in the country before news of the massacre in Sokoto State filtered in. He had boasted that the military and other security agencies were recording greater successes in the bid to rid the country of insecurity.\n\nThe president, however, counselled the Nigerian media on the need for accurate reportage of security and safety issues by replacing the usage of phrases, like \u201crising insecurity\u201d, with \u201cdeclining insecurity\u201d.\n\nBut in Kaduna State, security forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area.\n\nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, reacting to the killing in his state, called on the Nigeria Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to help stamp out banditry in the region.\n\nIn a similar vein, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concerns about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in schools across the country.\n\nUnited States reiterated its readiness to lend support to Nigeria in its bid to contain insecurity.\n\nBuhari, in a release by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, declared, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before.\u201d\n\nBuhari added, \u201cThe bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to Nigerians not to despair, because his administration was determined, more than ever before, to protect Nigerians from murderous criminal gangs with no respect for the sanctity of human of life. He extended his sympathy to the families of the victims of the Goronyo attack and called on the people to remain patient, as the military strategised on how to crush the bandits.\n\nIn yet another presidential message by Shehu, to felicitate with the Muslim Ummah, Nigerians of all faiths and the followers of Islam all over the world on the occasion of Maulud-Un-Nabiyy, Buhari gave a snapshot of the increased activities of the armed forces, the police, and intelligence agencies to effectively respond to the security challenges in the country. He said the increased cooperation from the citizenry, coupled with reinvigorated, dynamic, and energised police, security and military leadership was helping the administration score more victories against terror, criminality, and economic sabotage.\n\nHe argued that the reality of declining insecurity should replace the inaccurate narrative of rising insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform, who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more,\u201d Buhari said. \u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the government expected and intended for those trends to continue, and called on the media to address the tone, content, and standards of reporting on security and safety measures.\n\nHe said the time had come for the media to revise the prefixes \u201crising insecurity\u201d with \u201cdeclining insecurity.\u201d\n\nIn his felicitation with the Muslim Ummah to mark the Eid-Ul-Maulud on Tuesday, which has been declared a public holiday throughout the federation, Buhari said, \u201cI am delighted to send greetings of peace, unity and goodwill to the Muslim Ummah, fellow citizens, and Muslims all over the world as they observe and celebrate Eid-ul- Maulud.\u201d\n\nHe urged Muslims to strive for \u201cforgiveness and closeness to the noble life and teachings of the Prophet (SAW), whose birthday is being marked on this blessed day. On this auspicious occasion, I wish you all the blessings of today.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than 40 people were killed as suspected bandits attacked a market in Goronyo Local Government Area of Sokoto State. The armed men attacked the market on Sunday, which happened to be the market day.\n\nSources in the village said the marauders attacked the market in large numbers and started shooting sporadically, leading to the death of over 40 persons.\n\nA source, which spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the casualty figure was over 40, as the area was still unsafe for residents to access. The attack was the third in the area in two weeks.\n\nLast Thursday, suspected members of the outlawed volunteer vigilante group, also known as Yan Sakai, attacked and killed nine Fulanis at Manmade market in Gwadabawa Local Government Area of the state. Suspected bandits also killed 20 persons at Ungwan Lalle market, in Sabon Birni Local government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe Sokoto State government had earlier ordered the closure of markets in the Eastern Senatorial District of the state as a measure to fight the rising insecurity in the state.\n\nTambuwal Calls for Coordinated Operations in Sokoto\n\nSokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal called on the Nigerian Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to stamp out banditry in the region. Tambuwal made the call on Monday, when the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Sokoto, the state capital.\n\nThe governor disclosed that the operations of the army in Zamfara State were having a negative effect on Sokoto State, especially, the Eastern part of the state, hence the need to carry out the operations simultaneously.\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday and today, we have lost many people in Goronyo Local Government Area of the state,\u201d he said, adding that before now, the situation in the state was not as bad. He appealed to the Nigerian Army to review its operations in the state.\n\nThe governor also asked the Chief of Army staff to deploy more troops, resources, and intelligence to the state to end the banditry. He promised that his administration would do everything in its powers to support the security agencies to end insecurity in the state.\n\nEarlier, Yahaya commended Tambuwal for his support to security agencies in the state. The army chief, who was in Sokoto, his home state, on his first visit since his assumption of office as Chief of Army Staff, said he was in the state as part of a familiarisation tour to divisions across the country. The purpose, he said, was to interact with troops and encourage them on their duties as well as hold security meetings with governors and relevant stakeholders.\n\nHe said the perpetrators of criminal activities across the country were also human, and said there was need to work with everyone to track down the criminals among the people.\n\nIn a related development, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, prayed for the continuous success of the security agencies against criminal elements in the country. While receiving Yahaya in his palace, the Sultan said he was always happy to receiving army personnel, having being one of them before ascending the throne. He disclosed that Sultan\u2019s Palace remained home to everyone, not only the army chief, but every Nigerian, irrespective of where they came from or their religious background.\n\nThe Sultan said his council would continue to pray for the army chief and his people, saying the task before them is more than the civil war era\n\nBenue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concern about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in the country. Ortom spoke on Monday at his country house, Gbajimba, in Guma Local Government Area, during the virtual handing over and commissioning of a Government Science Secondary School built by some oil companies in the country, including Chevron, Famfa, Prime, and Equinor.\n\nHe said education remained the bedrock of growth and development of any nation, wondering why schools should be the target of criminals.\n\nThe governor lauded the oil companies for investing heavily in the education sector as part of their social responsibility policy. He pledged, on behalf of his government, that everything in its powers would be done to protect the facility and announced immediate perimeter fencing of the school.\n\nThe governor also decried the high number of internally displaced persons in the area and urged the federal government to do everything to ensure that the people returned to their homes.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will not keep quiet and allow some group of people chase my people away from their homes and continue to make them IDPs. Gbajimba has over 500,000 IDPs. I appeal to the federal government to stop these herdsmen and declare them a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThey should stop the killing and destruction of our property. I will not engage any militia group but seek justice of my people.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a mandatory responsibility of every government. I want to appreciate the recent effort made by government in nipping insecurity in the bud, especially, in the state but it should be sustained.\n\n\u201cI also appreciate the effort of security agencies, who are sacrificing their lives to ensure peace in our state. The federal government should do massive recruitment and adequate funding of security agencies so that they can put in their best in securing the lives of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode in Abuja, George Okoh In Makurdi, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari and former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, have extended the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the United States President, Joe Biden, and the people of America over the demise of a former US Secretary of State, General Colin Powell.\n\nThey expressed their feelings over the demise of Powell in separate statements yesterday.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, said he believed that as the first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the US Department of Defense as well as the first African-American Secretary of State, Powell was a great statesman and a global icon in every sense of it.\n\nHe recounted that as US Secretary of State, Powell played a very important role in advancing his country\u2019s foreign policy and national defence interests as well as being a great advocate of the eradication of Polio and addressing the deadly spread of HIV/AIDS disease in Africa.\n\nBuhari said his prayers and thoughts were with Powell\u2019s family and the people of the United States as they mourned the death of an exceptional leader and one of America\u2019s greatest prides, who as a professional soldier, a distinguished public servant and an effective diplomat, gave his utmost for his country.\n\nObasanjo, in his message, described the death of Powell as a loss not only to the America, but to the entire world, stressing that the late Powell was a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-arm, whose closeness as an African-American with the mother Africa assisted in the growth of the continent.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said, \u201cGeneral Powell\u2019s tenure in office marked a significant departure from the traditional relations between Africa and the United States.\n\n\u201cHe was Secretary of State under the administration of President George W. Bush, Jnr, part of the time I was President of Nigeria. He was not just an African-American, he was an African-American, who understood Africa. That is what I found in him, when he was Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cWith him, among others, I have always seen advantage in the closeness of the African-Americans with the mother Africa. It is mutually good and beneficial for the Africans at home and for our brothers and sisters in diaspora in the US, Caribbean or Southern America.\n\n\u201cI cherished our relationship for the good of humanity in general and especially, for the good of our race, which collectively is the most abused, despised and disregarded race in modern history. He was indeed a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-Arm,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former president noted that the news of Powell\u2019s death was received with sadness, adding, \u201chis death is a great loss not only to his immediate family and to the United States of America but also to the entire world.\n\n\u201cThough the world, particularly Africa, would miss him, his legacies would continue to inspire many to reach the highest points of their productive, political and creative abilities. May God grant his soul perfect peace and rest.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Jonathan in a tribute personally signed, described late Powell as a renowned United States public servant and great leader, who left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time.\n\nHe also stated that his stellar military career paved the way for other African Americans to reach for the top, because he articulated a new paradigm for engaging in military action.\n\nThe former President, in a statement by his Special Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, stated: \u201cUntil the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, Colin Powel was the highest ranking African-American to have served in the public sector of the United States. In that capacity, he served as a beacon of hope and was a pride of the Black Race.\n\n\u201cHis stellar military career, which saw him become the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which pivoted him to also becoming the first US Secretary of State of colour, paved the way for other African-Americans to reach for the top. His articulation of the Powell Doctrine gave the United States, and the world at large, a new paradigm for engaging in military action with honour and decorum.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of State, he was known for his tactful management of America\u2019s foreign relations, of which he extended a right hand of fellowship to the Yar\u2019Adua administration, when I was Vice President.\n\n\u201cHis death, at 84 after a long, useful and fulfilled life, is mourned by my family and I, as well as the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation. He left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time, and would be greatly missed. Our prayers are with his family at this trying time for them.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Minister of External Affairs, Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, said his admiration for the late Powell was usually for his astute military insights and less for his political performance.\n\nThe former Director General of the Nigeria Institute International Affairs (NIIA) explained that, \u201cFor instance, while evicting Sadam Hussain\u2019s military from Kuwait, he declared it would be a strategic mistake to overthrow Sadam himself. That view has been vindicated. That he got roped into the weapons of mass destruction deception is the stuff of politics, which perhaps explains his disdain of it.\n\n\u201cThe second reason for my admiration is what is now referred to as the Colin Powell doctrine about the need of \u2018overwhelming force\u2019 to guarantee military victory. In this respect, I recall a debate about the appropriate size of the Nigerian army in the aftermath of the Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cLeading the side for downsizing were military Hawks like Gen TY Danjuma (and some of his colleagues in the Ruling Council) who saw a \u2018small compact and mobile Force\u2019 as being more economical for national defence arrangement,\u201d Akinyemi explained.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that then, in opposition was a group whose prominent advocate was himself, saying he preferred a large military for purposes of National defence.\n\nAkinyemi said he had argued then that there could be circumstances when only overwhelming force could win a war (a sort of Colin Powell doctrine).\n\n\u201cSuch circumstances as when a nation is besieged by guerilla warfare that overstretches the military. The military proponents decided to prune the military from about a quarter of a million men to about 100 thousand.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta",
