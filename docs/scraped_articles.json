          "text": "There was confusion on Monday over Sunday\u2019s meeting of the South-West All Progressives Congress leaders as invitation to the excluded the party\u2019s key stakeholders in the zone.\n\nIn the notice of the meeting signed by a former National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, those invited to the meeting included the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; a former Ogun State Governor, Chief Segun Osoba, Gen. Alani Akinrinade (retd); the Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and the Minister of Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo and another party leader, Chief Pius Akinyelure.\n\nOther are the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu; his Ekiti State counterpart, Kayode Fayemi; Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State; the Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola; Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu of Lagos State and the Chairman of the Police Service Commission, Alhaji Musiliu Smith.\n\nA chieftain of the party, who confided in one of our correspondents, said he did not understand why the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and his counterpart for Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, were not invited to the meeting.\n\nAnother top official of the APC, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stated, \u201cIf two former governors were at the meeting, I expected the ministers to be there. They are key stakeholders too.\u201d\n\nMr Lani Baderinwa, an aide in charge of Public Communication for Chief Bisi Akande, could not be reached for comment on the matter.\n\nCalls to his line did not go through and the reply to text message sent to him on whether the ministers were invited , was still being expected as of the time of filing this report.\n\nAlso, Sola Fasure, an aide to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, did not respond to text message asking if the ex Osun governor was invited. He did not pick calls to his mobile line as of the time of filing this report.\n\nSimilarly, Hakeem Bello, the spokesman for the Minister for Works and Housing could not be reached.\n\nHowever, one of his former aides in Lagos, who declined to be named, said the minister did not mention about the meeting.\n\n\u201cI cannot say if he was invited or not; he never mention a meeting in Lagos to us,\u201d he said.\n\nBut a source the meeting who spoke to one of our correspondents, said there was no hidden agenda in exclusion of some key stakeholders.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is just the first in a series of meetings. They were not invited to this one because the issue at hand at the moment is internal.\n\n\u201cThis is like foundation laying, they will be invited subsequently. The fact that they were not invited to this one is not to slight anyone.\u201d\n\nFayemi, Akeredolu endorse S\u2019west APC leaders\u2019 decisions\n\nMeanwhile, Fayemi on Monday expressed support for the resolutions of the APC South-West leaders.\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Yinka Oyebode, who said the governor was not aware of the meeting due to \u201cmix up in the invitation sent out,\u201d said Fayemi was in total support of the decisions at the meeting.\n\nOyebode said, \u201cThe absence of an invitation for the South-West APC leaders meeting prevented the governor from attending the meeting, as he was not aware.\n\n\u201cGovernor Fayemi, as a true democrat and South-West leader who is committed to the welfare of the people, is, however, in total support of the decisions reached by the South-West leaders at the meeting which include an endorsement of the positions earlier adopted by the southern governors on the ban on open grazing and the need for true federalism, among others.\n\n\u201cFor clarity, the invitation for the meeting which was said to have been sent via Whatsapp by Mr Tunde Rahman, an aide to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, never got to Governor Fayemi.\n\nAlso, Akeredolu said lack of \u201ctimeous communication and aside mix up,\u201d were largely responsible for his inability to attend the meeting.\u201d\n\nIn statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olabode Olatunde, on Monday, the governor said he had thrown his weight behind the outcome of the meeting.\n\nThe statement reads partly, \u201cGovernor Akeredolu would have loved to be present at the meeting for several reasons. However, a slight mix-up and communication gap had caused his unintended absence even as an earlier engagement had been fixed for Ibadan weeks before the meeting.\n\n\u201cAs one of the leaders of the APC in the South-West, and more so that, he presided over the Asaba meeting of the southern governors, nothing could be more spirit-lifting than the outcome of the Lagos meeting on Sunday. He, therefore, endorses all the resolutions reached by the leaders who attended the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Senate leader, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice, said on Monday that he was not involved.\n\nAkintoye warns APC leaders\n\nThe President, Ilana Omo Oodua, Prof. Banji Akintoye, has warned the APC leaders that attended the South-West Forum meeting on Sunday in Lagos, not to stand against the interests of the Yoruba.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Akintoye said, \u201cIt is a pity that in rejecting the Yoruba nation state and clinging to Nigeria, they have taken a decision which they are certain to regret.\n\n\u201cMy prayer is that when they come to regret it, they will have the courage to change it and thereby re-establish themselves in the swelling current of Yoruba thought, Yoruba desire, and Yoruba expectations.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2022Over 100 victims in Benue killed by killer herders\n\n\u2022Gana loyalists connive in 4 Wards of Katsina-Ala LGA\n\n\u202216 killed in 2 LGAs in Plateau\n\n\u2022Protesters block Karina-Suleja-Abuja highway over\n\nabduction of 15 women, children\n\nBy Wole Mosadomi, Peter Duru, Johnbosco Agbakwuru & Mary Therese-Nanlong\n\nBENUE \u2014 No fewer than 116 persons were weekend killed by killer herders in communities in Benue and Plateau states.\n\nWhile over 100 were killed in four wards in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State by a combination of killer herders, who acted in connivance with loyalists of late militia leader, Terwase Agwaza, alias Gana, 16 had their lives snuffed out in Jos North and Riyom Local Government Areas of Plateau State. These came as hundreds of angry youths yesterday blocked the Karina-Suleja-Abuja highway, following the attack of their communities by bandits who abducted 15 persons, mainly women and children.\n\nIn the Benue killing, Vanguard gathered from a reliable source in the area who spoke on condition of anonymity, that the gangs had between Saturday and Sunday invaded and sacked several communities at Yooyo, Utange, Mbatura/Mberev and Mbayongo Council Wards in the LGA.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019Since Saturday, communities in four council Wards have come under severe attacks by armed herdsmen who are supported by a local militia gang made up of loyalists of late Terwase Agwaza, alias Gana.\n\n\u201cThe villages and communities in the four council Wards have been like war zones since Saturday. The militia gangs moved from one community to another shooting sporadically, killing and looting the properties of the people. \u201cThe development has created pandemonium of unimaginable proportion in Katsina-Ala LGA. The gangs have adopted the commando-style attacks to kill unsuspecting farmers.\n\n\u201cThey attack a community and before the military and security personnel arrive the scene, they pull out and invade another community.\n\n\u201cAs we speak so many persons have been killed between Saturday and Sunday, and the people are fleeing and running for several kilometres to safer places and communities but the fear is that nobody knows the next community that would be invaded.\u2019\u2019\n\nConfirming the development, Chairman of Katsina-Ala LGA, Mr. Alfred Atera, said the situation and manner of attacks might have overwhelmed the military and security personnel on ground in Katsina-Ala. He said:\u201cThe herdsmen have developed a strategy. They are not attacking just one place; they have been attacking from one place to the other. If they attack Kwaghaondo, the next thing you hear is that they are attacking Utange.\n\n\u201cFour Council Wards are under attack by the herdsmen. They include Yooyo, Utange, Mbatura/Mberev and Mbayongo Council Wards.\n\n\u201cMore than 100 people have been killed at different places. I told the military that the attackers have developed a strategy of attacking from one place to the other. \u201cSo the military and security personnel are going here and there. But before they get to a place, the attackers had finished and gone to another point, that is the situation in Katsina-Ala.\n\n\u201cThe authorities are aware of all these things. As I am speaking to you, my traditional rulers are here to see what we can do at our own level.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent, DSP, Catherine Anene, said she was yet to receive reports of the incident from the Divisional Police Officer, DPO, for Katsina-Ala LGA.\n\nOn his part, the Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke, Brig. Gen. Clement Apere, said \u201cthe narrative is not true.\u201d\n\nKatsina-Ala LGA is one of the three LGAs that constitute Sankera axis of the state which is known as the food basket of the nation.\n\nContacted, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, Colonel Paul Hemba, retd, said \u2018\u2019though security personnel claimed there was nothing like that \u201c a team of military personnel, the local government council chairman and myself would Tuesday (today) visit the communities for on-the-spot assessment, after which a formal statement would be issued on the matter.\u201d\n\nVanguard recalls that Governor Samuel Ortom had at the weekend, raised the alarm that the ceaseless invasion of Benue communities had taken its toll on the economy of the state and also created serious food shortages across the state.\n\n16 killed in 2 LGAs in Plateau\n\nIn Plateau State, 16 persons, mainly women and children, were killed in two separate attacks in Jos North and Riyom Local Government Areas of Plateau State by men suspected to be herders.\n\nThe attack in Dong village of Jos North occurred at about 8.00 p.m. on Sunday as the village came under siege with sporadic gunshots.\n\nThe Village Head, Daniel Choji, said the attackers came under the cover of darkness to unleash terror on the community, adding that the attack left eight persons dead, comprising five females, two males, and an infant.\n\nIn another attack in Kwi village of Riyom Local Government Area, just about a kilometre to the Yakubu Gowon Airport, the attackers invaded the community on Sunday night, leaving eight people dead and one injured. The member representing the Constituency in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Timothy Dantong, confirmed that four males and four females were killed in the attack.\n\nDantong, who described the attack as barbaric, senseless and inhuman, also called on security operatives to live up to their responsibilities by responding to distress calls early to ensure that perpetrators of the heinous acts were apprehended and brought to book. The State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Dan Manjang, and the senator representing Plateau North senatorial zone, Istifanus Gyang, also confirmed the attacks.\n\nReacting to the killings, Manjang said: \u201cPlateau State government is deeply saddened by the recurrence of violence in parts of Dong Kasa in Jos North Local Government Area and Kwi in Riyom on Sunday night where innocent citizens including children and women were murdered in cold blood.\n\n\u2018\u2019The act is barbaric, callous and a desperate attempt to rupture the peace and security of the state.\u201d\n\nWhile commiserating with families that lost loved ones and valuables in the two separate attacks, he added:\u201cThe governor, Simon Lalong, is deeply distressed by the incident and has vowed to ensure that the cherished values of peace and security and the sanctity of lives remains sacrosanct in the state.\n\n\u2018\u2019The administration would continue to take measures and work hand in hand with security agencies to protect the lives and property of citizens.\u201d\n\nHe said as soon as the government was alerted about the attack, it quickly reached out to security agencies who responded immediately and had been in pursuit of the attackers, with a view to apprehending and bringing them to justice.\n\nThe commissioner reiterated that the capacity of the security agencies for rapid response and intervention would be boosted once the approved 50 patrol vehicles and 200 security motorcycles are supplied.\n\nAlso reacting, Gyang, who is the Senator representing the two areas, said: \u201cShortly after the IGP issued a security alert on likely terror attacks on Jos and the FCT, the blood merchants have visited terror on Dong community adjacent Wild Life Park, Jos and Kwi village, adjacent Yakubu Gowon Airport Heipang on Sunday night, where 16 persons were butchered to dead, including children.\u2019\u2019\n\nSenator Gyang, whose constituency and constituents, had been victims of sustained attacks, loss of lives and displacement from ancestral homes, condemned in strong terms the renewed attacks, describing same as \u201cdastardly, wicked and unwarranted.\u201d\n\nThe senator in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media/Protocol, Musa Ashoms, noted with concern that \u201cavailable information indicates that some persons at a meeting with the Police the week preceding the attacks vowed to visit mayhem on helpless communities.\n\n\u2018\u2019 It is, therefore, incumbent on the Plateau State Police Commissioner to arrest and prosecute those very persons forthwith,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe further called for \u201cdecisive action against all those that are known to security agencies, the OPSH, Police and the DSS for the serial killings, displacement and forceful occupation of ancestral homelands of communities in Plateau North as inaction on this matter will amount to condoning criminal act and complicity.\n\nSpokesman of the state police command, Gabriel Ubah, said the command received a distress call from the community and responded with the deployment of a combined team of security personnel, led by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, to repel the attackers. He added that security personnel had been deployed to the affected areas to forestall a breakdown of law and order.\n\nProtesters block Karina-Suleja-Abuja highway over abduction of 15 women, children\n\nIn Niger State, angry youths of Gauraka community in Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State yesterday blocked Abuja-Kaduna highway to protest the series of abductions in the community.\n\nGautama community is located along Abuja-Kaduna highway. The protesters halted movement of traffic on the highway while burning tyres to create a scene.\n\nThe community is protesting the abduction of some residents by gunmen.\n\nThey said about 30 persons from the community were currently in kidnappers\u2019 den, and that their abductors were demanding a huge ransom.\n\nThe protesters said they embarked on the action to call the attention of the relevant authorities to their plight after gunmen invaded the community early yesterday, around 1:00 am and abducted 15 persons.\n\nSpeaking during the protest, a member of the community, who identified himself as Hassan Hassan, said the gunmen invaded the community around 1:17am and abducted 15 persons. He said they decided to protest to ask the government to come to their rescue in Niger State.\n\n\u201cAt exactly 1:17am in the morning, I heard a gunshot. I had to quickly close my windows because they were opened. I told my people at home to be calm.\n\n\u201cI went to my toilet to see what was happening. I saw that the gunmen were taking my neighbour with his two children. One is 10 years old and the second is 8 years old.\n\n\u201cThey operated till around 1:51am. Around 2:15am, the army came to our rescue. Some of us came out to see those who were kidnapped.\n\n\u2018\u2019We discovered that they have kidnapped about 15 persons and cut the two hands and ear of one woman who was carrying a baby. \u201cThis is not the first time. This is not the second time. We just want to know if we are safe in this country and Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAnother member of the community, who identified himself as Dare, said last Thursday, gunmen kidnapped four persons in the community, adding that they were demanding a N10 million ransom. He said when the community informed a nearby police station about the incident, they were told that there was no ammunition and vehicle to repel the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Niger State governor, Sani Bello, yesterday met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe governor\u2019s meeting with President Buhari came on the heels of the protest by hundreds of citizens in his state who blocked the Abuja-Kaduna expressway in Gauraka town, protesting rampant kidnapping in the area.\n\nThe governor, who recently announced that Boko Haram had hoisted its flag after taking territories in the state, was accompanied by Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, NGF, and governor of Ekiti state, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, National Caretaker Committee and Yobe state governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlthough the agenda of the meeting was not disclosed to journalists at the time of filing this report, it was gathered it was in connection with the heightened insecurity in Niger State.\n\nProtesters took to the highway in Gauraka, town Monday blocking the expressway and causing traffic gridlock that extended for a few kilometers along the Abuja-Kaduna expressway.\n\nAfter the meeting with the President that lasted over one hour, the governors declined to speak to journalists when he was approached on his way out of the President\u2019s office on the agenda of the visit to the Presidential Villa.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

However, it was not totally burnt down. Only one room was burnt and personnel of the Neighbourhood Watch in the council area were quick at securing the official documents in the office thereby preventing them from being burnt.\n\n\u201cThe watch personnel scaled the fence to put out the fire before the arrival of fire service workers from both Udenu, and Nsukka Local Government Areas. The hoodlums could not get access to the INEC facilities because the premises was locked.\n\n\u201cThe suspected miscreants set the facility on fire around few minutes past 12 am on Monday morning and ran away. I can tell you that no casualty was recorded.\u201d\n\n3 feared dead in Awka INEC Hqters attack\n\nOn the Anambra attack that happened Sunday night, it was learnt that three people were feared dead while seven vehicles, 50 generating sets and other equipment belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in Awka were burnt.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Chris Owolabi who confirmed the incident yesterday while briefing newsmen at INEC State Headquarters, Awka, disclosed that the defensive counter attack launched against the attackers on the spot by the combattle ready policemen recorded 95 percent success, which led to the recovery of arms and ammunition from the hoodlums.\n\nOwolabi who did not provide casualty figures as according to him, investigations were still in progress, however noted that none of his men lost his life during the encounter.\n\nAccording to the CP,, \u201cI got a call around 8.15am that my B-division was under attack by armed hoodlums and there were lots of firing of guns and disturbance of public peace. My men there defended themselves and resisted the hoodlums very strongly.\n\n\u201cWe all knew it was a ploy to attack INEC office. So, we proceeded to the office where we were able to engage the hoodlums and demobilized the three vehicles they came with which made them scamper for safety.\u201d\n\nAlthough unconfirmed reports said four of the attackers were gunned down, the Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Christopher Owolabi told reporters that the command had started combing hospitals in and around Awka for the wounded attackers who allegedly fled with injuries.\n\nThe attack, which started at about 9pm on Sunday caused pandemonium in the Anambra State capital as sound of gunshots could be heard several kilometres away. Many people who were at a popular night club around the Ekwueme Square had to spend the night there as the fireworks could not allow them to drive home.\n\nAccording to Owolabi, the police recorded over 90 percent success in the battle against the attackers, adding that the hoodlums were forced to abandon three hilux vans they came with.\n\nOwolabi said: \u201cThe hoodlums first went to \u201cB\u201d division police station and were repelled. Then, they came to INEC and our men repelled them too.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we recorded about 95 percent success. There were no casualties on the part of the police contrary to some media reports that scores of policemen were killed.\n\n\u201cSince last night, we have been moving from hospital to hospital because we are sure some of the attackers escaped with serious wounds and we are appealing to the management of various hospitals to help us track them. Eight riffles, consisting of AK 47 and pump action, as well as live ammunition and items of clothing and berets were recovered from the attackers. \u201d\n\nWhile assuring the people of the state of safety, Owolabi urged them to be law abiding as they go about their normal businesses and to keep security agencies abreast of development around their areas. \u201cWe\u2019re working with all the armed forces: army, navy, civil defence, DSS and others including joint patrol. We\u2019re back in the street reclaiming the public space.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the INEC Resident Electoral Commission, Dr. Nkwachukwu Orji disclosed that six of the office vehicles, collation centre and part of its store were affected in the incident.\n\n\u201cThe damage is not substantial because the police were able to contain them. The areas affected were the open space we use for our collation centre and part of our store. About six of our vehicles were affected. But we\u2019re still accessing the level of damages\u201d.\n\nAsked if the incident would affect the November 6 Anambra governorship election, the INEC chief simply replied: \u201cconducting election is for the commission to decide\u201d.\n\nSuspected arsonists torch INEC office in Imo\n\nIn a another development, suspected band of arsonists weekend, attacked the Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s, INEC, office at Ahiazu Mbaise local government area of Imo State.\n\nConfirming the incident in a telephone chat yesterday, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Professor Emeka Ezeonu, said that the incident was a clear case of attempted arson.\n\nHis words: \u201cA spirited attempt was made weekend to burn the INEC office at Ahiazu Mbaise local government area of Imo State. I cannot explain why hoodlums are now targeting INEC offices.\n\n\u201cOn getting wind of the ugly development, I sent a high powered delegation to go and assess the extent of the damage done to the facility. The report they sent in showed that it was a clear case of attempted arson, presumably in the early hours of Sunday, May 23, 2021. \u201cThe hoodlums destroyed the external burglary proof and it appeared that when they realized that they still had to contend with another burglary proof inside the office, they opted to try their luck through the roof.\n\n\u201cThey opened the roof and sent in their inflammable substance and lit it. Part of the Conference Room was burnt, window protectors were destroyed and Almaco windows smashed. However, by sheer divine intervention, the early morning heavy rainstorm, effectively put out the fire.\u201d\n\nWhile confirming that the matter has been reported to the Divisional Police Headquarters in the local council area, the Resident Electoral Commissioner wondered why people are not speaking against the growing damages of public establishments in the South East.\n\nEbonyi Police arrest mastermind of attacks on Police Divisions\n\nAccording to the Police, items such as firearms and ammunition including one Double Barrel English gun, with eleven live cartridges; one locally made single gun; one Riot Police smoke gunner stolen from Ohaozara Police Divisional Headquarters; three Police Bartons; one hand grenade, one canister of teargas, and two Police belts were recovered.\n\nOther items included: two Police radio communication handsets with chargers; all stolen from Onicha Divisional Headquarters which was also attacked and set ablaze on 4th Feb. 2021; four Biafra flags and one juju box.\n\nIn a statement by the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, PPRO, DSP Loveth Odah: \u201cOn the 20/05/2021, at about 1700hrs following the intelligence report of movement of arms and ammunition and the report of armed robbers terrorizing Isu, Onicha LGA, one Eluu Ekpehu Emmanuel was arrested who made useful statement to the Police and led Police operatives to the house of their gang leader popularly known as \u201cBlood\u201d;\n\n\u201cThere were his cohorts who are alleged to have been terrorizing the area and the master minders of the various attacks on three Police Divisional Headquarters in the area, namely Onicha, Abaomege and Ohaozara.\n\n\u201cBlood and his cohorts on sighting the Police, opened fire on the operatives who gallantly fought back. In the process, Blood was apprehended with gunshot injuries while others escaped into the nearby bush with bullet wounds. Blood\u2019s house and premises were immediately searched and items were recovered.\n\n\u201cThe wounded suspect was immediately rushed to AE-Federal Teaching Hospital (AE-FETHA) Abakaliki for medical treatment where he later gave up the ghost. The corpse was deposited at the same hospital mortuary for preservation. The gang is responsible for the attacks on government facilities and the killing of security agents in the state.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Anayo Okoli, Regional Editor, South-East, Dapo Akinrefon, Festus Ahon, Johnbosco Agbakwuru, Davies Iheamnachor & Olayinka Ajayi\n\nThe Presidency yesterday questioned the propriety of the ban placed on open grazing in Southern Nigeria by governors of the region.\n\nThe 17 Southern governors, under the aegis of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, had in what is now described as Asaba Declaration, raised 12 resolutions, one of which was the ban on open grazing.\n\nBut reacting to the ban yesterday, the Presidency in a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, also promised that rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country will commence in June.\n\nHowever, the Presidency\u2019s statement drew the ire of the Yoruba socio-political organisatuion, Afenifere, its Igbo counterpart, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, as well as the Pan-Niger Delta Forum PANDEF.\n\nShehu said President Muhammadu Buhari had expressed a strong resolve to address the conflicts between herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari has approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture, in a report the President signed in April.\n\nHe said the recommendations were made \u201cbefore the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempted to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\n\u2018Asaba declaration no solution\u2019\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIt is very clear that there was no solution offered from their resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in our country for generations.\n\n\u201cBut the citizens of the Southern states \u2014 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2014 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) \u2014 regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen, in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families, including schooling \u2014 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes, allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both federal and states. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked.\n\n\u201cActual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, unpresidential \u2014Afeni Fete\n\nReacting to the Presidency\u2019s remarks on the ban on open grazing yesterday, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, described the statement as unfortunate and un-presidential.\n\nAfenifere\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cThe reaction of the Presidency is not only unfortunate to say the least, it is also un-presidential.\n\n\u201cThe reason for saying this is simple, as the statement betrays a lack of understanding of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which the Presidency is supposed to be guided by.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution describes a governor as the Chief Security Officer of his or her state. Not only that, this same constitution vests the control of the land in the states in the governors of the respective states.\n\n\u201cIf this is the case, how would the pronouncement by these governors on the steps they intend to take to ensure security in their respective states be deemed to be \u2018legally questionable?\u2019\n\n\u201cMr. Garba Shehu also talked about rehabilitating \u2018grazing reserves\u2019. Is it the Federal Government-initiated grazing reserves that most states have rejected? It is a big pity that a man of Mr. Shehu\u2019s professional standing, who was not only an editor but also a former President, Nigerian Guild of Editors, could come out with this type of statement trying to pull wool on our collective eyes.\n\n\u201cTo us in Afenifere, everything about agriculture, like many other sectors, belongs to the states and local governments. The Federal Government has no control over it and should not dabble into what it has no constitutional power over.\n\n\u201cIt is in order to let each tier of government fully understand its bounds that makes us to keep insisting that we should quickly restructure and go back a Regional Constitution. \u201cWhat Garba Shehu is saying should hold no water. We stand by the position of the Southern governors, which incidentally, is what their counterparts in other parts of the country are embracing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s insult to Southerners\u2014 Ohanaeze\n\nIn its reaction, Ohanaeze Ndigbo in a statement by its spokesman, Chidozie Alex Ogbonnia, stated: \u201cIt is highly inconceivable that a group of people, herders in Nigeria, would prefer open grazing to the global practice of cattle ranching.\n\n\u201cOpen grazing exposes the herders to the risks of the wild forests, denies herders\u2019 children the basic education and retards their intellectual growth.\n\n\u201cAbove all, the major cause of conflicts between the Fulani and other ethnic groups is the herders-farmers clashes.\n\n\u201cThe clashes have assumed an intolerable dimension. Only today, over one hundred indigenes of Benue State were alleged to have been killed by herders. It has been like this on a daily basis.\n\nHow can Nigeria survive with this trend?\n\n\u201cIt is in the interest of the corporate existence and peace in Nigeria that open grazing is abolished. Any attack on the resolution on open grazing by the Southern governors is an insult to the sensibilities of the whole Southerners.\u201d\n\nIrrational comments \u2014 PANDEF\n\nReacting in a similar manner, the Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, lambasted the spokesman of President, Garba Shehu,over the comment.\n\nPANDEF described the comment by Shehu as irrational, adding that the decision of the governors was in consonance with the people of the South.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, noted in Port Harcourt that the comment by Shehu was the height of irrationality.\n\nRobinson said: \u201cOur position is clear. When the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, in his comment, condemned the position of the governors of the South on open grazing, we clearly said such position was clearly inconsistent and irrational.\n\n\u201cFor the spokesman of the President to come up and say that decisions taken by democratically-elected officials of 17 states of the country, should be discountenanced is the height of irresponsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is idiotic and deserves all the negatives that we can find to qualify it. And this attitude of Garba Shehu, has shown obviously that he is not the spokesman of the President. Garba Shehu is now the spokesman of the Fulani ethnic nationality. That is what he has reduced himself to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that Mr. President will still allow Garba Shehu to be in the Presidency. The decision of the governors of the South is a settled matter. The people of Southern Nigeria are in full support of what the governors have done.\n\n\u201cThe governors only gave voice to the position of the people. They were elected by the people, so they will always stand by the people.\n\n\u201cWhat they did was to give voice to what their people wanted them to say. We are solidly behind them. If anybody should be discountenanced, it is the likes of Shehu and their bias.\n\n\u201cThey think that they own this country. Nobody owns this country. We stand by the governors and we encourage them to go ahead and implement the ban on open grazing. Open grazing is outdated, it is archaic and has no place in a modern society like ours.\u201d\n\nFG stylishly stoking insecurity \u2014 Okowa\n\nAlso reacting last night, the Chairman of South-South Governors Forum, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, said: \u201cThat the Federal Government is opposed to the ban on open grazing does not mean the governors cannot go ahead to do what they want to do.\n\n\u201cRemember it was the same way the Federal Government was opposed to Amotekun when the South-West governors came up with it. And when they saw the futility of the attempt to muscle those governors to stop it, they retreated.\n\n\u201cThis is about governance; it means the Federal Government is stylishly telling Nigerians that they are the ones stoking the fire of insecurity. If the governors of the Southern states have said one way to secure the country, is to go the way of ranching and stop open grazing, it should be embraced.\n\n\u201cThey came together as patriotic Nigerians. By the way, Southern Governors Forum is a mixed group; there is APC, there is PDP, there is APGA, so it is not partisanship and I am surprised that the Federal Government is looking at it like that.\n\n\u201cWhat they said was that every state should go and implement it. It means that the states should go and make laws and it is within the rights of the states to make laws to govern their environment.\n\n\u201cThe law is already existing in some states. Ekiti already has it under Fayose before he left office; Benue already has it and one or two other states. It is for good governance of the place. If the Federal Government is saying governors don\u2019t have right, then it is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWhat is government all about? Government is about protecting lives and properties; that\u2019s fundamental \u2014 the welfare of people. And one fundamental thing about giving your people welfare is to protect their lives and properties.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government is saying what the governors are trying to do to ensure that lives and properties is wrong, then is unfortunate.\n\nI don\u2019t want to believe that that the Federal Government can come and say that. That your children are saying this is the way we think we should do things to help us and the father is somewhere saying it\u2019s not right; is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWhat are the Governors saying? They are saying that this thing about open grazing is causing so much strife between herders and communities.\n\nYou are grazing and you are destroying farms.\n\n\u201cYou have gone from destroying farms to attacking human beings, raping women, killing, kidnapping and all of that! Not just destroying crops which is one way of making us not to have enough food; you have now gone beyond destruction of farm lands and crops to attack on human beings.\u201d\n\nSouthern govs\u2019 position mere declaration of intent \u2014 Sagay\n\nThe Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, PACAC, Professor Itse Sagay, SAN, has tasked the Southern governors to solidify resolution on open grazing by asking each state Assembly in the South to apply the Benue State approach passing a law banning open grazing in their individual state.\n\nFielding questions in a monitored programme yesterday on Channels Television, \u2018Politics Today\u2019 Sagay maintained that mere declaration won\u2019t be as impactful as a law from each Southern state prohibiting open grazing.\n\n\u201cI have been advocating ranching for cattle herding since 2011 as the only way-out. I was the first to talk about it until it became an existential threat to many communities particularly in the South.\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t think a declaration is sufficient, governors have to go back to their individual houses of assemblies and introduce motions , the way Benue state did and actually pass a law on banning open grazing and instituting ranching.\n\n\u201cSo a proclamation is not enough unless they already have laws which give powers to each governor which I don\u2019t think is the case. There is a need for each state assembly to actually pass a law against open grazing.\n\nThis is for me legally a declaration of intent but it should be followed up by legislation in the individual state of assembly of the Southern states. They have to pass laws prohibiting open grazing\u201d Sagay stated.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nThe Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy has called for the establishment of an independent regulator for effective operations of the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST).\n\nDr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communication and Digital Economy made the call at a one-day public hearing in Abuja on Monday.\n\nThe public hearing was organised by the Senate Committee on Communications was on two bills- the Nigerian Postal Service amendment bill and Nationwide Toll-free emergency number establishment Bill, 2021.\n\nPantami said that a situation where the regulator was also involved in the provision of postal service would not make for effective operations of NIPOST.\n\n\u201cA regulator is not supposed to be the operator, because if a regulator is a player in the same market it may be a compromise based on personal interest.\n\n\u201cIt may not allow for effective regulation of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe regulator is to be an independent body and not an operator,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Joint Tax Board (JTB) while making its presentation, faulted some proposed provisions of the amendment bill that empowered public postal operators to collect stamp duty on electronic transactions.\n\nThe JTB secretary, Mrs Nana-Aisha Obomeghie, said the draft bill, was contrary to constitutional provisions and extant laws.\n\nShe said the bill replicated provisions of collection of stamp duties as contained in the Stamp Duties Act (SDA).\n\n\u201cThe board also observed that the bill, as currently drafted, encroached on the role and duties of State Revenue Authorities regarding denoted stamps, provided for wide and poorly articulated sections on electronic transactions and will usher in confusion and non-clarity concerning the collection of stamp duties if passed.\n\n\u201cSection 4(2) of the stamp duties act as amended states that the relevant tax authority in the state shall collect duties in respect of instruments executed between persons or individuals at such rates to be imposed or charged as may be agreed with the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that there is a misrepresentation that the proposed Nigerian Postal Commission is mandated to administer the collection of stamp duties and to deal with all issues concerning stamping protocol to the exclusion of state revenue authorities, this is misleading,\u201d Obomeghie said.\n\nShe, therefore, advised that certain provisions of the bill be reworked to ensure clarity on stamp duties collection, production of stamps, and electronic payment for stamps.\n\n\u201cA refinement of the bill will also ensure alignment with the provisions of the Constitution in respect of States\u2019 mandate to collect stamp duties for transactions between individuals,\u201d she added.\n\nSen. Oluremi Tinubu (APC-Lagos), Chairman of the Committee, said the global postal industry and indeed, every facet of human life has continued to evolve, thus requiring the Nigerian Postal Industry to rise to the demands of existing realities.\n\nShe said there was the need to ensure that legislation for the sector was reflective of the existing realities.\n\n\u201cConsequently, this bill proposes an expansion of the current objectives of NIPOST, to cover implementation of a national postal policy, encouraging local and foreign investment in the postal industry.\n\n\u201cIt also seeks for protection of rights and interests of service providers in the sector, provision of postal services to areas and towns that were erstwhile, not sustainable, promoting small and medium enterprises in the sector, and engender innovation, integration, and inclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said the bill also provided for the unbundling of NIPOST by splitting the roles of the Nigerian Postal Service also referred to as the Public Postal Operator (PPO), whose responsibility shall be the provision of universal postal services in Nigeria.\n\nTinubu said the bill also made provision for administration and planning of a National Postcode System, for efficient mail delivery, and sought to establish a Universal Postal Service Fund (UPSF) for the deployment of subsidised postal services and infrastructure to the unserved and underserved areas.\n\nOn the bill for the establishment of a nationwide toll-free emergency number, she said the bill provided for the establishment of a nationwide primary emergency telephone number for reporting of emergencies to the relevant agencies of government.\n\nShe said the bill sought to empower the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) with the responsibility of supervising, managing, and implementing the provision of the contents of the bill.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The future of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is in the balance as the House of Representatives considers a bill to scrap the scheme.\n\nThe scheme will be 50 years old in 2023, but it may not get to celebrate the 50th anniversary, if the bill becomes law.\n\nAwaji Abiante, a lawmaker from Rivers State on Wednesday sponsored a bill to repeal the act establishing the scheme and to also amend the 1999 constitution accordingly.\n\nThe lawmaker seeks to use the bill to amend section 315 (1)(a) of the 1999 constitution.\n\nIt would be recalled that the scheme was established after the civil war in 1973.\n\nCorruption ravaged posting\n\nNYSC posting has been plagued by corruption lately. With the state of insecurity in the country, graduates and parents now procure posting in a bid to avoid volatile states, DAILY POST investigation reveals.\n\nSeveral ex-corps, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, stated that with N70,000, you can get posted to the two most sought after states; Lagos and FCT.\n\nThe investigation further reveals that redeployment after camp is like N50,000. Most graduates avoid the Northern part of the country due to banditry.\n\n\u201cMy parents will not even allow me to go anywhere other than Abuja. We had to work it here. Normally, the fact that I schooled in Abuja, I am not supposed to get posted to Abuja, it is not even supposed to be in the options of preferred states, but here we are,\u201d a Corps member at the Kubwa camp told DAILY POST.\n\nOn if the government should scrap the scheme, he said, \u201cthere is a pride in wearing this cloth, my father wore it, and I am proud of wearing it too.\u201d\n\nHowever, some who cannot afford the money to bribe, are left with the options of risk accepting the posting or not participating in the scheme.\n\nSpeaking with a mother of a corps member posted to Katsina, Funke Alake in Ilorin Kwara state, expressed fear over the posting.\n\n\u201cAnytime we tune a radio to news, the only thing we hear about on the radio concerning the north is kidnapping, killing, and others. If they cannot protect these children, they should scrap it for god sake.\u201d\n\nA student of the University of Abuja, Ahmed Amidat, who also spoke on the bill, urged the lawmakers to reject the bill, and instead reform the system.\n\n\u201cNYSC offers you immediate employment opportunity with a stipend above the National minimum wage. You get to have job experience. Of course, I will not want to be posted to Maiduguri or Zamfara, but we can have a situation where you are allowed to serve in your state. That will be great.\u201d\n\nA civil servant, who works at the NYSC office but preferred not to be named said ending the NYSC will mean job loss for NYSC staff.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to the workers? Is he going to move them to other Ministries or what? These are questions they need to ask. Yes, the system is not perfect, yes we need to ensure the safety of the corps. But scrapping it is not the solution,\u201d the civil servant told DAILY POST.\n\nPeople who do business at the NYSC camp in Kubwa also opposed the bill.\n\nMr Abiante in the synopsis of the bill argued that the NYSC should be scrapped due to security, exploitation of corps members and failure of the scheme to bring about unity.\n\n\u201cAfter several decades, the program has failed to address the essence of its establishment,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nThe bill still has a long way to go, but the uncertainty of the scheme remains an issue.",

          "text": "Palpable fear has gripped residents of of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja over the deteriorating security situation in the area, particularly the satellite towns.\n\nDAILY POST had reported a looming security crisis in the city following activities of criminal elements disturbing the peace of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nLike the current state of insecurity in many parts of the country, there have been several occurrences of attacks on communities in the FCT, leading to killing and abduction of residents.\n\nAbuja which was hitherto known for its calmness and peace has relatively joined other states facing security challenges ranging from banditry to herdsmen attack and kidnapping.\n\nRecall that there have been series of reports on imminent attacks in the FCT particularly the planned invasion of the city by Boko Haram insurgents which recently stimulated tension among residents.\n\nThe Acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, a few days ago, raised the alarm that members of Boko Haram terrorists were planning to attack public formations in Abuja and the Plateau State capital, Jos.\n\nThe IGP noted that intelligence reports disclosed that the terrorists were being strategic on how to carry out the attack.\n\nHe placed the commissioners of police in both cities on red alert, to ensure the attacks are not carried out.\n\nAlthough such activities have not been witnessed in the city since the alarm was raised, other criminal elements have been on rampage in many parts of the territory.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that gunmen numbering about 20 on Sunday morning invaded the El-Rufa\u2019i Estate in Kuchiko Relocation Development Area, Bwari Area Council, Abuja shooting sporadically before whisking away a resident and his son.\n\nIt was gathered that the suspected kidnappers who were equipped with sophisticated weapons, overpowered the security guards before invading the home of the victims and picked them to an unknown destination.\n\nSources revealed that the gunmen\n\nalso attempted to abduct another household but with the timely arrival of soldiers from the Defence College, Bwari, the situation was salvaged after a gun duel with the assailants.\n\nOn Monday, some youths blocked vehicular movements at the Suleja axis of Niger State. They were on the popularly Abuja-Kaduna Expressway protesting against insecurity in their communities.\n\nSuleja is a neighbouring community to the FCT, usually less than 15 minutes drive.\n\nThe youths, mostly from villages adjoining the highway, were said to be protesting against incessant attacks by bandits and kidnappers on their communities.\n\nThey were said to have been angered by the early Monday fresh attack in the area during which at least 12 people were abducted n Gauraka town.\n\nIn the same vein, gunmen suspected to be bandits attacked the Kwakwashi community where one person was killed and 13 residents were kidnapped last week.\n\nThe Niger State Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Abiodun Wasiu who confirmed the incident, added that he could not ascertain the total number of persons abducted in the area.\n\n\u201cYes, there was an incident of such around that Kwankashe area in Madalla, where some victims were taken away, \u201d the PPRO said\n\nSimilarly, Otunla Blessing, who was said to be a recent graduate of the University of Abuja was found dead near the school premises a few days ago.\n\nThe deceased who was suspected to have been raped before being murdered was found naked in a gutter at Student village in Iddo Sarki, Abuja on Saturday, May 22, 2021.\n\nBlessing who travelled from Oyo to Abuja to receive her result before her untimely death, studied English Language at the university and graduated in 2020.\n\nSome of the residents of the FCT who spoke with DAILY POST correspondent expressed fear of further attacks.\n\nA Head Mistress of a popular primary school in Bwari, who identified herself simply as Mrs Umunna, told our correspondent that the proprietor of her school was considering shutting down the school over fear of abduction.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about insecurity in the Federal Capital Territory, the first place that runs through your mind is Bwari.\n\n\u201cThis is a satellite town where the criminals could hide for their dubious activities. We watch our steps here for the fear of the unknown.\u201d\n\nA civil servant who spoke from Gwagwalada, Mr Innocent Modupe said everyone in the area have been forced by the security situation to remain vigilant.\n\nHe said he has personally reviewed his daily activities to ensure he returns to his family before sunsets.\n\n\u201cThis is Abuja; where you are working may not be close to where you live and as it is now, if you are not with your family by 6 pm, there may be a problem because these criminals usually operate when it is dark.\n\n\u201cAbuja used to be peaceful but some evil persons have taken advantage of its calmness to hide and unleash terror on innocent residents who are struggling to make ends meet,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the department of political science, University of Abuja who preferred to remain anonymous, said despite the security in the school premises, some students prefer living with their parents, friends or relatives in the main town where they believe they can be safe.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWhen we heard of several abductions from higher institutions in Kaduna State, we lost our peace and sleep, thinking we would suffer same fate.\n\n\u201cThe Authority of the school has assured students of their safety but this is Nigeria, anything can happen anytime. I wish this issue of insecurity happening everywhere could just end now\u201d.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on plans to avert further attacks in the city, the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, ASP Mariam Yusuf told DAILY POST correspondent that the command has put up strategies to ensure that lives and property of the residents are protected.\n\n\u201cWe have deployed overt and covert strategies to ensure the protection of lives and property within the FCT,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "As Nigerians continue to mourn the shocking death of Lt. Gen Ibrahim Attahiru, the nation\u2019s Chief of Army Staff, there seems to be a growing concern over fears that the Nigeria Air Force Beachcraft 350i that crashed at the Kaduna International Airport, causing the death of the CAOS and 10 others was actually sabotaged.\n\nDAILY POST reported that the aircraft crashed at the Kaduna airport on Friday evening, killing everyone on board.\n\nThe crash was the third this year involving military planes, after another Beachcraft aircraft crashed at the Abuja airport in February this year and another Alpha jet, involved in the fight against insurgency in the North-East, was declared crashed.\n\nOf all the crashes, Friday\u2019s seem to be more shocking, leading to curious questions on the initial reason given for the unfortunate incident.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Defence Headquarters in a statement on Friday night declared that the crash of the aircraft carrying the COAS and others was caused by bad weather.\n\nThe statement signed by Brig.Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, Acting Director Defence Information, read in part: \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) regrets to announce that this evening at about 1800 Hours, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru in company of his entourage, who were on official trip from Abuja to Kaduna, were involved in an air mishap.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate incident occurred after landing at the Kaduna International Airport due to inclement weather.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor has, therefore, directed that an Accident Investigation Board be constituted to unravel the immediate and remote cause(s) of the unfortunate accident.\n\n\u201cAs we pray for the repose of the souls of our gallant and committed Chief of Army Staff and other personnel on board with him, the AFN solicits the support and understanding of all Nigerians in the face of this tragic incident.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that the Armed Forces of Nigeria remains resolute in combating the security challenges bedeviling our nation. The sacrifices of our dearly departed heroes will not be in vain.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Defence Headquarters, though in one breath seemed to have been conclusive about the cause of the crash, yet gave the DHQ out as not knowing what actually happened, as it said the Chief of Defence Staff, General Leo Irabor has ordered the constitution of an Accident Investigation Board to prove the immediate and remote cause(s) of the crash.\n\nFor many, who are still in shock over the crash and the manner in which it happened, bad or inclement weather, as the DHQ, puts it may not be enough to have the aircraft burn the way it did.\n\nThe aircraft, as reported by many media outlets, quoting residents of the Kaduna Airport quarters and its environs, was already burning before it hit the ground. This has led to many suspecting some foul play.\n\nThe factional Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, in a statement on Saturday while reacting to the crash and the death of the COAS and others, called for a thorough investigation into the crash, saying it suspects foul play.\n\nThe group, which asked President Muhammadu Buhari and his deputy, Yemi Osinbajo and other notable Nigerians to avoid flying private jet until the outcome of a thorough investigation into the crash, said the Friday crash was \u2018suspicious\u2019 and had signs of a \u2018possible Sabotage\u2019.\n\nThe statement issued by its Secretary General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, read in part: \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide consoles with President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerian Army over the demise of Lt- General Ibrahim Attahiru and ten others in the air force plane crash in Kaduna on Friday 21/5/21. This is perceived as a result of sabotage that should be investigated and the late Army chief with others had paid the Supreme prices for peace to return to Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze queries if the era of plane crashes as phenomenal occurrences for supreme prizes for patriotic Nigerians had returned?\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari, V.P Osibanjo and others should avoid flying Private Jets until the investigations of the NAF ill fated flight that crashed at kaduna are concluded and made open to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nSeveral other Nigerians, harbouring similar suspicions have also expressed their doubts about the cause of the crash, insisting on thorough investigation to ascertain the truth.\n\n@MrKlassiq, writing on Twitter wondered how an aircraft carrying the COAS will just crash like that. \u201cWhy will an aircraft carrying the chief of army staff of a country like Nigeria crash in this trying security time? We need answers please. It should be investigated \u2026.\u201d\n\nFor @ISellLands, Attahiru\u2019s death is a clear case of set up. \u201cAttahiru is a good Man & I strongly believe his death is a Set Up. Why will a VIP plane Crash? We all watched Hollywood movies & it\u2019s like, we all know how good people got treated by biased government personnel. We ain\u2019t daft in this.His death needs a proper investigation\u201d while @Ahmad Jibrin, said the way the COAS died is the reason he cannot take up government appointment.\n\n\u201cI pray that the Almighty Allah forgive his shortcomings, I\u2019m afraid to take any position in this country. It\u2019s not possible for a person who stands by truth\u201d, he wrote.\n\nA Lagos based security expert, who works with one of the multinationals in the country but does not want his name mentioned because of the sensitivity of the subject, believes that there was a foul play involved in Friday\u2019s crash.\n\nAccording to him, it is impossible for bad or inclement weather to cause a crash and have the aircraft burn the way it did.\n\n\u201cThere is something fishy in the entire incident; something is not just right with what has happened with Lt. Ibrahim Atahiru. I am not convinced that bad weather could have caused the crash, neither can I be convinced that there is no foul play at work.\n\n\u201cI do not want to join the military authorities to sell the story of bad weather; in fact their conclusion and provision of the cause of the crash was rather hasty and suspicious. I never expected that the Defence Headquarters will be that naive and amateurish in talking about the cause of the crash, the same night it occured, without even a simple preliminary investigation. It would have been enough to inform Nigerians that an investigation has been ordered which is expected anyway.\n\n\u201cWhile I may not readily buy in to some of the conspiracy theories flying about, I am inclined towards a full scale independent investigation into the crash. An investigation that should ideally involve accident investigators from outside the country so as to assure Nigerians that nothing will be hidden. This is needed, not just because of the ordinary people on the streets, who are very curious at the moment, but for our armed forces. Our soldiers must be assured that nothing fishy happened and that even as they daily risk their lives in the defence of the country, they are not exposed to sabotage.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Government must take concrete steps toward confidence building in the armed forces and that can only start with unravelling the real cause of that crash. Too many have happened and nothing is been done to allay fears. The young female pilot, Arotile, was suspected to have been taken out, but not much was done by government to dispel the rumour. Two other Nigerian Air Force aircrafts have also crashed before Friday\u2019s own; what has been done in the way of investigation? What the government should understand is that when air mishaps are investigated and reports released, it is not just to apportion blames, but also to ensure that similar situations are avoided in future. It helps to enhance safety standards and procedures. So, things have to be done differently this time around,\u201d.the security expert said.",

We are happy with the relative peace in Bayelsa and would like to maintain and sustain it.\n\n\u201cThere are other avenues to explore. We have the local government chairman there. If all avenues fail, protest should come as the last resort. Let us not wake up every minute to protest. I, however, applaud your peaceful disposition with the Nigerian Agip Oil Company over the years.\u201d\n\nDescribing Twon-Brass, host to Agip and Shell, as important and strategic to the state and Nigeria in general, Diri stated that all avenues would be explored to resolve the contentious issues and prevent a breakdown of law and order.\n\nDiri further disclosed that to forestall conflicts in communities arising from Global Memoranda of Understanding (GMoUs), government had made it compulsory that it would be part of the signing of GMoUs with companies.\n\n\u201cNo GMoU should be kept secret because we have seen that as a point of conflict between communities and companies operating in the state.\u201d",

It is very difficult to identify which of the rivers is actually flowing into the other. That is, at our various border communities, there is no actual way of separating the peoples living in the two states of Lagos and Ogun.\n\n\u201cWhichever way we look at it, Ogun State has a larger percentage of the population over-spill into Lagos State as witnessed in many of our border communities in Ota/Ilete; Akute Alagboole; Lambe; Ojodu; Agbado; Mowe; Warewa; Isheri and, indeed, all the eight local government areas that share boundaries with Lagos State.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Okays ranching, revival of grazing reserves\u2019 take-off in June\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday took issue with Southern governors over their ban on open cattle grazing in the region.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his media assistant, Mallam Garba Shehu, described the ban, announced as one of the resolutions the 17 governors from the zone made during their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, as of questionable legality.\n\nAccording to him, the governors\u2019 action is of \u201cquestionable legality, given the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT)-regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nBuhari, hoever, approved ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nThe president\u2019s stance on the Southern governors\u2019 Asaba Declaration came a few days after the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), expressed similar views.\n\nMalami, while fielding questions on a live television programme, had kicked against the open grazing ban, saying it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe AGF had compared the Southern governors\u2019 decision to their Northern counterparts banning spare parts trading in the North, considering the fact that the majority of spare parts traders in the North are from the South.\n\nHe had said: \u201cIt is about constitutionality. Within the context of the freedoms enshrined in our constitution, can you deny a right of a Nigerian? It is as good as saying maybe the Northern governors coming together to say that they prohibit spare parts trading in the North. Does it hold water? Does it hold water for a Northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the North?\u201d\n\nHowever, Malami came under fire over his criticism, with the Southern governors daring him to challenge their decision in the court.\n\nChairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, had described Malami\u2019s opposition to the ban on open cattle grazing as \u201cwicked and arrogant.\u201d\n\nSome senior lawyers and the Founder of Stanbic IBTC and Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, also criticised the minister for his comments.\n\nWhile the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and the spokesman of the Senate had called on Buhari to remove the minister for opposing the ban, the South-east Governors\u2019 Forum had said those who opposed the ban wanted the killings to continue.\n\nBut Buhari, while rejecting the governors\u2019 ban, expressed the determination of his administration to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe statement from the presidency said Buhari had approved some measures to permanently end the frequent skirmishes between farmers and herders as recommended by the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono.\n\nThe statement added that Nanono had submitted a report detailing the recommendations to the president, who endorsed it in April, \u201cwell before the actions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\nThe president said the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions didn\u2019t offer any solution to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in the country for generations.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut the citizens of the Southern states\u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria\u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFortunately, this declaration has been pre-empted, for whatever it is intended to achieve, and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizens in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\nIt added that despite the COVID-19 pandemic that took a toll on public finances, the federal funding for the forest reserve project is ready and will take off in interested states by June.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both federal and states. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualisation of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "OPS Excited over Manufacturing Sector\u2019s Recovery from COVID-19 Headwinds",
          "text": "By Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) have expressed excitement over the rebound of the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2021, which recorded a growth rate that was higher than its pre-COVID-19 performance.\n\nData released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday showed that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020.\n\nThe data also showed that the manufacturing sector recorded a 3.40 per cent growth rate in Q1 2021 after recording negative growth in the Q4 of 2020.\n\nIn addition, its Q1 2021 performance was also higher than the 0.81 per cent and 0.43 per cent it recorded in Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 respectively, which were pre-COVID-19 era.\n\nMAN Director-General, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, while reacting to the GDP report said yesterday that the reported 3.40 per cent growth rate of the manufacturing sector in Q1 2021 came as a surprise, giving the numerous challenges facing the sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are currently experiencing the rising cost of manufacturing inputs, so it is surprising to see a rate higher than the rate of 0.81per cent in Q1 2019 and 0.43 per cent of Q1 2020, which were relatively stable periods.\n\n\u201cIn Q1 2021, manufacturing activities more or less rebounded to the level of pre-COVID-19 period. So, it is expected that the sector will present a better performance in Q1 2021 than what obtained in Q4 2020. Particularly the food, beverage, and tobacco and the chemical and pharmaceutical sub-sectors are expected to post higher growths due to the relatively higher capacities utilisation they enjoyed since 2020.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is not out of place for the cement and basic metal, iron, and steel sector to present high growths in Q1 2021 due to the increased level of construction work going on in different parts of the country backed by government spending across the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the NBS\u2019s Q1 2021 report on the manufacturing sector corroborated MAN\u2019s Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) of Q1 2021. The MCCI is a quarterly survey of the manufacturing sector. Its index showed improvement in the confidence of manufacturers in a good number of manufacturing sectoral groups.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the \u201cgovernment to intensify its intervention initiatives and follow through on the cost reduction aspect of ease of doing business. There is urgent need to create a friendlier operating environment and deliberately support the productive sector in a strategic manner.\u201d\n\nLCCI Director-General, Dr. Muda Yusuf, also stated that the recovery of the manufacturing sector from a negative growth territory in Q4 2020 to a positive growth level of 3.4 per cent in Q1 2021 was a surprise.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cThe sector has been grappling with an unprecedented foreign exchange illiquidity crisis over the past few months. This is coupled with the structural, policy, institutional and macroeconomic challenges that have bedeviled the sector. The data does not reflect the reality of the experiences of most manufacturers.\u201d\n\nBut the Chief Consultant of the B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, said during the breakfast meeting of the Nigeria-South Africa Chamber of Commerce held last Thursday that the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was recovering contrary to the sentiments that the manufacturing entities are closing down.\n\nAccording to him, there are enough activities along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Ogun State corridor where new factories are sprouting up to confirm the survey outcomes of the NBS.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese things are real. I can tell you here on authority that there are many conversations with foreign investors trying to put money into manufacturing in Nigeria as we speak. These are real foreign investors. I will not want us to go with the sentiment that nothing is happening there.

Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June\u201d, the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "title": "Successful product managers are walking encyclopedias.",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

          "title": "New FirstBank Website Puts YOU, the customer, First!",
          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be. Knowing that some potential customers do not live by its operating hours, FirstBank offers banking on their terms through the website.\n\nA standout feature of the new website is that it enables online applications and the ability to submit personal information securely. That makes it easy for interested visitors to open an account, offering a clear start to their banking journey.\n\nTools and Content that Empower Customers\n\nEvery user experience begins with a goal in mind and the new FirstBank website empowers its customers by providing a wide array of financial information and tools that meet customers needs, whatever they are. Among many actions, users can perform various transactions \u2013 make payments, transfer money, manage accounts, buy airtime, calculate loan rates and virtually interact with the bank \u2013 without stepping out of their comfort zone.\n\nThe site also serves as a library to keep customers abreast of various financial services solutions and offers intriguing content that is relevant to FirstBank\u2019s varied customer base \u2013 such as how-to guides that educate consumers on better managing their money and making the best financial decisions, thereby helping them to improve their economic and social wellbeing, as well as unique blog articles/insights on enterprise scaling, global trade and navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, targeted at corporate clients.\n\nLocation Finder\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the new FirstBank website is its Location Finder, where visitors can browse locations of the bank\u2019s branches and Firstmonie Agents. The feature allows users to search based on their radius or address and helps them find the FirstBank branch that\u2019s closest to them and best fits their needs. The branch locator is interactive and integrated with Google Maps API, which makes it easier for the visitor to browse the locations.\n\nOverall, FirstBank gets it right when it comes to usability, understanding its customers\u2019 needs and expectations, and website navigation behavior while creating a beautiful site that employs some of the latest trends in responsive web design, with exceptional user experience and a perfect mix of exciting features.\n\nWith the new FirstBank website, customers are at an edge in the industry as they establish a relationship with the Bank that puts YOU, its customers, First.\n\nYou can visit the new FirstBank website here.",

          "text": "14th May, 2021 \u2013 Lumos, Africa\u2019s leading solar home system provider in conjunction with Modion Communications, a fast-rising PR Agency in Africa, has won the Sabre Award for 2021 for its social PR campaign supporting indigent schoolgirl Fathia Dele Rasheed, from Ondo State, Southwest, Nigeria in February 2020. The African Sabre Award is the continent\u2019s biggest prize for superior achievement in Public Relations and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAs part of the campaign, Lumos Nigeria tracked Dele after a picture of her doing her homework at night with illumination from an ATM facility surfaced on social media. The company installed a free Solar Home System (SHS) in Dele\u2019s home within 48 hours after the social media reveal, enabling constant access to electricity for her and her family, using Lumos\u2019 SHS. The family joins over 100,000 household and small businesses in Nigeria already connected to Lumos.\n\nThe Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) intervention campaign tagged \u2018Touching Lives Through A Determined School Child \u2013 Dele Fathia\u2019 was adjudged as the overall best social campaign in Africa by the Sabre Awards jury, beating other top nominees from leading brands and companies in Kenya, Mauritius, and Uganda.\n\nCommenting on the recognition, the CEO of Lumos Nigeria, Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo, said; \u201cWhen we saw the desire and determination of Dele Fathia to learn even in the face of difficulties and limitation of power supply, we concluded that it was critical for us to take action by providing our easy-to-install solar home system, allowing her and the family to enjoy the endless possibilities that come with constant power supply,\u201d Mrs. Adebajo said.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see that the campaign has inspired renewed awareness on the adoption of solar power as an affordable alternative to the perennial power supply deficit in Nigeria. We are pleased that this solution has now gone mainstream, with Nigeria\u2019s government committed to providing 5 million Solar Home Systems to 25 million households as part of the country\u2019s quick-win strategy to deliver electricity to more families.\n\n\u201cWe believe everyone has the right to a better quality of life offered by access to clean, affordable and reliable power. Lumos remains committed to powering one home, one business, one community at a time. It is also pleasing to see that we have inspired other players in the ecosystem, who are now willing to provide similar initiatives to indigent families in communities where power supply from the grid is either inadequate or available,\u201d she added.\n\nAt the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Lumos, in collaboration with All-On, installed solar powered systems in isolation centres across the country as well as the installation of Solar home systems to over 147 primary health centers across Nigeria. This was in addition to installing its solar systems at Primary Health Centres across 20 Local Governments in Lagos State to help improve quality healthcare delivery to grassroots communities.\n\nABOUT LUMOS\n\nLumos is a market-leading provider of high-quality solar home systems in Africa, designed to make reliable and clean power accessible to everyone. We combine easy to use technology with personalised service to power prosperity for millions of people. For more information, visit www.lumos.com.ng.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

It allows easy retrieval of information like income, account statements, real-time balance, and historical transactions. It also attempts to improve financial inclusion and connectivity in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe API startup claims to have secured partnerships with over 16 financial institutions in Nigeria. And so far, it has reportedly connected over 100,000 financial accounts for its partners and analysed over 66 million financial transactions.\n\nThe money raised would be used to strengthen its current financial and identity data offerings, and launch new products for diverse business verticals.\n\nThe funds would also be used for its expansion into Kenya and Ghana. As reported by TechCrunch, Mono will be launched in Ghana in June 2021.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Abdul Hassan, said their expansion was inspired by their customers looking to expand to other markets. They work with their customers to give them the right tools to develop new experiences for their customers.\n\nData companies help businesses analyse acquired data and use them as required, and Abdul Hassan emphasised that Mono is focused on data and not open banking. Hence, Prakhar Singh, Mono Co-founder, expressed their intention to power the Internet economy with data unrelated to finances.\n\nThe CEO said that the fintech startup would ultimately diversify to become a data company. Therefore, it is taking things one product at a time.\n\nThough the startup envisions becoming a data company, connecting with payment gateways and other fintech management startups, Hassan thinks though it comes with a lot of issues, connecting to the systems is possible.\n\nTherefore, he believes that connecting to all available data and opening it up for businesses and developers is the first step to diversification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith its diversification plan, Mono would be powering the Internet economy and setting the mark for other API fintech startups in Africa.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s rising insecurity shows up in road transport data",
          "text": "After Nigeria lifted the lockdown on economic activities due to the coronavirus pandemic last year, the expected boom in road transport has not materialised as Nigerians are running scared of roads fast morphing into hunting grounds for kidnappers, new data show.\n\nDeclining road transport in an economy struggling with sluggish growth in a country with a poorly developed transport system has serious implications on trade and services.\n\nRising insecurity is showing up in local trade statistics as the sector contracted 2.43 percent in the first three months of 2021, making it the eighth consecutive quarterly contraction since the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThe quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates for the four quarters of 2020, the annual figure for 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows a decline of -23.75 percent in Road Transport GDP in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter.\n\nThe Federal Government began a phased opening of the lockdown measures from May 4 last year in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states, and proceeded more slowly in other parts of the country towards the end of the year.\n\nThe restriction on interstate travels outside curfew hours was lifted from July 1, 2020, and by the end of the year, any pretence of enforcement was all but gone. Yet, this has not translated into a boom.\n\nThe NBS data show a drop in road transport to -23.75 percent in the first quarter of 2021 from the previous quarter after all restrictions to road transport have been lifted.\n\nContrast this by a drop of -51.17 percent in the second quarter of 2020, when the government announced a ban on all travels in the country.\n\nRoad transport moderated slightly to -46.64 percent in the third quarter, then it rose to -1.37 percent and by the fourth quarter of 2020 only to enter abnormal territory, falling sharply to -23.75 percent.\n\nAnalysts attribute this dip to the impact of pervasive insecurity in the country marked by violent kidnappings, robberies and banditry across major highways.\n\n\u201cSecurity has a big role to play with this decline,\u201d notes Confidence Owamninaemi, a Lagos-based security analyst at SBM Intelligence, a geopolitical intelligence platform.\n\nSome of the most notorious routes in Nigeria include the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Kaduna-Abuja Expressway, Katsina/Ala \u2013 Wukari Road, linking Benue and Taraba states, Birnin Gwari-Kaduna Road; Kaduna-Saminaka-Jos Road, Enugu-Port Harcourt Road, among others.\n\nMoses Ojo, Lagos-based economic analysts, also points to pervasive insecurity in the country that culminated in the ENDSARS protests, which led to many buses leaving the road due to the burning and vandalising.\n\nAttacks on private and commercial buses in the night used to be a feature of road transport on notorious highways, but has since morphed into blood lust by criminal gangs who get a vehicle to stop by mowing down the driver with a hail of bullets. Then, they kidnap whoever is left alive helping to turn kidnapping into an industry.\n\nOn March 13, Muhammed Usman took a bus from Gusau, the capital city of Nigeria\u2019s north-west state of Zamfara, to see his family in Dangulbi, a small farming community about 50 kilometres away.\n\nHalf an hour into the trip, the bus came under heavy fire. An armed gang shot at the travellers from the front and rear end of the vehicle for several minutes. Usman grabbed a child who sat next to him and crouched down beneath the seat, covering him with his body.\n\nIn January, 30 people were killed and possibly 100 kidnapped in a single incident on the Kaduna-Zaria highway in Kaduna State. The perpetrators were dressed in military uniforms. Among the wounded was the Emir of Potiskum.\n\n\u201cTo travel by road in Nigeria is now an extreme sport,\u201d Owamninaemi says.\n\nThe NBS data further reveal that while road transport was falling, air transport, which has slowed since the pandemic, moderated by about 40 percent in the first quarter of 2021, while rail transport also saw a similar uptick.\n\nHowever, these modes of transport are not well suited to trade in a country that largely depends on its 195,000km of sketchy road network of which about 60,000km are paved. Their limited freight capacity still makes roads the most effective in facilitating trade.\n\nTravellers on these roads report higher fares as transport companies price security risk into the fare. For example, transport fare from Lagos to Benin City, which used to be around N3,500, has risen to over N7,500. Similar routes have also seen over 100 percent rise in fares.\n\nAnalysis by the Council of Foreign Relations notes that kidnapping for ransom, once largely confined to the Southern part of Nigeria, has now spread throughout the country.\n\n\u201cMilitant and criminal groups, including Boko Haram, resort to kidnapping for ransom to raise funds,\u201d the group states.",

And don\u2019t underestimate the possibility of being found out when carrying out sensitive duties.\u201d\n\nHe urged journalists to always get the highest standard of protective equipment.\n\nAccording to Fisayo, careful collaboration with trusted source is key in investigative journalism and urged participants to always create an exit strategy before embarking on sensitive assignments.\n\n\u201cNo big investigation can be done alone. You need fixers, information, perspectives that can only be possible when you interact with people. And they can make or mar you and your investigations. So, trust people in circumspect,\u201d Soyombo warned.\n\nHe cautioned journalists to always seek professional advise especially during pandemics so as to protect themselves , family and people around them.\n\nHe urged participants to read and write as often as possible and count the cost and be ready to pay the prize for the outcome of their investigation but however warned that no investigation was worth their lives.\n\nOther speakers at the training included Dr. Uzo Israel, Clinical Psychologist at the Department of Psychology, University of Lagos (UNILAG), who spoke on \u201cthe topic \u201cManaging Stress , Trauma And Other Psychological /Mental Health Challenges In The Coverage Of Pandemics And Crisis Situations\u201d , who said, both water and relaxation therapies were best tools for managing stress adding that they were cheap and without any side effects.\n\nDr. Israel, advised the participants to maintain healthy nutrition, relaxation , regular exercise (tailored to suit individuals) and sleep patterns especially when under pressure to meet deadlines; she added that trauma experienced during reporting has a tendency to overwhelm journalists\u2019 ability to cope with work and life.\n\nAccording to her, COVID-19 has challenged existing models of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which are by-products of past events, adding that research has shown that people now exhibit stress symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and urged participants to always have positive attitude about life.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Cutrupi Gillo, of IFEX, while speaking on the topic \u201cSafety Reporting Challenges Offline and Online\u201d, reminded journalists that security of their devices and optimal confidentiality is key to safe practice of the profession.\n\nMr. Gillo , a security expert, emphasized the need to ensure that devices as well as apps are locked while introducing new softwares that are safer for Information storage apart from the regular ones and urged participants to always conduct regular checklists and also secure their electronic mails for future purposes.\n\nHe warned journalists against visiting unknown and unverified websites that could compromise their devices and data.\n\nThe Executuve Director of International Press Centre (IPC), Mr. Lanre Ogundade while welcoming participants to the training, said that, the training was one of the components of a project on \u2018Enhanced Safety Awareness for Nigeria Journalists\u2019 being implemented by IPC with the support of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of organisations that promote and defend the right to freedom of expression and information.\n\nHe explained that IFEX also supports the building of appropriate capacities for journalists including safety in investigative reporting, digital security and management of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nMr. Arogundade highlighted that the training was expected to enhance the reporters capacity to manage difficult safety challenges while carrying out their assignments. He enjoined all participants to practice with increased confidence and manage dangerous situations effectively.\n\n\u201cThis workshop is expected to enhance capacity to manage difficult safety challenges while carrying out our work. Participating journalists are expected to be able to practice with increased confidence and manage dangerous situations .\n\n\u201cwhen the media is constantly attacked and intimidated, the society suffers information scarcity. Government, civil society, businesses, and individuals all loose when the media cannot do it\u2019s job of bringing reliable information to the public.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, the training became imperative because the importance of journalists\u2019 safety cannot be over emphasized, especially since journalists have to face the challenge of publicising information in a new and challenging but repressive environment, despite being poorly equipped and in some cases having limited knowledge and skills.\n\nThe over 50 participant were drawn from the print, broadcast, online journalists,and bloggers among whom were journalists assaulted or harassed in different ways in the course of covering the current Covid -19 pandemic in the southern States of Nigeria.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has chided governors of Southern states for banning open grazing of cattle by herders, describing it as \u201cattempted ban\u201d that has \u201cquestionable legality,\u201d and \u201cact politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\nRecall that governors of the 17 states of the South, had at a meeting in Asaba, Delta State, on Tuesday, May 11, announced a ban on opening grazing of cattle in the region, as a way of curbing attacks and criminality committed by suspected herders.\n\nThe move did not, however, go down well with the Buhari government. The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, last week, said the ban was unconstitutional and an infringement of the rights of herders.\n\nThe president in his response to the move in a statement by his spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu, on Monday, re-echoed Malami\u2019s arguments, noting that he has approved the rehabilitation of grazing reserves across the country as from June, to curb what he described as \u201cskirmishes\u201d between herders and farmers across the country.\n\nThe president, who questioned the legality of the recent ban on open grazing in the southern region of the nation, said his administration is working on other alternatives to bring peace between farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has expressed a strong resolve to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u2018killer herdsmen,'\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe President had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture in a report he submitted and the President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power.\u201d\n\nBuhari argued that the governors announced the ban without providing solutions, insisting that the herders had a right to freedom of movement.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that there was no solution offered from their resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in our country for generations,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.\u201d",

          "text": "*Spends over N2m on Diesel monthly, 2.2m on toners\n\nTom Okpe, Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives on Monday expressed dissatisfaction with the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) for spending N152.48 million on face masks, hand sanitizers, protective wears and hand gloves to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe Agency also spent at least N2.48 million on diesel on monthly basis for its head office in Utako, Abuja and office annex in Wuse 11, Abuja.\n\nIt also, spent the sum of N49.20 million on what it called vital contributors programme for hosting support of the online websites and functionalities in March, 2020, procured 8,000 litres of diesel for the Head Office in Abuja at N2.48 million while there was another supply of 8000 litres of diesel for its Office at Wuse 2, Abuja at the cost of N2.40 million.\n\nThis was revealed at the House Committee on Finance, uncovering these expenses at a hearing organised for some Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to determine remittances into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\nQuestions were raised by members of the Committee during the hearing on the expenditures, requesting explanation from the NHIS Executive Secretary, Mohammed Sambo who appeared before the panel.\n\nSambo in his response submitted that the Agency provided COVID-19 protection items under its Corporate Social Responsibility for some social workers on the frontline, including the Nigeria Police Force and Nigerian Security, Civil Defence Corps and Hospitals.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the huge expenditure to tunes of millions with respect to the COVID-19 items, we are National Health Insurance Scheme, we are supposed to be a strategic purchasing agency by mandate.\n\n\u201cDuring COVID-19 scourge, there was a plan of the Ministry of Health on sectoral response to Covid-19 and because we are dealing with healthcare facilities, we all know that at the beginning of COVID-19, most of the healthcare workers abandoned their duty post because they don\u2019t have items for their protection.\n\nAs part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, we identified first line organizations like police and others.\n\n\u201cAll the documents are available if the lawmakers need them. So this expenditure is not restrictive to NHIS. We have been directed to ensure the protection of our people.\n\n\u201cOn electricity, we all know last year, there has been a lot of erratic supply of electricity. We have a big office in Utako and in Wuse. In our office in Wuse, we had to maintain a cooling system.\n\n\u201cWe have huge infrastructure that requires cooling.\n\nAs we are improving our infrastructure now, we are talking about the level of electricity that are being consumed in future.\n\nAll the expenditure in respect to COVID, some of the MDAs wrote to PTF that they need these items , they wrote to us.\n\n\u201cIn respect to the toners, NHIS has a total of 38 state offices, 9 zonal offices as well as two offices at Abuja. So, when we are buying these items, we are not buying them as one toner per purchase. We buy them within the threshold to furnish the state and zonal offices.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary had earlier stated that monies generated from addition of extra dependants enrollee in 2019 was N33.81 million;\n\nN12.88 million in 2020 while N6.8 million has so far been generated in 2021, admitting that N47.35 million was generated in 2019;\n\nN45.5 million in 2020 and N11.49 million so far in 2021 from the accreditation and registration of Health Management Organizations, (HMOs).\n\nHe also said the agency has generated N1.61 million in 2019; N620,000 in 2020 and N700,000 so far in 2021 from the tenders paid by contractors.\n\n\u201cThe total revenue generation for 2019 was N32.14 million, for 2020 is N58.9 million and 2021, N18.5 million.\n\n\u201cWe remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of N20.5 million which represent 25 per cent for the total revenue for 2019, we have remitted N14.7 million which represents 25 per cent for 2020 and for 2021, remitting N4.46 million.\n\nWe have available, evidences of remittances encapsulated in this submission,\u201d he said.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the Committee, Saidu Abdullahi who stood in for the Chairman, James Faleke in his observation said the hearing was not to witch hunt any Agency but to shoot up the revenge generation of the country.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the Committee would not hesitate to invoke the relevant provisions of the law should any agency of government fail to appear before the Committee.\n\n\u201cWe have just started the revenue monitoring session for the year 2021. The objective is to ensure that we shore up the revenge generation of the country, as I stated that the country has the capacity to fund the budget size of 13 to 15 trillion.\n\n\u201cAll we need to do is to work together with the executive particularly the MDAs to ensure that we block all areas of leakages and ensure there are responsible, consolidated revenue fund.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to make noise or impress anybody by showing our faces on camera. We are taking it very serious.\n\nIt is in the spirit of measuring the performances of the agencies, in the spirit of ensuring that we mobilize more resources so that the executive would be able to fund the capital without necessarily looking at the angle of borrowing which has become the easiest way of managing our budget.\n\n\u201cSo, we expected to have Petroleum Equalization Fund, PTDF, Nigeria Oil Spillage and Detection response Agency and even the Export Processing Council. But only NHIS turned up. We would not take it lightly with any agency.\n\n\u201cIt is not a child\u2019s play. We are here to make this country work and we have to work in collaboration, we have to wok collectively for the good of our people.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman said a second chance will be given to agencies that failed yo turn up saying, \u201cwe will write again to them and if peradventure they decide not to turn up, we will have no other option than to refer back to the provisions of the constitution and do what is necessary for this country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe directed NHIS to furnish it with other relevant documents, such as its budget for the year 2021 from where it will be able to deduce whether or not the Scheme\u2019s personnel are paid from the Federation Account or through its ideal sources.",

          "text": "Success Nwogu\n\nA retired Deputy Director of the Department of Petroleum Resources, Engineer Sunday Adebayo Babalola, on Monday said the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery Company at $1.5 billion is a national disservice and a wasteful spending.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, despite public outcry, had in April, 2021 signed a contract with an international company, Maire Tecnimont SpA, for the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery Company, after the Federal Executive Council had approved the contract.\n\nSources said the project entailed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) activities for a full rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery complex, so as to restore the complex to a minimum of 90 per cent of its nameplate capacity.\n\nIt was learnt that the complex comprises two refineries of a total capacity of approximately 210,000 bpd (barrels per day).\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, said the project will be completed in three phases, the first within 18 months taking the refinery to 90 per cent production capacity, while the second carried out within 24 months and the final phase carried out within 44 months.\n\nNigeria has four refineries of a combined capacity of 445,000 barrels per day (bpd).\n\nOne of the refineries is in Kaduna State while three of the refineries are at Warri, Delta State and Port Harcourt, Rivers State; in the oil-rich Niger Delta region.\n\nThe Port Harcourt complex comprises two plants with a combined capacity of 210,000 bpd.\n\nBabalola, who is also a former Acting Managing Director of Belemaoil Nigeria Limited and currently, Director of All Grace Energy, in an interview said the idea of rehabilitating the refineries was wrong.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe idea of even going to repair or turn around those refineries is totally wrong because over the years, turn around maintenance had been done and they never achieved anything.\n\nWhy are you going to do the same thing that you have tried in the past and it never worked?\n\nYou can not tell me that your government is different from other government.\n\nThe people operating under the other government are the same. Politicians are the same.\n\nIt is the same people that were in the other party that have moved to the new party and so their mindsets have not changed.\n\n\u201cNow spending such money on those refineries may not come out well.\n\nThe money they are about to spend on those refineries can build new refineries very well, both modular and non modular, depending on the capacity they are planning for.\n\nWhy would you spend such money on a refinery that is almost forty years old? To achieve what at the end?\n\nIf I have the opportunity, those refineries should be sold out either directly or indirectly.\u201d\n\nHe also said government control of the generation of electricity in the country was responsible for the high electricity tariff.\n\nHe added that the price of premium motor spirit, popularly called petrol, should not be based on control.\n\nBabalola said, \u201cPeople will always cry out when there is price increment but it is the justification for the high price that is important.\n\nWhether we like or not, people are paying more for electricity than those companies are charging.\n\nWhen you buy diesel for your generator, you are paying for electricity.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs of the electricity is not based on what they are charging us.\n\nWhat about the time consumers do not put the electricity? The reality is that supply will dictate.\n\nIf they allow individuals to generate electricity and distribute them, you will see things will be better.\n\nAs long as government is in control of generation, we will still have the problem on how the tariff will be high.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOn the prices of petrol in Nigeria.\n\nSubsidy is not the answer.\n\nIt is not different from giving money to individuals.\n\nIn subsidy we found, round tripping, people who will claim they imported but they did not import and so many unholy things that were done.\n\nThe reality is that market forces should control the pricing of commodities if we want to move forward.\n\nThe economy that is market driven is more efficient and more effective than one that is driven by control.\n\nLets put subside aside, what of the oil pricing? It will go up and down with international crude oil pricing.\n\nThat is a give out. But it should not be based on control by individuals.\n\n\u201cHow can one say subsidy has been removed and the selling price is still being dictated, it won\u2019t work. When telecommunications company came to Nigeria, nobody controlled the prices.\n\nWhen they started it was N50 per minute but today you can make calls as low as N6 and N50 then is higher than N50 today because of the exchange rate.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nThe Lagos State House of Assembly on Monday read for a second time a bill that seeks to repeal the law which grants pension and other emoluments to governors and deputies after leaving office.\n\nAffected by the bill are former Governors Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Babatunde Fashola, Akinwunmi Ambode and others. Current governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu will also be affected.\n\nThe new bill which was debated on the floor of the House at a sitting presided over by the Speaker, Rt. Hon. (Dr) Mudashiru Obasa, is titled \u2018A Bill for a law to repeal the law to provide for the payment of pensions and other fringe benefits to public office holders in Lagos State and for other connected matters\u2019.\n\nThe lawmakers argued that it would not be too good to repeal the law in its entirety as there were some important sections and stipulations that should be considered.\n\nSpeaking concerning the bill, Hon. Oluyinka Ogundimu (Agege 2), explained that the bill is to ensure the stoppage of pensions to governors and deputies when they leave office adding that this decision was in consideration of the country\u2019s current economic challenges.\n\nOgundimu argued that the governors and their deputies and other such political office holders should be made to enjoy some benefits no matter how little.\n\nHe also argued that the bill should be amended in such a way that it would not throw former political officers to security challenges since if the original law is repealed, it would mean withdrawing all security agents and domestic staff earlier attached to them.\n\nOn his part, Hon. Gbolahan Yishawu (Eti-Osa 2), noted that the parliament has the power to make and review laws, especially where it includes one like the pension bill that was passed 14 years ago and needs to be looked at again.\n\nHe said the objective of the bill as raised by the executive is to ensure that the state begins to look inward in relation to cost of governance.\n\nHe added that by virtue of his position as chairman of the committee on economic planning and budget, he has had the opportunity to check the finances of the state and would say Lagos is not very rich, but only has people who effectively manage its resources.\n\nHe also agreed that the security of the lives of such political office holders when they leave office should be considered urging that the bill be committed to a committee.\n\nContributing, Hon. Rotimi Abiru (Shomolu 2), said he supports an amendment to the law instead of a repeal.\n\n\u201cFor a person who has served as chief executive of a state, I do not think it is nice denying them of their benefits.\n\n\u201cI can appreciate that some of them move to other appointments. For these people, there can be a caveat. But for those who serve in that capacity and do not have any other thing to do after office, it may not be something elaborate, but something may be coming to them periodically,\u201d he said.\n\nHon. Tobun Abiodun (Epe 1) said he does not subscribe to a total repeal of the law because it would give room to corruption in office.\n\nHe said provisions should be made available to governors, deputies and possibly speakers after they leave office.\n\nOther lawmakers who supported amendment to the law include Hon. Jude Idimogu )Oshodi-Isolo 2), Hon. Saad Olumo (Ajeromi-Ifelodun 1) and Hon. Abdulsobur Olawale (Mushin 2).\n\nWhile rounding off the debate, Speaker Obasa observed the questions and suggestions raised by the lawmakers.\n\nHe also supported arguments that repealing the law in totality would expose former governors and deputies to security challenges.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should trash it in totality,\u201d he said as he committed the bill to the House Committee on Establishment with a two-week mandate for a reported to be submitted.",

          "text": "The prohibition on open grazing enacted by the Southern Governors has been chastised by the White House. The Southern Governors allegedly attempted to impose a moratorium on open grazing to display their dominance, according to the report.\n\nOn Monday, Garba Shehu, a senior special assistant to the President on media and publicity, issued a statement to that effect. President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Shehu said, has indicated a strong commitment to resolving herder conflicts, as well as the problem of gun-wielding \u201ckilling herdsmen.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cPresident had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture, in a report he submitted and the President signed off on back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum, which attempted to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that their resolutions did not provide a solution to the herder-farmer conflicts that have raged in our nation for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, inhabitants of the southern states \u2013 indeed, people of all Nigerian states \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find solutions to governance and human rights concerns, rather than to wash their hands of difficult decisions by issuing prohibitions that declare, \u201cNot in my state.\u201d\n\nMr Shehu further stated that their announcement is problematic in legal terms.\n\nHe underlined the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms in each of our 36 states (and the Federal Capital Territory), regardless of where they were born or live.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever purpose it is intended, and Mr. President, who has rightly been concerned about these issues more than any other citizen, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, beginning with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant, in consultation with farmers and herders alike.\n\nWith veterinary clinics, animal watering stations, and schools for herders and their families, the Federal Government is bringing far-reaching and practical changes to these rehabilitated areas, allowing various populations to coexist side by side: assisting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their cattle, and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the financial hardship the COVID-19 pandemic has had on both the federal and state governments. Nonetheless, given the critical need to solve the persistent problems, federal financing for the long-delayed project is now being partially freed. In a few of the agreeing states, work on fully implementing the current reserve system should begin in June.\u201d\n\nNEWS DIRECT recalls that seventeen governors from the country\u2019s southern area gathered in Asaba, Delta state, two weeks ago.\n\nA ban on open-grazing of cattle and the need for ranching are among the state governors\u2019 resolutions. The Governors also discussed the urgent necessity for reorganization in order to achieve parity with other areas.\n\nHowever, the meeting\u2019s statement has sparked arguments about whether the restriction is lawful or not.",

          "text": "About one hundred persons have been reportedly killed within three days in a sustained attack by gunmen suspected to be herders in four wards of Katsina Ala local government area of Benue state.\n\nThe attack, which started Saturday, Blueprint learnt, had continued through Sunday till Monday.\n\nThe council Chairman, Alfred Atera, said many people in the area were moving out of their communities over the attack which had already claimed the lives of about one hundred persons.\n\nHe said four council wards were under attack by the Fulani marauders, including Yoyo, Utange, Mbatyula/Mberev and Mbayongo.\n\n\u201cFour council wards are being attacked by the herdsmen in Katsina Ala local government area and they include, Yooyo, Utange, Mbatyula / Mberev and Mbayongo council wards.\n\n\u201cAbout a hundred people have been killed by the herdsmen if not more at different places. As the attackers are going, they are killing and dropping their victims. We have not been able to recover many people.\n\n\u201cI informed the military about the attack, but these people have developed a strategy, they are not attacking one place. If they attacked Kwaghaondo village for instance, they quickly moved to another place. So, before the military could go there, they will move to another place and continue with their offensive.\n\n\u201cI have reported the incident to all the security agencies and they are aware. As I am speaking to you, I am in my office in the headquarters of the LG speaking to my traditional rulers to see what we can do in their own level.\n\n\u201cOn the allegations whether the military is compromising, he said the military were not conniving but it seems the aggrieved Gana Boys have joined forces with the herdsmen to carry out the attack.\n\n\u201cNo military connivance but I am suspecting the bandits, the existing bandits there. The Gana remnants are conniving with them to cause the havoc and unrest in our area.\n\n\u201cI think they are trying to win a cheap popularity. They have connived to do that so that we consider their demands which we have refused to do,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen contacted at the time of this report, the Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, DSP Catherine Sewuese Anene said she was yet to receive the report of the attack.\n\nPolice confirm 7 killed in Plateau\n\nAlso, the Plateau state police Command Monday confirmed that seven persons were killed Sunday night by unknown gunmen in Dong locality of Jos South local government area of the state.\n\nThe police spokesman, ASP Ubah Ogaba, in a statement early hours of Monday confirmed the incident to journalists via Whatsapp platform.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday 23/05/2021 at about 2000hrs, the command received a distress call that yet to be identified gunmen came out suddenly from a nearby bush, invaded Dong Village, Jos South LGA and killed seven persons,\u201d he said.\n\nOgaba further stated that the \u201ccombined team of policemen, STF, vigilante operatives, led by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Department of Operation, raced swiftly to the scene, but the hoodlums had already fled back into the bush.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is ongoing. Frantic effort is on to arrest the fleeing suspects. Meanwhile, security has been beefed up in that area to prevent escalation of violence.\u201d\n\nHowever, the lawmaker representing Plateau North senatorial district in the National Assembly, said contrary to the figure by the police, 14 persons were killed.\n\nA statement by the lawmaker\u2019s media aide, Musa Ashoms, said the attacks took place at two separate places.\n\n\u201cShortly after the IGP issued a Security Alert on likely terror attacks in Jos and the FCT, the blood merchants have visited terror on Dong community adjacent Wild Life Park, Jos and Kwi village, adjacent Yakubu Gowon Airport Heipang on Sunday night, 23/05/21 where 14 persons were butchered to death, including children,\u201d he stated.\n\nLalong reacts\n\nReacting to the development, Governor Simon Lalong frowned at the killings and directed security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nLalong said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the reoccurrence of violence in parts of Dong Kasa in Jos North Local Government Area and Kwi in Riyom on Sunday night where innocent citizens including children and women were murdered in cold blood.\u201d\n\nCommissioner of Information and Communication Dan Manjang in a statement described the act as barbaric, callous and a desperate attempt to rupture the peace and security of the state.\n\nSix kidnapped in Niger\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Police Command has confirmed kidnap of six residents of Gauraka area Tafa local government area of Niger state resulting in protest during which a police station was burnt\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Wasing Abiodun, in a statement in Minna Monday said the command was on top of the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday being 24th May, 2021 at about 0300hrs, unknown gunmen attacked the residents of Angwan-Wazobia in Gauraka area of Tafa LGA where about six persons were abducted. Teams of Policemen were mobilised to the scene and efforts to rescue the victims are being intensified.\u201d\n\nAbiodun further said \u201chowever, at about 0635hrs of same date, some miscreants blocked both sides of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna expressway, protesting the recent cases of kidnapping in the community.\n\n\u201cThe miscreants later extended the protest to Gauraka Police outpost, vandalised and set it ablaze.\u201d\n\nThe command said efforts to disperse the protesters were ongoing as reinforcement had been dispatched from Minna to Area Commander Suleja as well as joint task force from Minna \u2013 Suleja highway to restore normalcy on Abuja \u2013 Kaduna express way.\n\nThe statement restated the command\u2019s calls on members of the public, parents/guardian and community leaders to caution their wards against any act of public disturbance as the Command shall continue the onslaught against criminal elements in the society.\n\n5 abducted victims rescued\n\nSimilarly, troops of Operation Safe Haven have rescued two people kidnapped while travelling along Gidan Waya-Godogodo-Jagindi road, and three herders together with their 86 cows both in Jema\u2019a local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nA statement issued Monday by the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, said the troops were on the trail of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining two travellers.\n\nHe added that a notorious armed robber was arrested in Gidan Waya.\n\n\u201cTroops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) reported the rescue of two victims who were abducted by armed bandits along Gidan Waya-Godogodo-Jagindi road in Jema\u2019a local government area.\n\n\u201cThe commissioner was briefed at the Headquarters of Sector 7, Operation Safe Haven, Kafanchan, by the Sector Commander, Colonel D.C Nwakonobi while on a routine visit to military formations across the Southern Kaduna general area on Monday.\n\n\u201cAccording to the briefing, four passengers were abducted from a vehicle plying the route. On receiving a distress call, a patrol team from OPSH pursued the bandits and rescued the two victims. Efforts to apprehend the bandits and rescue the other victims are ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe Commander also said that the troops rescued three herders after they had been attacked at a location in the same LGA. The herders, Suleiman Mohammad, Hassan Adamu and Ya\u2019u Mokariyo, along with their 86 cows were escorted to safety by the troops, as they proceeded on their way to Jagindi.\n\n\u201cHe further informed the Commissioner, that a notorious armed robber, Umar Yusuf, was arrested by troops following an attack on private apartments which housed students of the College of Education, Gidan Waya.\n\n\u201cThe Commander said these developments occurred between Sunday night and early hours of Monday.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nFollowing recent kidnapping of 37 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation Afaka, Federal Government has concluded plans to temporarily relocate the College to a safer location within Kaduna metropolis.\n\nJust as the government announced that school fees of all the 37 kidnapped and released students have been waived throughout their study in the Institution.\n\n\n\nProvost of the College, Dr. Usman Bello, disclosed this on Monday while addressing a press conference at the College in Afaka, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna state.\n\nBandits had on March 11, 2021 stormed the College around 10pm kidnapping 39 students, mostly females. While two escaped, 10 of them were released in two batch of five each on 5th and 12th April, 2021 respectively, the remaining 27 students were released on 5th May, after spending 56 days in captivity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Prevost, \u201cthe Hon. Minister of Environment, Dr. Muhammad Mahmood Abubakar has concluded plans to temporarily relocate the College to a safer place; put in place adequate security as well as vehicles to serve as shuttle to convey staff and students alike from the temporary site to designated bus stops within the Kaduna metropolis.\n\n\u201cAll these would be communicated to all as soon as the arrangement has been perfected.The Hon. Minister has directed that the school fees of the affected students be waived for the programmes they are currently running. Therefore, for those of them presently on ND programme, the HND fees would be waived accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSpeaking further, the Provost said, \u201cIt is important to state at this juncture that the frantic efforts of all the stakeholders including the Hon. Minister and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, the Board Chairman, DG-FRIN and the Commissioner of Police, Kaduna state Command, Alhaji Umar Musa Muri, led to the rescue of the first 10 set of the abducted students.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe remaining students in captivity had to endure 55 days after their abduction before they were finally released by the bandits on Wednesday 5th May, 2021.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna state Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, finally delivered the 27 students to the College on 7th May, 2021 alongside the Commissioner of Police, Kaduna state Command amidst a jubilant gathering of the college management, staff, parents and students with members of the press from local and international media covering the event.\n\n\u201cAfter another head count was taken following the release of all the abducted students, I would like to set the record straight that 37 students were taken into captivity against the 39 earlier reported. This is due to the subsequent escape of two of the students during the incident. I am therefore pleased to inform you that all the 37 students have been successfully reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Almighty God for His divine intervention. I also wish to express our profound gratitude to Sheikh (Dr.) Ahmad Gumi and other stakeholders for their relentless efforts that culminated into the release of the students. The College is also appreciative of all the security agencies for the role they played during the incident.\n\n\n\n\u201cI equally want to thank all the parents and students for their patience and understanding with the college management during the unfortunate incident. I would like to use this medium to appeal to all parents/guardians to allow their children/wards to pursue their education to the end. I want to acknowledge the press for covering this story right from when it broke to this very moment.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

We are starting with government schools and will thereafter move to private schools.\n\n\u201cWe are already in good discussion with both states and private proprietors to ensure that this is done because this is the single largest investment you can make to your country, the future generation in ensuring that they get good quality education\u201d, he said.\n\nThe permanent secretary added that the conduct of the examination has been encouraging due to some new IT features introduced to checkmate issues of malpractices.\n\n\u201cThe process is seamless and with the introduction of technology, we also improving efficiency and innovations. We believe that going forward, this is something that people can look up to in a regular calendar and as a prerequisite for you to become a teacher in this country. So if you do not have this certification, you are not a teacher; you do not have the right to practice.\n\nEchono also disclosed that the ministry is collaborating with Ministry of Communication, National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, and other agencies that require data to have a situation where the identity of all primary school children will be stored as soon as a child registers in any primary school in the country.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal in the education sector is to be able to collaborate. We have been doing this with the Ministry of Communication, with NIMC and also with other agencies that require data.\n\n\u201cWe want a situation where from the point where a child registers in any primary school in this country up to death, you have your records, you can update them as you move on but you cannot change your identity,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, a database of all qualified teachers has been compiled, adding that the government will make available the database to states to facilitate employment of qualified teachers who are not currently engaged.\n\nOn the new salary structure of teachers approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, he said.\u201cNow, even in the public service, every day I am inundated with requests by people who originally studied education but find themselves working in different agencies and ministries, wanting to return to their original careers because now the remuneration will be higher than the civil service scale, and they even have a tenure that extends five years more than what the average civil servant will do.\n\n\u201cAnd again, we have commenced the implementation of this; we are working closely with the head of service; she\u2019s been wonderful and very supportive, and salaries and wages commission to as we speak, computing those rural allowances, science allowances, hazard and so on to ensure that teachers get their reward her on earth and not hereafter.\n\nEarlier, Mrs Jacinta Ogboso, TRCN Acting Director, Specification and Licencing disclosed that about 17,141 were to participate in the batch \u2018A\u2019 examination nationwide.\n\nWhile disclosing that Osun state has the highest number of candidates, she added that all teachers must sit and pass the examination before they would be considered as qualified teachers.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of teachers with special needs, she said that the TRCN chief executive has been addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cThe issue of people with special needs among the teachers is something that cannot be overlooked.

          "title": "EU Agrees New Sanctions, Bans Belarusian Airlines after Plane Arrest",
          "text": "The EU has decided to ban Belarusian airlines from European skies after a flight was diverted to Minsk on Sunday and a dissident journalist arrested.\n\nAt a meeting in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 member states also told EU airlines not to fly over Belarus, and promised further economic sanctions.\n\nRoman Protasevich, 26, was on a flight from Greece to Lithuania which was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat.\n\nWestern countries accused Belarus of \u201chijacking\u201d the Ryanair plane.\n\nA video has now emerged of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress since his detention at Minsk airport.\n\nIn the clip, which was released late on Monday, the journalist said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state.\n\nBut activists, including the country\u2019s main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing.\n\nUS President Joe Biden described the actions of the Belarusian authorities as \u201coutrageous\u201d, saying they were \u201cshameful assaults on both political dissent and the freedom of the press\u201d.\n\nMr Protasevich\u2019s father has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured.\n\nDmitri Protasevich said on Monday he was \u201creally afraid\u201d of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country.\n\n\u201cWe hope that he will cope. We are afraid to even think about it, but it\u2019s possible he could be beaten and tortured. We are really afraid of that,\u201d he said in a video call.\n\n\u201cWe are really shocked and really upset,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sort of thing shouldn\u2019t be happening in the 21st Century at the heart of Europe.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the whole international community, including the European Union, will put unprecedented pressure on the authorities. We hope the pressure will work and the authorities will realise they\u2019ve made a really big mistake.\u201d\n\nHow Events Unfolded\n\nBelarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 \u2013 which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania \u2013 to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nPolice then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane\u2019s 126 passengers disembarked.\n\nThe activist, who witnesses said was \u201csuper scared\u201d, was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.\n\nMs Sapega\u2019s mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was \u2018Mummy\u2019.\n\nThe accusations against her are unclear.\n\nBelarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners, and witnesses said Mr Protasevich told fellow passengers he feared he would face the death penalty.\n\nThree other passengers did not reach the plane\u2019s final destination in Vilnius. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said he believed some Belarusian KGB agents also departed the plane at Minsk, but this has not been independently verified.\n\nBelarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nA senior transport official read a letter to reporters that he claimed was from the militant group.\n\n\u201cIf you do not fulfil our demands, the bomb will explode over Vilnius,\u201d it said.\n\nBut Hamas has denied any involvement. The group has no history or known capability of mounting operations outside Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nGerman leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was \u201ccompletely implausible\u201d.\n\nThe incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation.\n\nDozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents.\n\nState media in Belarus said Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, personally gave the order for the plane to be diverted.\n\nThe 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile.\n\nWho Roman Protasevich Is\n\nMr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania.\n\nFrom there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots.\n\nNexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote, which was won by Mr Lukashenko and is widely regarded as rigged.\n\nIt has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts.\n\nMr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova.\n\nHe stepped in to write for it after blogger Igor Losik was arrested by the Belarusian authorities in June last year.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has criticised and appeared to query the legality of the decision by Governors of the country\u2019s southern states to ban open grazing in their region.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also said there was no solution offered from resolutions of the governors to the herder-farmer clashes.\n\nMr Buhari stated this on Monday while describing the actions of the Southern Governors Forum as acts of politicking intended to demonstrate their power.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s views were expressed in a statement by his spokesman Garba Shehu who noted that \u201cthe President had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture in a report he submitted and the President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power\u201d.\n\nHe added further that \u201cIt is very clear that there was no solution offered from their resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in our country for generations.\n\n\u201cBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Shehu, the President has approved an actionable plan that will lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between farmers and gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
