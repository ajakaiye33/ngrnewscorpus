          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Kingmakers of the Owu kingdom in Ogun State have screened seven princes jostling for the Olowu of Owu stool in Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State.\n\nObasanjo, who is the Balogun of the Owu kingdom led other Kingmakers in the statutory selection process, which lasted for about seven hours on Wednesday, March 30.\n\nThey have however forwarded the list of the elected candidates to the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, for approval and announcement of the new Olowu.\n\nThe Otileta Ruling House, following the notice by the Abeokuta North Local Government area, as the ruling house to produce the next Olowu of Owu had screened 12 princes, who were nominated by five compounds that made up the Ruling House.\n\nOur Correspondent gathered that out of the 12 princes screened, seven of them were, however, cleared and nominated on March 10, including an Archbishop of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr. Adegbemi Adewale.\n\nThe six other candidates nominated along with Adewale, who has PhD in African law and from Ile Aderinoye, are Princes Adelani Oladimeji from Ile Omo\u2019le Efon; Matemilola Adelola from Ile Soke and Olatidoye Olaniyi from Soke.\n\nOthers are Princes Adeyanju Bakinson from Ile Otopo; Simeon Soyele from Ile Lumosa and Adesina Adelani from Ile Soke.\n\nIt was further gathered that there was no voting by the delegates during the screening, scores were awarded based on the performances of each of the candidates, at the screening and interview sessions.\n\nAccording to the results sheet, Prince Adegbemi Adewale, a PhD holder, came first with 1,027 points; Prince Adelani Oladimeji, scored 909 points, and Matemilola Adelola scored 886 points, while Prince Olatidoye Olaniyi scored 863 points.\n\nOther scores are Prince Adeyanju Bakinson, 862 points; Simeon Soyele, 827 points, and Adesina Adelani, 801 points.\n\nOur correspondent gathered following the nomination, the kingmakers led by Obasanjo last Wednesday conducted seven hours of screening on all the princes.\n\nImpeccable sources from the palace hinted that Obasanjo had addressed the seven candidates before and after the rounds of interviews which was witnessed by both the Abeokuta North Local Government Secretary and other officials.\n\nOne of the sources said the process was \u201cthorough, transparent and neat because everyone was engaged by the Kingmakers.\u201d\n\nThe source further said that no voting took place during the exercise but the kingmakers had forwarded their report to Governor Dapo Abiodun.\n\nAccording to the sources, \u201cObasanjo said the outcome of the screening lies on the shoulders of the Executive Governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun whose statutory duty is to announce the Oba.\u201d\n\nHundreds of the sons and daughters of the kingdom had thronged the Oke Ago-Owu, Palace of the Olowu where the Kingmakers were interviewing the candidates, hoping to receive an announcement of the Olowu-elect.\n\nThe governor is expected to announce the new Olowu, in a matter of days, it was reliably gathered.\n\nThe Olowu stool became vacant, following the demise of the late Oba Adegboyega Dosumu, who joined his ancestors on December 12, 2021.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

She attenbded such institutions like University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), Rivers State University of Science and Technology (RUST) and Nigerian Teaching Institution (NTI).

          "text": "Public Relations and media professionals and other important institutions/agents of change in Nigeria have been urged to join advocacy for gender balancing, inclusion and fairness for the promotion of socio-economic development in the country.\n\nMrs. Grace Bose Ojougboh, Head, Media and Public Relations at the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and producer/host of the weekly inspirational programme \u2018Amazing Grace with Bose\u2019 on YouTube, made the call while delivering a paper around gender balancing and fairness at the March 2022 monthly meeting of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Abuja Chapter, which took place at the National Press Centre, Radio House, Abuja recently (Wednesday March 30, 2021).\n\nSpeaking to NIPR members, including Fellows of the Institute at the event on the thought-provoking paper titled: \u201cAchieving Gender Equality In Nigeria: The Role Of Public Relations\u201d, Ojougboh re-awakened the consciousness of the audience to the often-misconstrued concept of feminism while taking pragmatic look at how this concept should be understood by all to actualise the lofty desire of maximizing the innate potentials of female gender towards achieving greater developmental goals in the society.\n\nShe equated feminism with the philosophical aspiration for gender equality as a fundamental human right, which also finds concrete expression in the Goal Five of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) centering on gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls with the hope to end all acts of discrimination against the female gender.\n\nOjougboh noted with copious instances, that, till date, issues pertaining to women gender had not always received the expected attention, whether by government, parents, the media, communication professionals; traditional and religious leaders, adding that there was need for a change of narrative with respect to how issues pertaining to gender balancing and fairness are effectively mainstreamed into Nigeria\u2019s developmental drive.\n\nAccording to her, the continuous imbalance in women participation in politics and governance and all the sectors of the economy is glaring.\n\nShe submitted that women are given almost no opportunity to participate in politics and in other spheres of life, noting that this is in spite of the advocacy and call for inclusion and the strategies by various international agencies to reduce gender inequality to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, bills seeking gender equality were rejected by the National Assembly. Appointments across parastatals are dominated by men, this has got to change. If we want economic growth, we must include women, women are transformational agents. We need much more that 35 per cent affirmative action,\u201d she said.\n\nShe stated that the fact that women represent about 50 per cent of Nigerian population, according to a 2020 report, means that Nigeria, as a country, cannot afford to neglect the wisdom and the capability of this group and the contribution that women can bring to make Nigeria a truly prosperous nation.\n\nJustifying the need for media/Public Relations practitioners to be at the forefront of driving the narrative for gender balancing, Ojougboh cited an empirical study on media and gender inequality in Nigerian politics, which found that women were denied fair access to the media just as the study also identified media bias in the coverage of female news stories.\n\nShe said the findings of the study is a wake-up call that media and Public Relations practitioners have a whole lot to do in the fight for gender balancing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand our social responsibility as perception drivers to promote unity, social cohesion, gender balancing/equality and the fundamental human rights of every Nigerian,\u201d she said\n\nShe also tasked them to be deliberate and intentional about their communication such that it builds understanding, trust, and acceptance and becomes a win-win for men and women alike and all who desire to see equal representation of men and women across all sectors of the society.\n\n\u201cAs Public Relations practitioners, we must help to create gender-sensitive and gender-transformative content that will change perceptions and break gender stereotypes.\n\n\u201cWe must use every available medium to challenge traditional and cultural norms and attitudes that demean womanhood and does not serve humanity,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Benue State is one of the states where a change of leadership must happen in 2023. This is because Governor Samuel Ortom will be completing his second term of four years in office by then and will not be eligible to seek another shot at the position. Expectedly, the race to succeed Ortom is already gathering momentum with several willing contenders daily throwing their hats into the ring of the gubernatorial contest.\n\nEarlier this month, Governor Ortom said God has not revealed his successor to him assuring that he has no preferred candidate in the coming general elections and has also not anointed anyone as his successor. He said, \u201cthough God has not revealed to me who will succeed me as Governor, I believe that with due consultations with major stakeholders, a strong hearted person who will preserve and protect the land will be chosen.\u201d\n\nAn ongoing attempt by the PDP in the state to prune the number of its governorship aspirants, as advised by the governor is causing crisis within the ruling party as some aspirants are already crying wolf and vowing to reject the outcome of the exercise. They described a pruning process for the aspirants as faulty, unfair and capable of denying the party victory at the forthcoming general elections in the state if allowed, while faulting the inability of the leadership of the party in the State to draw up guidelines for the exercise.\n\nWithin the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), not less than a dozen aspirants have officially declared their interest in the party\u2019s 2023 guber ticket. Observers of the politics of the state say the contest for the APC ticket will be a fierce one going by the caliber and political antecedents of some of the contenders. The party, which lost the state to PDP in 2019 following the defection of Governor Ortom, is determined to stage a comeback come in 2023. This perhaps explains why the APC is parading numerous governorship aspirants.\n\nParty sources told The Nation that the APC is currently being hugely publicized in the nooks and crannies of the state by the governorship aspirants, who are going round the three senatorial districts to talk to party members and other citizens, set up offices and made their presence felt at every major functions and ceremonies across the state. \u201cSome of them are known to have also built financial war chests in readiness for the elections. They are moving round every sector of the state like the tentacles of the Octopus. The result is that everywhere in Benue state today, people are aware the APC is ready to sack the PDP from office. Our party is the party of Benue people and they are eagerly waiting to vote APC back into Government House,\u201d a party chieftain told The Nation.\n\nZoning agitation\n\nAs the two leading parties prepare for the looming political face-off, leaders and elders of the southern senatorial district of Benue state, also known as Zone C, are insisting that it is their turn to produce the next governor after Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s administration.\n\nAs part of efforts to better the chances of the zone in the forthcoming election, after what they described as a rigorous selection process, leaders and elders of the southern senatorial district recently led other stakeholders to present the current deputy governor of the state, Engr. Benson Abounu, to the governor as the consensus candidate of the zone.\n\nThe gathering, which cuts across religious, ethnic and political lines, told the governor to support Abounu in the interest of the zone\u2019s quest for equity, fairness and justice. \u201cSince the creation of Benue from Plateau State, the governorship position has only rotated between Zone A and B, leaving zone C, which is dominated by Idoma ethnic group with deputy governorship position year in, year out,\u201d a chieftain of the ruling party told The Nation.\n\nThe Nation however gathered that the endorsement of Abounu by the stakeholders have not gone down well with some people in the zone. But the leadership of the forum is not leaving any stone unturned in their quest to ensure his choice enjoys the support of all and sundry across the senatorial district. \u201cWe expected dissents and we are working hard to address all grievances. What is important to us is to see the next governor come from our zone,\u201d a traditional ruler said on Thursday.\n\nThe contenders\n\nChief Barnabas Gemade\n\nChief Gemade, a former national chairman of the PDP, was also the Managing Director of the defunct Benue Cement, Gboko, now Dangote cement. He served as Secretary of Works in late Sani Abacha\u2019s military regime. He contested for president against the former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and was elected into the national assembly to represent Benue northeast senatorial zone for two terms of eight years. He is 72 years old.\n\nTerwase Orbunde\n\nTerwase Orbunde is a former federal legislator who is not a newcomer to the politics and governance of the state. He is widely connected within the ruling PDP and quite an experienced politician. Believed to be very close to the governor, his ambition is widely said to be tied around the governor as he is generally seen as one of the governor\u2019s favoured aspirants for the governorship position by 2023. He is a PDP chieftain.\n\nChief Mike Aondoakaa\n\nChief Mike Aondoakaa, former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, is another APC governorship aspirant. He is the chairman of Mikap Nig .Limited, a multi million naira rice milling company with a modern factory in Makurdi.\n\nChief Steven Lawani\n\nChief Steven Lawani is the only governorship aspirant on the platform of APC from Benue south senatorial zone. Lawani was the deputy governor to Senator Gabriel Suswam for eight years. What Chief Lawani has going for him is the zoning consideration. Since the creation of Benue from Plateau State, no person from his zone has occupied Government House.\n\nTitus Uba\n\nHon. Titus Uba is the current Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly. He has formally declared interest in the PDP ticket. He is from the Jechira geo- political bloc. His ambition did not come to many as a surprise, been the highest political office holder from the bloc as Speaker of the State Assembly. His supporters are hoping that he will be rewarded for his total loyalty to the governor.\n\nProfessor Terhemba Shija\n\nProfessor Terhemba Shija, 60 is a Tiv-born Professor of English Studies at the Nasarawa State University, Keffi. He was a House Representatives member and was also Commissioner for Information and Culture; Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs.\n\nTerver Akase\n\nGovernor Ortom\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, is an aspirant whose ambition surprised a lot of people even as some speculators say he has the backing of the governor. He has said nothing can stop him from contesting the primary as he ready to go all the way.\n\nMark Tersoo Hanmantion\n\nMark Tersoo Hanmantion is 38 year-old and he is not pretending about his ambition to replace Ortom on the platform of APC. Analysts say he took Benue by storm and has vigorously traversed all the 23 local government areas of the state campaigning.\n\nHon. Herman Hembe\n\nHerman Hembe, is the 45 years old politician son of highly respected Late Professor Godwin Nyor Hembe, a Political Science scholar. The young Hembe is a lawyer who is currently serving his fourth term as a federal lawmaker. He is the member representing Vandeikya/Konshisha Federal Constituency of Benue State at the National Assembly.\n\nProfessor Dennis Ityavyar\n\nDennis Ityavyar is current Commissioner for Education a Professor of Sociology. He is close to the governor and pundits say if he gets Ortom\u2019s endorsement as being speculated, he could emerge as the candidate of the ruling PDP despite being almost unknown in the state\u2019s political circles before now.\n\nOthers\n\nAlso being touted as possible contenders in the race for the APC governorship ticket in Benue state are Dr.Mathise Byuan, Hon Nick Wende, DR. John Tor Tsuwa and Richard Tersoo Mnenge.

          "title": "Akwa-Ibom: Crises rock PDP, APC over alleged imposition plots, zoning",
          "text": "The races towards the 2023 gubernatorial tickets of both the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) have already peaked with chieftains of the two political parties now at war over who should fly the parties\u2019 banners at the next governorship election in Akwa Ibom state.\n\nWhile the succession plan of the state governor, Emmanuel Udom, has thrown the PDP in the state into disarray, the APC is battling an internal crisis occasioned by alleged moves by some party leaders to impose John Udoedehe, Secretary of the party\u2019s CEPCC, as its gubernatorial candidate.\n\nThis is just as stakeholders in the three senatorial districts of the state are still enmeshed in a fierce debate over which zone should produce the next governor of the state. While some sources within and outside the leading political parties insisted the state had always deferred to an unwritten zoning arrangement in determining who occupies the Government House since 1999, some others insisted the governorship race in the state had always been an all comers\u2019 affair.\n\nAnother school of thought feels the zoning arrangement shouldn\u2019t be about senatorial districts but the ethnic classifications in the state. This has led to agitations by some ethnic groups in the state like the Orons to be asking for the chance to produce the next governor of the state irrespective of the unwritten arrangement.\n\nThe leadership of the Oron ethnic group recently threatened that unless the group is allowed to produce the governor of the state, there will be no election in the area come 2023. Leaders of the ethnic group that consists of Oron, Okobo, Udung Uko, Oruko and Mbo local government areas, while insisting that zoning of the governorship seat should be on the basis of ethnic nationalities and not senatorial districts, urged the Ibibio and Annang ethnic groups to respect what they described as the tripod arrangement in the interest of fairness and justice ahead of the next general election.\n\nThere is also a raging debate even among those who subscribe to the zoning arrangement. This sub-set of the debate is over which of the three senatorial districts should take the first shot now that all the three zones have produced governors from 1999 till date.\n\nVictor Attah, from Akwa Ibom North-East senatorial distirct, took the first shot and governed the state between 1999 and 2007. He was succeeded by Godswill Akpabio, current Minister of Niger Delta, who hails from Ukana in Akwa Ibom Nort-West senatorial district of the state. He was in office for eight years between 2007 and 2015. The incumbent governor, Udom Emmanuel, from Eket senatorial district, became governor in 2015 and will be completing his second term in 2023.\n\nTo most pundits, the scenario above places Akwa Ibom North-East (Uyo) senatorial district in pole position to produce the next governor as the zone has not held the governorship since 2007 when Attah left office. While no major party has yet closed their primaries to gubernatorial hopefuls from outside the area, nearly all potential aspirants are from the North-East and it appears as if major parties are holding to the zoning agreement.\n\nSupporting the agitation of the people of Uyo zone, the Special Assistant to Governor Emmanuel on Research and Documentation, Essien Ndueso, said it was the adherence to the zoning arrangement that favoured Governor Emmanuel in 2015. \u201cElection of Governor Emmanuel was made possible after Akwa Ibom people unanimously agreed that going by the existing zoning arrangement, the governorship should go to Eket senatorial district,\u201d he said, while justifying the opinion that Uyo senatorial district should produce the next governor of the state.\n\nPDP\n\nWith more and more party leaders and other stake-holders taking sides in the ongoing face-off that followed Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s public endorsement of a successor last week, the crisis rocking the party is deepening ahead of the 2023 general elections. Sources within the ruling party told our correspondent that the PDP in the south-south state is gradually being shredded into factions ahead of the 2023 general elections in the state.\n\n\u201cWhat started as grumbling after Governor Emmanuel made a public show of declaring one of his commissioners as his preferred successor has gradually degenerated into a serious crisis that is threatening to divide the party. We now have those who are supporting the governor\u2019s decision and those who are strongly opposed to his choice of successor. And I can tell you that it is getting more worrisome by the day,\u201d our source said.\n\nGovernor Emmanuel ended months of speculations and permutations over his succession plan with the announcement of one of his cabinet members, Pastor Umo Eno, as his preferred successor as governor in 2023. He made the announcement at a PDP stakeholders\u2019 meeting at Government House Lodge, Uyo. Emmanuel announced Eno, current Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, as his preferred PDP candidate for the 2023 gubernatorial election in the state.\n\nThe governor\u2019s anointed candidate was thereafter presented to the PDP stakeholders by former Governor Victor Attah, according to reports of the parley. Confirming the reports, the Chief Press Secretary/Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on media, Mr. Ekerete Udoh, said: \u201cAbsolutely true, yes. At the PDP stakeholders\u2019 meeting, His Excellency announced Mr. Umo Eno as the preferred candidate to succeed him. And he was thereafter presented to the PDP stakeholders by former Gov. Victor Attah. So, that is true.\u201d\n\nBut it seems not all stakeholders of the PDP in the state are on the same page with the governor in his decision to anoint Eno. Specifically, some other chieftains of the party who are interested in the governorship ticket of the ruling party are said to be poised for a showdown with the governor over his choice of Eno. \u201cThe party is divided and things are likely to get worse in the days and weeks to come. The unity and peace of our party is threatened,\u201d a party official lamented.\n\nAlready, former Speaker of the Akwa-Ibom House of Assembly and Chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Judiciary, Hon. Onofiok Luke, has announced his readiness to confront the governor all the way over what he described as the undemocratic endorsement of an aspirant over and above other chieftains of the party by the governor who should ordinarily play the role of a father to all and encourage a level playing ground in the contest.\n\nThe federal legislator, who has declared his interest in the PDP governorship ticket, according to reports, stormed out of the stakeholders\u2019 meeting after the endorsement of Eno. Reports also have it that not less than two members of the state cabinet absented themselves from the stakeholders\u2019 meeting on account of their objection to Governor Emmanuel\u2019s plan to unveil Eno as his preferred successor at the event.\n\nAnother guber aspirant of the party told our correspondent that it is wrong of the governor to have said God revealed to him to choose Eno as his successor. \u201cThe governor wants Eno and he want to enthrone him as a stooge so as to continue governing by proxy. His action is causing crisis in the party. Eno is so unpopular. He has been working on the Eno project for months now and they already have a political structure called \u2018Maintain Peace Movement\u2019 to mobilise support for him.\n\nBut the Akwa Ibom State chapter of the PDP says it is fully in support of Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s choice of a successor. The Chairman of the party in the state, Aniekan Akpan, gave the governor the backing when Emmanuel visited the party secretariat during the week, pledging the party\u2019s unalloyed support and loyalty of the party structures across the state to enable the governor actualise his succession plan and completion agenda.\n\n\u201cWe pledge our unflinching support towards the actualisation of your completion agenda. The party, through your support, has stabilised. We commend your achievements. You have done a lot. You are a pride to PDP,\u201d Akpan said while a former state chairman of the party, Paul Ekpo, added that, \u201cWe will ensure that your completion agenda gets to a successful end.\u201d\n\nAPC\n\nTo many observers of the happenings within the opposition APC in Akwa Ibom state, the relative peace enjoyed by the party since 2019 was shattered the very moment some stakeholders in the party asked the Secretary of the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, to contest for the state governorship in 2023.\n\nThe call had barely been made before some prominent leaders and chieftains of the party, including other governorship aspirants, raised alarm, accusing Akpanudoedehe of trying to use his position in the National Working Committee (NWC) to corner the gubernatorial ticket of the APC in Akwa Ibom state for himself. Expectedly, the allegation was strongly refuted by supporters of the APC Scribe. According to them, it will be unfair for anybody to rule out Akpanudoedehe from the governorship race just because he accepted to serve the party when the need arose.\n\nThe beckon on Akpanudoedehe was contained in a communique issued after a stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.The communique, signed by over 40 prominent APC leaders and elder statesmen from the state, noted that Akpanudoedehe is the right person for the state governorship election in 2023. According to the communique, Atuekong Don Etiebet moved the motion for stakeholders to summon Senator Akpanudoedehe to join the governorship race and was seconded by Arch Bishop Samuel Akpan, a governorship candidate in 2015.\n\nThe communique reads part: \u201cAfter exhaustive deliberation, the motion was overwhelmingly passed with a notation for the resolution taken by a credible collection of Akwa Ibom APC stakeholders to be conveyed to the distinguished senator.\u201d\n\nBut some stakeholders of the APC in the state wasted no time before urging aspirants vying for various offices in the 2023 elections not to be dismayed by the recent endorsement of AkpanUdoedehe, as the sole gubernatorial candidate of the party in next year\u2019s polls. While describing such endorsement as ridiculous and undemocratic, the stakeholders urged all aspirants to come forward to indicate their interests, assuring that a level playing ground would be given to them.\n\nThese were contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of an enlarged stakeholders\u2019 meeting of the party held at Kara Event Centre, Uyo. The communiqu\u00e9 was endorsed by Dr. Effiong Etuk, former APC Secretary in the state Dr. Chris Akpan, Chief Sunny Ibanga, Hon. Patti Ettete Ineme, Dr. Emayak Ukpong, Hon. Prince Alex Nyong, Hon. Victor Antai, Mrs. Richard King, Hon. Kufre Akpabio, Hon. Akpabio Ukpa, and many others.\n\nThe stakeholders noted that the convener of the meeting where Udoedeghe was adopted does not have the locus standi to convene or preside over such meeting as he is neither a former Governor nor the highest political office holder as envisaged by the APC constitution. \u201cThat all aspirants are encouraged to indicate interest to contest all offices in the next general elections as a level playing field is guaranteed,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 read in part.\n\nThe stakeholders described the zoning of the chairmanship position of the party and the governorship slot in the forthcoming election to Uyo Senatorial District by a faction of the party as a mark of desperation, which is alien to the progressive ethos and principle which the APC stands for. They also called on President Buhari to call Senator Udoedehe to order, to save the party from implosion recalling that his actions now played out in 2019 which made the APC lose the governorship seat that year.\n\nWorried by recent developments within the party, Hon Uduak Sunday Etim, the convener of Akwa Ibom Progressive League (APL), called on the national leadership of the party to wade in and end the rift plaguing the APC in the state. In the petition he submitted to the APC headquarter in Abuja, Etim asked the top echelon of the party to resolve all issues in the Akwa Ibom State chapter in order to dislodge the PDP in the state come 2023.\n\nReacting recently to the happenings within the party, Press Secretary to Udoedehe, Ata Etuk, said democracy allows individuals or groups to endorse whoever they choose to endorse, adding that it is not wrong to do so. \u201cIs there anything wrong for people to endorse somebody for an election? It happens everywhere in the world and if critical stakeholders of the party say this man has the capacity to lead us, there is nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s allowed in a democracy,\u201d he said. Surprisingly, Akpanudoedehe is yet to declare his interest in the gubernatorial ticket of the party up till this moment.\n\nAspirants\n\nOnofiok\n\nOnofiok Akpan Luke is the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Judiciary. A former Speaker of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly where he served for two terms, he is believed to enjoy huge followership especially among the youth and women. He is also seen as one of the aspirants with the financial muscle to prosecute the governorship contest. His major albatross is the opposition of the governor and the leadership of the PDP in the state to his ambition.\n\nBut he has vowed to go ahead with his aspiration in spite of the oppositions to his ambition. But many observers of the politics of the state are of the opinion that without the state government\u2019s backing, it is left to be seen how he will win the primary election of the PDP.\n\nAkpanudoedeghe\n\nJohn James Akpanudoedehe, a former Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory and former Senator for Akwa Ibom North-East, is expected to formally declare his governorship aspiration now that the tenure of the APC Caretaker Committee is ended with the conclusion of the national convention. He is one man many see as a candidate APC can push forward if it desires to make much impact in the 2023 guber contest.\n\nHis supporters are quick to recall his governorship contest against then governor Akpabio in 2011 while pushing for his candidacy. He commands a large following across the state being no newcomer to the guber race.\n\nSenator Bassey Akpan\n\nSenator Bassey Albert Akpan, a.k.a OBA, who was ex-Governor Akpabio\u2019s finance commissioner for about seven years, is another leading aspirant on the platform of the PDP. He is currently in the senate for a second term . Many believe he has the resources to struggle for the party\u2019s ticket with anybody or group as he has been holding government positions in the last sixteen years nonstop.\n\nBesides, OBA is reputed to have a strong political structure across the state on account of his past electioneering processes. His supporters are even optimistic that he has enough clout within the party structure to land him the ticket should the direct or indirect mode of primary election be adopted. And being from Itu/Ibiono zone which has not produced a governor since the creation of the state, he is favoured by the ongoing clamour for rotation.\n\nEffiong Bob\n\nAlso in the race is former Senate committee chairman on services, Effiong Bob. He is a grassroots mobiliser credited with a lot of political experiences. His supporters say he is currently watching the unfolding political drama within the ruling PDP and considering his options. He is one aspirant pundits believe will be well guided in deciding what to do in the face of the governor\u2019s endorsement of an aspirant.\n\nEnang\n\nOne of those who have already thrown their hats into the ring is Senator Ita Enang, Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari and a former Senator who represented Akwa Ibom North-East between 2011 and 2015. He was also in the House of Representatives from1999 to 2011. He is running on the platform of the APC and pundits say he is one of the favourites for the ticket.\n\nUmo Eno\n\nPastor Umo Eno is the preferred candidate of Governor Emmanuel Udom and the leadership of the PDP in the state. Expectedly, he is the leading aspirant in the race as we speak. He got the endorsement of the National Assembly caucus of the state during the week and has been enjoying the backings of many of the party\u2019s elders.\n\nObservers of the politics of the state claim he started attracting attention immediately he entered the governorship race.\n\nIt is left to be seen whether the sudden following is a fluke to please the governor or whether he can stand his ground when the heat starts coming. Many people within and outside the state are also waiting to see how he will appeal to the people of the state to see him as his own man and not a puppet of Governor Udom\u2019s. How he handles these crucial expectations will determine how far he can go in the race.\n\nOthers\n\nOther names being mentioned in the race include Akan Udofia, an international businessman, who is seen a political neophyte. It is however not clear in which party he would pitch his tent but there are speculations that he may be contesting on the APC platform. Also seen as one other person that can clinch the ticket of the PDP is the current Commissioner for Information and Strategy in the state, Ini Emembong. The former Publicity Secretary of the PDP in the state has attracted massive publicity to his aspiration even before formally declaring his intention.\n\nAkan Okon, former Commissioner for Economic Development and the Ibom Deep Seaport is also a contender for the PDP ticket. Ide Owodiong-Idemeko, who was 2019 PDP Akwa Ibom North-East senatorial aspirant, is also said to be preparing to join the race. Also being mentioned is Ani Wellington, Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Oil and Gas.",

          "title": "Buhari got it wrong on Omisore\u2019s emergence as APC Secretary, says Soyinka",
          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka yesterday questioned the propriety of last weekend\u2019s emergence of Otunba Iyiola Omisore as National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSoyinka, in a statement ,wondered why the former deputy governor of Osun State should be anointed for the party position not too long after President Muhammadu Buhari Buhari ordered the Inspector-General of Police to resume investigations of unresolved murder cases in the country including that of former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Chief Bola Ige (SAN).\n\nOmisore, he said, is a prime suspect in the Ige murder.\n\nSoyinka, in the statement entitled \u201cPerhaps closed files should remain just that-Closed?\u201d said: \u201cNot for a moment does one suggest that mere accusation, even trial, presumes Guilt. More than mere verdict is involved in any trial however. The process of arriving at that ultimate destination \u2013 justice \u2013 is integral to the very concept of democracy and equality under the law. That process is one of the structures of civic education.\n\n\u201cUnresolved till today were quite a number of untidy, even suspect aspects of investigation, prosecution and trials, aspects which revealed improper cell co-habitation by suspects under custody. That this led necessarily to recantations of earlier depositions is not thereby proven, but the fact remains that such U-turns did take place.\n\n\u201cOne was so brazen that it induced a heart attack that proved fatal to the victim\u2019s wife, another Justice \u2013 Mrs. Atinuke Ige. That the prime suspect was privileged in a number of improper ways went beyond mere allegation. Political interventions, including pressure on the judiciary during bail hearings, cannot be denied. A judge under such pressure kept a diary with accusations, pages of which he consigned to friends for safekeeping.\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of the said prime suspect as National Secretary of the Ruling Party, is the Inspector-General of Police equipped to confront political obstacles in a resumption of investigation? Is there any guarantee that the result will see the light of day? How suspect, ab initio, will be the conclusions, given the present political ordering?\n\n\u201cI repeat: we are speaking of blatant, undeniable exercise of political interventions during investigations and the arraignment of suspects. Prior incumbency of the position of National Secretary of a ruling party has demonstrated the potent interventionist clout that can be wielded from that office.\n\n\u201cThe president has personally received, and thus anointed the new incumbent.

          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nChief Frank Kokori is a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). But just like other concerned Nigerians, he is worried about the festering security situation in the country especially the new wave of attacks on all means of transportation.\n\nIn this interview, he urged the Buhari administration to take a frank audit of its failings in the past six and half years with a view to addressing them frontally.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nHow would you react to the escalating security situation in Nigeria especially the recent attacks by bandits on Kaduna-bound trains?\n\nAll Nigerians are worried about the security situation in the country. And most of these security breaches are very embarrassing. For me, I think the security personnel are collaborating. Don\u2019t you see the kind of weapon those ragtag bandits are carrying? Can they match the ammunition available to the Nigerian army? So, it seems to me very shameful. There is no way we can march on like this among comity of nations. We have the biggest army in Africa and there is threat of insecurity here and there. So much money has been invested in the security of this country. When you compare it with GDP of other countries, it is one of the highest. But the people in charge of it, security, are collaborating. That is why you see some retired generals are billionaire. How can a star general even have millions in his account and several property? Is that not corruption? All these things are obvious, although some of them are extreme nationalists and patriots. Anyway, they are like other human beings. I know the temptations I faced during pro-democracy struggle in this country. I am an elder statesmen, I don\u2019t feel happy hearing some of these things. How can you imagine bandits carrying away over 200 school-children in one swoop and nobody will detect them for months. All this is a clear failure on the part of the government. In this digital age, a lot of things ought to be done.\n\nIn the face of all of this, the ruling APC and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been trading blames over an alleged plot to destabilize the country. How does it sound to you?\n\nNo responsible government will see people who want to destroy the country and fold its arms. Let nobody come and tell us this kind of rubbish. I am an APC man; they should leave the PDP out of this matter. The buck stops on the table of the Commander-in-Chief. Lai Muhammed should not come and tell us this kind of childish thing. If you know the people who want to destablise the country, you round them up. That is what we want to hear. Are we school children?\n\nThe three pronged agenda of this government is security, economy and anti-corruption. At this stock-taking period, how would you rate the performance of this administration based on these indices?\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nWe were in the forefront of the people who were supporting Buhari at that time. Even we in the Niger Delta did so at the risk of our lives because Goodluck Jonathan was in power then. But I felt Jonathan was a lame president. So, we thought Buhari was what he used to be in the early 80s, we thought he would do wonders. But since he came to power, Nigerians have been short-changed. He may be a good man, but he is tired. And he is one president you can\u2019t even reach except the cabal around him. I am a member of the moribund Board of Trustees of the APC, I can\u2019t reach him. He dictates the shot and everybody must follow. It is not that I am supporting the PDP; there is nothing in the PDP. In most countries, there is a two-party system. But APC can still spring surprises with a good presidential candidate and we know the people. The PDP too can spring up a good candidate that will work for the good of the country. That is why you can\u2019t write them off. The APC could be revolutionized. So, we cannot write off APC because of Buhari. The only thing is that Buhari is tired in terms of age, mental capacity and health. I am saying this because I am of the same age with him and I know what people like us pass through. Kokori of today is not the same Kokori of 70s and 80s. Even then, you can govern well with trust. The truth is that the bad ones among the Fulani are not being punished for the bad things they are doing. How can someone invade people\u2019s farm, destroy their farms, rape their women and go scot-free? Yet, you call the police and the police look the other way because they have order from the above. Rubbish! You don\u2019t run a country like that.\n\nWhat then do you see ahead as the country approaches the next general elections amidst this atmosphere of insecurity?\n\nWe will conduct elections smoothly if the INEC is serious with its preparations with the use of card readers. We will have good leaders as long as the parties present good candidates. APC can present a good man and change everything. The PDP can present a good man and change everything. Buhari had an image of a patriotic leader when he was younger, but now he is tired.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAPC\u2019s convention has come and gone. There is now a new National Working Committee to take charge of the affairs of the party. But there is still the hurdle of presidential primary. Do you see the possibility of the kind of consensus arrangement that happened during the convention?\n\nIf they can agree on consensus of a good person, good luck. For me, there should be real voting for presidential candidate. If you lose, it is your own headache. Buhari himself was elected as candidate by voting in 2014 at Teslim Balogun Stadium. He was in contention with Atiku and Kwankwaso. That time, I was a member of the BOT of APC and we did our best. We though Nigeria will change for the better, we never knew that the cabal would come and surround Buhari and be dictating the shots.\n\nCould you now say that APC is good to go especially with the new NWC?\n\nAPC has better candidates than the PDP, but the two parties have similar ideological leanings which is why it is easy for people to move from one party to the other. PDP too has good people. With a good leader from both parties, a lot of things will change. You can see what Tinubu and Fashola did in Lagos.\n\nIs that suggesting that you have preference for Tinubu as an APC candidate?\n\nTinubu is my friend, he is capable. The only thing is that it\u2019s long I saw him and I wouldn\u2019t know if his health can carry the burden of leadership. If he feels his health is good enough for it, then he is good to go.\n\nThe PDP appears to be at a loss on the issue of power shift to the South. How do you see the ongoing power play in the party especially with the gladiators in the North already in the race?\n\nIt is all greed. How can you have Buhari as Hausa/Fulani for eight years and then give power to the North again? Is there any sense in that? Nigeria is on a tripod and even with the minority as the fourth leg. The argument the PDP is putting up is a very stupid one. They are saying that Southerners have ruled more in PDP than the Northerners. What of 30-something years when the military was there? Babangida was there for eight years, have they forgotten that? Buhari was there as military head of state for two years, they have also forgotten that. Murtala Muhammed was there for six months, they have forgotten all that because Obasanjo ruled for eight years. My stand is that Nigeria is multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural and we should all respect that. Atiku has been contesting elections for decades. He is a good man, but he should allow other people to contest. They should leave it for the South. Both APC and PDP should pick their candidates from the South. We can\u2019t allow Hausa/Fulani to be there forever. What about the other people? What about the people of the Niger Delta who are suffering environmental degradation as a result of oil exploration? Nigeria has not developed to a level where we neglect ethic consideration. Nigeria is not a homogeneous nation. We should not pretend to be. There must be some considerations and sacrifices to make the country move forward.\n\nIt\u2019s like the party is afraid of the likes of Atiku who will not just let go?\n\nLet them go ahead to destroy their party. There are many good people from the North in the PDP just as there are good people in the South. Presenting a Northern candidate against the South will be like a war. It shouldn\u2019t be like that.",

          "text": "\n\n\u2022 As 21 are reported missing by relatives\n\n\n\nKasim Sumaina in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Saturday confirmed the safety of 170 passengers, even as it said that 21 passengers were still reported missing by the relatives who made calls to the corporation.\n\nNRC, in a release in Abuja by its Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, read: \u201cYou would recall that on the 28th of March, 2022, suspected bandits attacked the last evening train, AK9 on the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna Train Service with explosives, leading to the death of some passengers and destruction of the train and track.\n\n\u201cBecause of the level of damage on the track and in honour of those that lost their lives, the Corporation suspended train operations on the affected route.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okhiria, while in this mournful mood, it is also important to inform members of the public and the press about the latest development and what the corporation is doing to restore train services.\n\n\u201cThis update has become absolutely necessary so as to prevent the circulation of falsehood or misleading information to the general public.\n\n\u201cFor the records, there were eleven (11) coaches on the train worked by Loco 2502, which is made up of four (4) SPA Coaches with 56 sitting capacity per coach and 7 SP Coaches with 88 sitting capacity per coach.\n\n\u201cThus, the total seat capacity of the train is 840 seats. You may also recall that the train manifest contained 362 validated passengers aboard the train.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss hinted that the corporation, in continuation of its concerted effort through repeated calls, has been able to confirm the safety of \u201c170 passengers, while 21 passengers are reported missing by the relatives who made calls to us,\u201d Okhiria said.\n\nHe further said that the corporation is seriously collaborating with the security agencies who had already swung into action, in line with the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything possible to rescue all those that are still missing.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe corporation is also not resting on its oars as she has heavily moved human and material resources to the accident site to make sure that train services resumed without further delays in order to reduce the stress that our passengers are currently going through.\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, a high powered restoration team, led by directors have been working round the clock to re-rail the coaches affected by the bomb blast.\n\n\u201cThere is a co-ordinated two-pronged simultaneous restoration approach. While Loco 2702 with re-railment and restoration materials departed Idu Station, Abuja to the bomb blast site, another team with Loco 2502 departed Rigasa Station, Kaduna with re-railment and restoration materials to the same site.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that as at the close of work on the 1st of April 2022, Coaches SP00004, SP00009, SP00012, SP00013 have all been re-railed and safely taken to our Rigasa Station in Kaduna. Restoration of track for full resumption of normal train services will continue today 2nd April 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said further in the statement, \u201cGentlemen of the press, it may also interest you to know that arrangements have equally been put in place for increased security along the track and on board the train to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cOnce again, our hearts go out to the families of those that lost their loved ones and that of those that are still missing.\u201d\n\nHe however assured Nigerians that the corporation is with the general public in this challenging time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Friday in Abuja updated President Muhammadu Buhari on security developments in his state following the Monday night\u2019s terror attack on Abuja-Kaduna bound train.\n\nThe governor, who was sober about recent happenings in his state, told State House correspondents that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in Kaduna state and beyond.\n\nAccording to him, security agencies have been making frantic efforts to rescue victims of Monday night\u2019s attack on a Kaduna bound train, from the hands of their abductors.\n\nHe disclosed that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in the state and beyond.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i, who spoke in Hausa language, disclosed that the attack on the train was carried out by Boko Haram iinsurgents in collaboration with some bandits operating in Kaduna, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto and Kebbi States.\n\n\u201cThe President assured me that necessary steps would be taken on the matter and this thing will be brought to an end in few months, and security agents are already carrying out surveillance around where these criminals are and, by the grace of God, they will be rounded up.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, the government will always take precautionary measures to safeguard the lives of citizens, therefore, except the victims are rescued unhurt, the airforce and ground troops will not be able to confront the criminals. So to avoid any colossal damage, the captives have to be freed first,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor confirmed that the gunmen had contacted families of their captives, but yet to request for ransom.\n\n\u201cWell, the families of those kidnapped have been contacted while some of the captives themselves have called their loved ones, saying they are doing well and they are being taken care of. But the gunmen have not shown any sign of collecting ransom,\u201d he added..\n\nEl-Rufai emphasised that the gunmen are not kidnappers but members of the Boko Haram terrorists group working in collaboration with bandits.\n\n\u201cThese ones are not the usual kidnappers but members of Boko who are collaborating with bandits.\n\n\u201dSo we were thinking they will ask for a huge ransom from the state government, not the families of their victims.\n\n\u201dSo far, they have asked for ransom from just one of the families that were contacted.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Kaduna state government is concerned, we have not changed our stand on payment of ransom, so, even if they seek for that from us, we will not pay because we are not ready to do so,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i revealed that the state government had received intelligence report that the gunmen were going to strike on the rail line and had intimated the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) on the matter, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cWe think this thing happened because we have written twice to the NRC, advising that trains on the Kaduna route should not embark on night trips because we have reports that Boko Haram were in town and they plan to attack the train at night using explosive devices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for massive bombing of all bandit-infected enclaves including forest areas in the North West and North Central parts of the country.\n\nNAN recalls that the Kaduna-bound train, which left Abuja at 6 p.m. on Monday, was attacked by suspected terrorists at about 7.45 p.m., just about 15 minutes\u2019 drive before Kaduna.\n\nEight persons had been officially confirmed dead, 46 hospitalised and several others kidnapped following the attack.

The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd). They accused the security agencies of profiting from the increasing insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, House Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, accused the government of failing to live up to expectations. Ado-Doguwa suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms in self-defence.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, decried some of the public words of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. The main opposition party said such words tended to confirm its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts as well as plans of the terrorists, and deliberately refused to act.\n\n\n\nThe air interdiction came as troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) killed scores of insurgents during a clash in the Lake Chad area.\n\nNigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial deliveries, to aid the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n\nA military update issued in Abuja, yesterday, said 34 terrorists were decimated in waves of air strikes.\n\nThe update said, \u201cIn receiving credible information that at about 2.pm on 30 March 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu-Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro Village, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike swiftly scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. Feedback from local sources around Mangoro Village, disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorist were recovered.\u201d\n\nA source said some of the terrorists fled with multiple gunshot wounds during the encounter, but it was still unclear what roles they played in the attack that killed eight passengers onboard the Kaduna-bound train, with many injured and undetermined number abducted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an emergency intelligence meeting coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency after the train attack identified three locations as \u201cdestinations\u201d of bandits after most attacks within the axis.\n\nThe meeting, according to PRNigeria, also considered immediate deployment of integrated security surveillance and monitoring solutions for the rail line.\n\n\n\nThe locations identified by the intelligence service as bandit dens are in Rijana, Katari and Kasarami.\n\nThe places have proximity to the Kaduna-Abuja highway and rail lines.\n\n\u201cThese locations are abodes to kidnappers, armed bandits, drug addicts, gun runners, prostitutes and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d a senior intelligence source revealed.\n\nThe officer further disclosed that a \u201cmassive joint security operation\u201d would commence in the areas, simultaneously with the support of recently acquired drones.\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cSome of the services have recently acquired sophisticated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the drones to improve surveillance and ensure precisions on attacks on targets.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate collateral damages in the initial stages of the operation, even though we will ensure maximum protection of innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cProper identification exercises of people in the areas would be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe meeting of the intelligence operatives was on the heels of a security parley between President Muhammadu Buhari and the service chiefs.\n\n\n\nBuhari had given the service chiefs the marching order to find lasting solutions to the incessant attacks on motorists and train passengers by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nPrior to their meeting with Buhari, the duo of Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, and Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruq Yahaya, undertook an assessment visit to the scene of the attack.\n\n\n\nIn another development, troops of the MNJTF, Operation Hadin Kai, eliminated scores of fighters of terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the on-going clearance operations around Lake Chad region.\n\nSecurity sources said troops successfully cleared Cemente, Bagadaza, Zanari and Wulgo in Gamborun Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\n\n\nA source said, \u201cThere were two encounters with the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents at Zanari and also at the harbour area. Troops were decisive in both attacks.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the troops also rescued 21 women, 11 male children and nine female children in the operations, which commenced on March 28, 2022.\n\n\n\nSome of the items recovered in the aftermath of the encounter included two gun trucks, 22 bicycles, 18 motorcycles (destroyed in situ), two Rockets Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes, three Rockets Propelled Grenade Bombs, one NBST Gun, two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), three GPMG belts, 600 rounds of 7.62 MM NATO, and one FN Rifle magazine, among others.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial delivery.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surv. Abudulganiyu Adeyemi Adebomehin, the Chief of Intelligence of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Abubakar Liman, said the purpose of his visit was to seek areas of further collaboration with OSGoF, because of its expertise, skills and data required to aid NAF in its operations.\n\n\n\nHe solicited synergy with relevant authorities especially, in the war against insecurity, stating that, \u201csecurity is everyone\u2019s business. War is a national assignment,\u201d which required the support of every citizen.\n\nThe intelligence chief reiterated the significance of the role of OSGoF in the war against criminality in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his response, Adebomehin said OSGoF, an extra-ministerial establishment of the federal government as the apex mapping arm and responsible for implementing the survey coordination act of the country, was ready to provide all resources at its disposal for the success of the operations of NAF and other arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He disclosed that his office produced navigational charts for the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), which was certified by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). He added that OSGoF had acquired more sophisticated equipment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as a digital printing outfit.\n\n\n\nAdebomehin stressed that the surveyors and other staff were already undergoing series of training and retraining in readiness to provide geo-spatial needs of the government, its MDAs, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOutraged Lawmakers Say Nowhere is Safe in Nigeria\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives, yesterday, expressed concerns over the worsening insecurity in the country, lamenting that nowhere is safe in the country anymore. Reacting to the recent attacks by terrorists on Kaduna airport and train, the lawmakers, while debating a motion of urgent national importance on the killings in Giwa, took turns to fault the security agencies and the federal government for their failure to end killings by terrorists and other criminal elements.\n\n\n\nHon. Shehu Balarabe (APC, Kaduna), while moving his motion, lamented that his local government had been ravaged by the series of attacks by bandits, who indulged in killings, kidnapping, raping, robbery and destruction of property. He said between 24 and 28 of March, bandits had unleashed attacks on those communities, killing over 117 people, while some corpses were yet to be recovered.\n\nThe lawmaker also claimed that more than 136 people were abducted, while over 10, 463 others had been displaced from their homes.\n\n\n\nContributing, Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) called for suspension of funds appropriated for security agencies until they showed what they had achieved with what had been released to them over the years.\n\nMajority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms to defend themselves. He said, \u201cI arise to speak in the capacity of the Majority Leader, who of course, is the ambassador of government on this floor. When you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government, especially, a democratic one which was elected by the people is to ensure safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis, those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but we continue day in, day out \u2013 killings, massacre, armed robbery all over \u2013 left, right and centre. Government in this case has to rise up to its responsibility, call a spade, a spade.\n\n\u201cOn account of this institutional failure, regimental failure on the part of our security agencies, because you have just no cause to raise excuse, funding is provided, here we are now as an institution, we have now sent invitation, come and meet with the people of Nigeria, come and interface with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, I think Nigerians should this moment be allowed to also take arms. Nigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard earned properties, because it is like a monumental failure, if the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failure.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet Nigerian organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let\u2019s organise defence for their innocent souls, because if the responsibility of the government cannot be carried out democratically, then, everyone has the cause to defend himself. Nigerians should no longer be running away from attacks, unnecessary bandits.\u201d\n\nAhmed Jaha (APC, Borno) was of the view that security matter in Nigeria has become a cash cow business, accusing security agencies of profiting from it.\n\n\n\nJaha said, \u201cIn 2021, we budgeted N460 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only N29 billion was for capital expenditure, the remaining was for recurrent expenditure. In 2022, we budgeted N571 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only 37 billion is capital expenditure, the remaining were recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr speaker the truth of the matter is security in Nigeria has become a cash cow business. I am not willing to go without taking my own and he is not willing to go without taking his own and the other person is not willing to leave until when he got his own.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a cash cow business. They don\u2019t want it to finish, because they will realise that everybody\u2019s attention was diverted towards north-east. Okay, let them release north-east to some extent and go to north-west, after north-west, they move to south-west. Before you realise what is happening, the whole country is gutted with security challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after being chided by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, he withdrew his comment and said he was not going to deal with him.\n\nBut Hon. Nasiru Ali Ahmed (APC, Kano) called for the sack or resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), for failing to curb insecurity in the country. Ahmed recalled when the service chiefs were sacked and IG of Police changed, adding that no one was indispensable.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSince 2015, the inspector general of police, service chiefs have been changed. But the NSA has not been changed. The Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser. From what I heard, most of these criminals were 16, 18 years old boys. Are we saying that the Nigerian Army, police, DSS, Air Force with all the training that they have had, all the international training, they have gone for peacekeeping.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre they now saying these 18 years old boys are more powerful than them? You travel by road, you are kidnapped; you go by train, you are kidnapped; you sit at home, you\u2019re kidnapped. So, where are we going to stay. You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. I\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed. He has been there for seven years, what has happened?\u201d\n\nWase, who presided over the session, however, disagreed with Ahmed, saying, calling for the sack of NSA might not be the solution to the issue. He noted that despite President Muhammadu Buhari changing the service chiefs, nothing has changed to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nWhile blaming the judiciary for not prosecuting arrested culprits, he assured the people that the parliament would continue their investigative duties and anyone found wanting would not be spared, suggesting that activities for the day be suspended and prayers offered in solidarity with the lives lost to insecurity across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, urged the federal government to implement recommendations contained in the House security summit, held last year.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos), told THISDAY that his committee and other security committees of the House would engage with the heads of the various services with a view to thoroughly and effectively analysing the incident (and other similar occurrences), proffering and implementing lasting and sustainable solutions.\n\n\n\nBenson said, \u201cThe recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is yet another sad and regrettable security breach. As a committee, we are saddened and highly disturbed by the incident and the brazen audacity of the bandits. We believe that Nigerians should enjoy adequate security everywhere they go. We, therefore, see this as a major setback that must be addressed immediately, especially, considering the current fear of traveling by road along that route.\u201d\n\nHouse Beams Searchlight on Own Security Committees\n\nThe House of Representatives resolved to look into the activities of its standing committees on security, to see how effectively they were carrying out their oversight functions on the security agencies.\n\n\n\nThe committees included Navy, Army, Air Force, Defence, Interior and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nContributing to a motion on the recent killings in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, noted that a lot needed to be done to stem the tide of insecurity. He wondered if one report had ever been turned in by the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence. I don\u2019t know,\u201d mandating the relevant security committees of the House to step up their oversight functions as well as conclude the reports of their investigations.\n\n\n\nChief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno, frowned on the slow pace with which the Committee on National Security and Intelligence carried out assignments.\n\n\n\nMonguno said, \u201cWith regard to the committee, I can also recall that the first bill that was passed for second reading is my bill, which is the bill on small arms and light weapons. That bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report. Up to the extent that they had to go and appeal to Mr Speaker, which he had to set up an ad hoc committee. That is the extent the committee has not performed.\u201d\n\nPDP: El-Rufai, Amaechi\u2019s Confessions Confirm APC\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said the public utterances by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, confirmed its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts and plans of the terrorists ravaging the nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\nPDP also said the comments by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council (FEC) frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirmed that the APC administration had been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country.\n\n\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said in exposing the APC government, which he was a part of, el-Rufai said, \u201cWe know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP said that in his own confession, the Minister of Transportation said, \u201cWe knew what the problems would be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment\u2026I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost\u2026 When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying\u201d.\n\n\n\nPDP, therefore, said, \u201cThese revelation from high-ranking APC public officials, who are in the position to know, is troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari insists on retaining a self-confessed terrorist apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, to continue to head the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which is indispensable in any meaningful fight against terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nPolice Defuse Another IED in Kaduna\n\nAnother Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted in Rigasa area of Kaduna was defused by the Nigeria Police yesterday.\n\nThe bomb, the police said, was planted a few kilometres to the Train Station.\n\nOn March 26, 2022, four people were injured in an explosion planted in Danmani community in Rigasa area.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Mohammed Jalige, said the latest IED was planted in the area by yet to be identified persons.\n\nHe said the IED was sighted by residents of the area about 07:50 hours and they promptly reported to the police.\n\n\u201cIn a swift response, the Command\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) swung into action and successful defused the IED, without any loss of lives or property.\n\n\u201cThe acting Commissioner of Police DCP Maiyaki Baba, thanks the residents of the area for their vigilance and prompt reporting of the incidence and assures them that the command will always prioritise the safety of the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement advised members of the public to always report suspicious movement or persons in their communities, noting that such information would be treated in full confidentiality.\n\nHe, however, said normalcy had since been restored in the area and residents were going about their normal business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has debunked reports that motorists were stranded along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, when terrorists barricaded the road.\n\nIn a statement, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the reports were not true.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route. The buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts, who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road. The troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the government would update members of the public whenever more detailed feedback was received.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government does not deny the existence of security challenges and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nThe market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) gained N3.02 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, notwithstanding the growing insecurity concerns in the country.\n\n\n\nThe market performance was buoyed by impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that saw some of them delivering robust dividend payout to shareholders.\n\n\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation gained N3.02 trillion to close on March 31, 2022, at N25.312 trillion, higher than the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, also rose by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nData compiled by THISDAY revealed that the sectoral performance of the NGX was bullish, as most indices closed the period on uptrend as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the NGX Oil & Gas Index appreciated the most by 28.12 per cent. It was closely followed by the NGX Banking Index, which recorded a gain of 8.55 per cent, while the NGX Premium Board Index rose by 6.34 per cent.\n\nOthers were the NGX Pension, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX 30, and NGX Lotus II that went up by 6.34 per cent, 5.63 per cent, 5.39 per cent, 4.37 per cent, and 1.18 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods recorded year-to-date decline of 6.35 per cent and 4.21 per cent respectively, as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nOn a monthly review, the Nigerian bourse witnessed positive price movements leading to a bull-run throughout January 2020, during which it closed with a 9.1 per cent month-on-month growth in the All-Share Index, and extended the gains by 1.7 per cent in February. During the period, BUA Foods got listed, boosting the market capitalisation by N720 billion.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the market performance in Q1 2022, Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the stock market sustained positive sentiment and uptrend due to the influx of corporate actions and 2021 audited financials, as players reacted to the released numbers and dividend declared for year-end 2021 earnings.\n\n\n\nOmordion said that was expected to support an uptrend during the earnings season, amid the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis resulted in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks, as 2021 Q4 GDP was up at 3.98 per cent, while the International Monetary Fund called for a hike in the interest rate and further devaluation of the naira,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn the market outlook, Omordion projected mixed sentiment trading by investors in April and beyond, saying all eyes would be on the performance of the economy and how the country\u2019s economic managers would navigate challenges, which included insecurity and activities externally.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, investors would also be concerned about on-going war in Ukraine, energy supply chain distortion that had been one of the major factors driving inflation, insecurity, among other factors that have pushed cost of production, goods and services higher.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cTo invest profitably in this changing environment, you need investment education, trading plans and trading tools/software. These will help manage risk associated with volatility and unstable markets.\u201d\n\nAn analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye, said investors priced in the dividend payout out by the listed companies, which according to him drove market performance.\n\n\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cInvestors have already priced in the dividend in January and February and that is why the market maintained positive growth during the period. However, there was profit-taking in March as most investors did not bother to wait for the dividend payment date.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that in April, the stock market might witness cautious investors\u2019 trading due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The government said 26 persons were injured during the attack while eight bodies were recovered and several persons missing.\n\nOn Saturday, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) confirmed the safety of 170 passengers who boarded the attacked train, adding 21 passengers were missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid the reactions that trailed the incident, some reports claimed that the Obi of Onitsha was meant to be among the passengers that boarded the train but a phone call about an emergency reportedly saved him from doing so.\n\nReacting to the report, the palace of the Anambra monarch, in a statement on Saturday, said Achebe did not make the statements credited to him.\n\nThe palace said the monarch, scheduled to deliver a lecture on Tuesday, March 29, at the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna, opted for road transportation with adequate security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile His Majesty was abroad, the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State, sent a letter dated 21 January 2022 inviting him to deliver a lecture on Tuesday, 29 March 2022 to its annual training programme of officers from all security agencies in the country on internal security,\u201d the palace said.\n\n\u201cHis Majesty, on return to Onitsha on 08 February, accepted the invitation in keeping with his commitment, along with his brother traditional rulers, to the promotion of peace and harmony in the country.\n\n\u201cIn discussing the options for His Majesty\u2019s travel to Jaji with his hosts on 14 March, the option of travel by train from Abuja to Kaduna was considered and set aside in favour of road transport with adequate security escort.\n\n\u201cThus, His Majesty travelled safely to Jaji on 28 March and returned to Abuja on 30 March with very adequate security escort provided by the AFCSC, and no hitches whatsoever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, 31 March, His Majesty attended the South East Leadership Press Conference at Enugu. In his brief goodwill message, he lamented the state of insecurity and violence in the country and drew attention to the train attack in which the Onitsha kingdom lost the young medical doctor, Chinelo Megafu.\n\n\u201cIt was in that connection that His Majesty mentioned casually that the option of his travelling by train to Kaduna on that date had long been set aside in favour of road travel by mutual agreement with his hosts. No reference was made to any imaginary phone call from anyone. This has been His Majesty\u2019s only public reference to the tragic train attack of 28 March.\n\n\u201cThe news media were present at the Enugu meeting and one of them would be the likely source of the false and convoluted story claiming that His Majesty made the said statement on Saturday, 02 April 2022.\n\n\u201cIndeed, His Majesty was mostly engaged today with the Anambra peace meeting organised jointly by the new Anambra State Government of Mr. Governor, Professor Chukwuma Charles Soludo and the Joint Body of the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the Archbishops/Bishops of the South East on Peace and Conflict Resolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOther than delivering the keynote press statement of the occasion, His Majesty did not engage the media on any subject whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is in dire straits on internal security, and anyone could be a victim in the situation that we currently face, for instance, the unfortunate victims of the train attack.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Itimi: From Nigeria to the UK in search of peace",
          "text": "Peace Itimi has spent 9 months away from Nigeria but doesn\u2019t miss the country. She misses her cleaner and cook, though, because, in London, she doesn\u2019t have a cleaner and cook. But she at least has peace of mind.\n\nWhen Itimi started working remotely from Nigeria, she promised herself she would stay in Nigeria, until the Lekki toll gate killing\u2014where tens of #EndSARS protesters, who were protesting against police brutality, were killed\u2014scared her out of her wits. \u201cI felt unsafe,\u201d she recalled. It was then she started to reconsider her stance on immigration and realised money won\u2019t shield her from how unsafe Nigeria was increasingly becoming.\n\nA friend gave her the nudge to leave the country, recommending that she go through the Tech Nation Visa\u2014a visa that allows tech talent across the world to live and work in the UK\u2014because, he felt, she was a good fit. In 2021, she started researching the programme, and even though she felt the requirements were scary, she realised that everything she had done up until that point made her a perfect fit.\n\nFinding different loves\n\nItimi grew up in Benin City, Edo state, and studied medical biochemistry at Delta State University. She fell in love with digital marketing while in university. She said university had been one of the most definitive phases of her life because it was where she found God, found herself, and digital marketing.\n\nWhen she became a Google Student Ambassador, she started training other students in digital marketing in school. Fresh from school, she launched a digital marketing agency with a friend in 2016.\n\nShe moved to Lagos in February 2017 to begin her national service year at digital marketing agency, Webcoupers, and that was where she officially launched her career. In 2018, she joined Wild Fusion, another digital marketing agency, where she trained people on digital marketing, branding, Google Ads, and SEO. She, in that same year, also organised training on behalf of Facebook, Orange Academy, and the British Council.\n\nDuring one of her travels for digital marketing training in Accra, she realised that even though she loved travelling, her physical reach was limited. \u201cI can\u2019t train people in Accra except when I travel to Accra. So, I started thinking that a way to break that divide was to start training people online and that means I can reach anybody anywhere, so long as they can find my content.\u201d\n\nSo, Itimi started a YouTube channel in December 2018 where she initially shared marketing tips and random lessons about life, before launching a now-popular segment called Founders Connect, where she has interviewed about 40 African founders, including Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Atsu Davoh of Bitsika, and Ezra Olubi of Paystack.\n\nIn 2019, she entered the Nigerian tech ecosystem after landing a role as the Head of Marketing at fintech company, Korapay, before moving to Venture Capital (VC) firm, Seedstars in 2020.\n\nFirst comes loneliness\n\nIn the first few months after Itimi arrived in the UK last June, she felt lonely. She had never been so far away from home before; the farthest she had travelled had been within the continent, to Cape Verde, in 2019.\n\nEverything was new to her in the UK. For example, the summer was warm yet she still felt cold. She couldn\u2019t see clearly and had migraines when she went outside without sunshades. It also took her a while to adjust to the predominant use of contactless payment in London.\n\nAs an introvert, making friends was initially difficult for her, even though she didn\u2019t face this difficulty back home. In Lagos, she was mildly popular so people started conversations with her at events. Now in the UK, she decided to become more intentional about making friends and connecting with people by starting conversations. When she sees someone on social media she wants to connect with, she reaches out and asks them to have a coffee or jump on an informal call with her. \u201cI am learning that a new environment and country requires an improved me. I have to do extra work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what this means for her is that she has to move past her introverted nature and social anxiety because to live the life she wants she must connect with people, build a network, and make impact in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, she made more friends when she joined a cycling community of about 20 other immigrants and her friends for whom she had reviewed the Tech Nation Visa applications joined her in the UK. On top of that, on the back of her YouTube video where she shared her experience with the visa application, at least 20 people have reached out to tell her they had got the visa.\n\nLondon, the good and the bad\n\nShe currently works remotely as Head of Growth for offline fintech app, Stax and admits that her productivity has increased since she moved. \u201cI don\u2019t apologise for bad internet anymore. I don\u2019t have to worry about electricity, either. I can afford to leave my laptop unplugged.\u201d\n\nItimi is excited about the travelling opportunities London presents; she feels more confident applying for visas for different countries now than she ever was in Nigeria. London has the most connected flights anywhere in the world and they are relatively cheaper.\n\n\u201cWhen I travelled to Kenya from London, in February, my flight cost less than a flight from Lagos to Kenya.\u201d\n\nOne thing Itimi likes about London is its diversity\u2014in people, food, and even the hobbies she can choose from. She is also in love with its efficient transport infrastructure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exceed the time I estimate to get to my destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this exposure to working infrastructure and this level of diversity is doing something to my mind that I will be grateful for in a couple of years because of how I would have grown as a person.\u201d\n\nShe also loves the feeling of freedom in the city, which allows people to be themselves. \u201cFor instance, I feel like my confidence in the way I dress has increased a lot since I moved to London, compared to when I was in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t like the weather. During the winter, she rarely left her house, and when she did, her multiple layers of clothing didn\u2019t stop the cold from getting to her and the wind from threatening to blow her over. She looks forward to the summer, which she prefers.\n\nMaybe higher up on the list of things she doesn\u2019t like are taxes, because there are a lot of them. \u201cI feel like if I thought too much about my taxes I probably would not have moved when I did; I would have waited a bit longer to save more money in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years on, what has #YouTubeBlack Voices done for African creators?",
          "text": "When TNC Africa, a Nigerian television production company, wanted to launch long-form video content that tells original African stories to the world, it chose YouTube as its medium. It was evident that YouTube could provide a platform that would connect it to the world and provide sufficient data for analytics on its audience. \u201cBeing an early-stage startup where data is super important, and one that does a lot of data analytics, we needed a platform where we could get access to that data, and YouTube offered that, \u201c Olawale Adetula, co-founder of TNC Africa said.\n\nAdetula explained that YouTube has the largest share of the video-watching audience it is targeting in Africa, such that even android phones have the app pre-installed.\n\nWhile YouTube aims to provide a platform for creators globally to explore their creativity, in 2020, it shined a special focus on Africa when it launched the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund. The $100 million Fund\u2014created by YouTube as a response to the racial injustice that characterised 2020\u2014is a 3-year initiative dedicated to spotlighting and growing black creators on YouTube, from across the world, by providing them with funding, resources, and mentorship that will help them thrive on the platform.\n\nThe Fund, in the past 2 years, has worked closely with African content creators, musical artists, and, recently, producers and songwriters, offering them seed funding to develop their channels, training focused on upgrading their production, community engagement and wellbeing skills as well as workshops and networking programmes to help them grow their channels.\n\nAdetula\u2019s biggest takeaway from the Fund is the opportunity to network with and form relationships with over 135 other top creators around the world. The Fund\u2019s structure, which encourages every creator to work with another creator, plays a role in ensuring that these relationships are formed; and has translated into upcoming collaborations for TNC Africa, too.\n\nTNC Africa\u2019s target audience has also broadened beyond Africa as a result of the programme. \u201cWe were creating content and targeting viewers within Africa or with African interest because we never thought our content could be appealing to non-Africans. Today, the number of viewers we are getting from the UK, US, Ireland, and South America is steadily increasing since we implemented some of the things we learnt from the YouTube Black Voices Fund.\u201d More people outside Nigeria are getting interested in content created by Nigerian YouTubers.According to data made available to TechCabal by YouTube, over 75% of watch time on content produced by channels in Nigeria comes from outside Nigeria.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s inaugural cohort last year featured a Creator Class of 20 content creators, from Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. Its Artist Class featured 3 African artists: Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol, South Africa\u2019s Soma Jozi, and Nigeria\u2019s Fireboy\u2014who have gone on to use the platform to connect with their fans.\n\nFireboy\u2019s \u201cPeru\u201d remix with pop star, Ed Sheeran, has gone global, with the song topping music charts across the world. During his time on the programme, on YouTube, he performed a live stream concert to over 83,000 fans who watched the virtual performance, to celebrate Africa Month.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices helped award-winning Kenyan Afro-pop group Sauti Sol become the first Kenyan act to be included on a Times Square billboard in New York.\n\nKenyan Afro-pop band, Sauti Sol, perform their Midnight Train album in a virtual concert that has raked over a million views on YouTube. Addy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa, YouTube, spoke about Sauti Sol\u2019s excitement when the Fund put their pictures on billboards in New York, Los Angeles and London. \u201cIt was a great Kenya-to-the-world story. They were already celebrated in Kenya; it was amazing to be a part of their success and help them break out of Kenya.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures made available to TechCabal by YouTube, in Kenya, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in Kenyan shillings) has increased by over 60%, year over year. While over 400 channels have at least 100 thousand subscribers\u2014an increase of over 70%, year over year\u20146 channels have over 1 million subscribers; and 1 channel has over 1 billion views. Over 45% of watch time on content produced by channels in Kenya comes from outside of Kenya.\n\nWhile the inaugural class had 20 creators and 3 artists from Africa, for the 2022 class, YouTube increased the number to 26 content creators and 4 artists; while creating a new class, for producers and songwriters, a development the Fund said demonstrates its continued support for artists on the platform.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices placed Nigerian artist CKay on a billboard in Los Angeles\n\nA member of the newly-created songwriters and producers class is Nigeria\u2019s brilliant 20-year-old producer, P.Priime, who has produced hits for some of the biggest names in Nigeria\u2019s music industry, including Wizkid, Fireboy, and Olamide. He further blew up this year after it became known that he produced Nigerian artist Asa\u2019s album (except for one song).\n\nP.Priime had heard about the Artist Class but originally didn\u2019t know there was going to be a category for producers, so he was excited when he heard about the newly introduced class. \u201cI was excited that people were starting to recognise the work producers do. I feel we are finally getting our flowers, and people are starting to see our importance beyond working with artists,\u201d P.Priime told TechCabal.\n\nWhen P.Priime joined the programme, they helped him organise his channel, and he started sharing his process\u2014with his video where he took his fans through the making of Nigerian artist Reekado Bank\u2019s hit \u201cOzumba Mbadiwe\u201d raking 63,000 views.\n\nThe Fund helped him get new equipment and has provided him with an opportunity to connect with artists across the world. Although his YouTube channel is monetised, he said he is not all about the money: \u201cIt is giving a piece of P.Priime to my audience, documenting my work process and using the opportunity to reach new audiences even when I am not dropping new music.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the challenges that African YouTubers face, Awofisayo blamed the late delivery of Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)\u2014which allows them to monetise their YouTube channel\u2014on African YouTube creators\u2019 countries\u2019 bad postal services. Awofisayo further explained that the reason YouTube sends the PIN via postal service is to prevent identity theft and circumvent fraud.\n\nAwofisayo said that the #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund was created to encourage black creators and artists to get on YouTube, amplify their voices, and create an opportunity for them to be successful on the platform. But she revealed that beneficiaries of the Fund do not get preferential treatment or get prioritised on the platform.\n\nAwofisayo revealed that the selection of newer and early-stage creators\u2014creators that have been on the platform for a few years\u2014is a shift from last year when most beneficiaries were established content creators. Awofisayo said YouTube wants to also empower more creators like Nigeria\u2019s Mark Angel, who has built a production company out of his YouTube channel. \u201cIn the long run, we want to make sure that black creators, not just those in the fund, are able to be successful on our platform, and that our platform is an enabler to their creative success,\u201d she said.\n\nNigerian content creator, Tomike Adeoye, a member of the 2022 class of creators made an Instagram post where she expressed gratitude to YouTube for its support and the BlackVoices Fund for providing funds. \u201cThank you for #YouTubeBlack. Thank you for being a great source of income! Just seeing us and doing what we love, we see the dollars flow in our account monthly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn Nigeria, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in naira) is also up by over 60%, year over year, with over 650 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 50%, year over year. Still in Nigeria, 35 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of 50%, year over year.\n\nIn South Africa, the percentage of YouTube channels making 6 figures or more in revenue (in rands) is up over 40%, year over year, with over 300 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 60%, year over year. Still, in South Africa, 25 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of over 30%, year over year. Over 65% of watch time on content produced by channels in South Africa comes from outside of South Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor African football fans, the weekend is not just a time to take a break from the hustle; it is also time for battle. They watch TV screens intently, fuming, cheering, and cajoling as their teams in the various European leagues battle on the pitch.\n\nHowever, some fans now look forward to the footballing weekend for more than just the love of their teams. The love for the game is now shared with the passion for fantasy football or football betting.\n\nFantasy sports in Africa isn\u2019t much of a thing. Sports betting, however, is quite popular. In a survey conducted by GeoPoll in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, 72% of respondents had participated in betting, 53% of which was football betting.\n\nWhile fantasy sports in Africa might be a fantasy (pun intended), compared to sports betting, it is big in other regions. And though they might appear similar because they involve gambling, they are done differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of betting on real-life football teams, fantasy football involves gambling on virtual teams created by the player-manager. The teams created will include virtual forms of real-life footballers.\n\nThe virtual team manager earns points in the game based on the actual performances of their players.\n\nIn the English Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football League (FPL), the managers get \u00a3100 million ($130.8 million) to buy 15 players from different clubs. They are only allowed to buy three players from a single club. As in real-life, players differ in price based on their performances.\n\nSome other European leagues have a fantasy version of their leagues, with the Fantasy Liga and Fantasy Bundesliga owned by the Spanish and German leagues, respectively.\n\nAccording to football magazine FourFourTwo, FPL has eight million players globally who compete to be the Jose Mourinho of fantasy football.\n\n$3 million to make fantasy football mainstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eksab team. Source: Supplied\n\nOn Monday, March 28, 2022, Eksab, an Egyptian fantasy football startup, announced that it had raised $3 million from investors to scale its platform. The round was led by 4DX Ventures, with participation from Golden Palm Investments, Darwazah Capital, P1 Ventures, and angel investors.\n\nFounded in 2018, the startup\u2019s first offering is a prediction game where users create a fantasy lineup with a leaderboard showing their progress. Users who predict correctly are eligible for prizes.\n\nWith over 700,000 users on its platform, the startup reports that its paying users have increased 60% month on month. Although the startup\u2019s current focus is on football, it plans to get into other sports soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving betting companies a run for their money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the world, startups are capitalising on the almost religious following that sports enjoys with fantasy football offerings. Investors are also not holding back, as seen in French startup, Sorare\u2019s $680 million Series B round.\n\nIn Africa, though, betting companies are capitalising on the following that sports, particularly football, enjoys on the continent. According to Business Day, Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, spends \u20a62 billion ($4.9 million) on sports betting daily.\n\nIntervals between games are frequently littered with ads from betting companies. And some of the biggest platforms have signed up former players as ambassadors in Nigeria. However, Eksab\u2019s raise could be the beginning of fierce competition between sports betting companies and fantasy football platforms.\n\nA few factors have contributed to fantasy sports\u2019 growth. The first is that players compete against each other rather than against the bookie. Consequently, a player\u2019s result largely depends on their skill level. On the face of it, this looks positive, but it also means that unskilled players do not stand a chance against top players.\n\nThe second is the low entry barrier. Most fantasy sports sites do not require players to pay before playing. On the other hand, users need money to participate in sports betting. As a result, more people can easily join fantasy sports platforms.\n\nWhile fantasy sports seems like an evenly matched competitor for sports betting platforms, the market share of betting companies could see them add fantasy sports to their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

This week has been a mixed one for Nigerians, especially for residents of Kaduna. First, terrorists attacked the state\u2019s lone airport; then, a train carrying over 900 passengers was attacked, with some passengers killed or kidnapped.\n\nThe Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s men\u2019s team, drew a World Cup qualifying game in the same week, ensuring that the country will be absent when football\u2019s biggest tournament kicks off in November.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t all sad. 18 of the 24 countries that made up Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch are based in Nigeria, proving that investors and founders see massive potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were appearances from countries like Sudan, Namibia, and Uganda, and we discussed all that on the Techpoint Africa podcast. You can listen using your preferred podcast providers.\n\nToday\u2019s Techpoint Digest discusses waste management in Africa, Tushop\u2019s pre-seed, Khazna\u2019s Series A, and Techpoint Pitch Friday. We also have a roundup of opportunities in African tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nManaging waste with tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, while on a work break, I went to get some food with Ogheneruemu. Like many eateries in Nigeria, our food was packed in plastic plates. After eating, she remarked, \u201cthese guys need a recycling plan ASAP.\u201d\n\nWaste landfills are a common sight in many African countries, but you would also find waste dumped into gutters and canals. About 2.1 billion tonnes of waste is produced each year globally, with reports stating Africa had about 125 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to grow to 244 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nShe spoke to Damilola Kadiri, Founder of Wura, and Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO\u2019s Founder, about their experiences building businesses that tackle waste management in Africa using tech.\n\nMeet two Nigerian companies using technology to change how we reuse waste\n\nGrocery shopping with the community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is one of the most common explanations for human motivation. At the lowest level are physiological needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood is probably the most critical physiological need in Africa, and not just because we need it to stay alive. Its importance can be seen during elections when politicians frequently share food during campaigns.\n\nAs food costs rise worldwide, Africa is one of the hardest-hit regions with high food inflation, meaning that its residents spend as much as 40% of their income on food alone. That figure is 56.65% in Nigeria, while Kenyans spend 36% of their income on food.\n\nWhile the best way to mitigate these problems would be to produce and preserve more food, that requires significant investments. However, Kenyan startup, Tushop, uses community group buying to help Kenyans save on food.\n\nHow does community group buying work? Someone \u2014 usually called a community leader \u2014 aggregates orders from individuals who live close to each other. It is then relayed to the vendor, farmer, or distributor, after which it is delivered to the community leader. This community leader then unpacks the orders and delivers them to those who made them.\n\nMost Africans are familiar with this, and some offices in Nigeria even operate a similar model where they buy groceries for the Christmas holidays. Now, Tushop wants to use technology to make this available to more people and has announced a $3 million pre-seed round.\n\nAided by the coronavirus pandemic, group buying has grown in popularity in China and India. In this round, Tushop has received backing from 4DX Ventures, JAM Fund, Breyer Capital, Chandaria Capital, TO Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, FirstCheck Africa, DFS Lab, Wasoko. Other investors include Raja Kaul, President Sundial Group; Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO; Eli Pollak, Apollo Agriculture CEO; and Ida Mannoh, Director of Growth, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds raised to grow its team, improve its tech while expanding across Nairobi with its sights set on expanding to other Kenyan cities. Last week on the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we spoke about white founders in Kenya, so it\u2019s interesting to see a black female founder from Kenya today.\n\nKhazna\u2019s plans for financial inclusion in Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve come across an African fintech startup, I would have enough to take three months off and watch my favourite football team play. I promise I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m not.\n\nSo who\u2019s in the news today? Khazna, an Egyptian super app. The Cairo-based startup has announced a $38 million Series A split between debt and equity.\n\nSome of the investors involved in this round include Speedinvest, Algebra Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, Disruptech, Khawarizmi Ventures, and Nclude \u2014 the VC fund launched by some Egyptian banks. By the way, I\u2019ve observed that many African startups are increasingly favouring debt financing.\n\nWhat does Khazna do? Putting Khazna in a box might be difficult. While the startup offers financial services, it also has other non-financial services.\n\nHowever, the startup launched with Khazna HR, a salary-on-demand service that enables partner employers to offer partial discounts to their employees before payday.\n\nThe startup is not the only one playing in that field, with Earnipay and Cadana as some of its competitors in the African market.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s unending lamentation over insecurity",
          "text": "On April 27, 2021, Smart Adeyemi, a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and senator representing Kogi West constituency at the Senate, wept on the floor of the Senate while speaking on the worsening security situation in the country.\n\nAdeyemi had said that it was no longer time to keep quiet. He urged his colleagues to take drastic action by calling President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s attention to a menace that he noted was threatening the lives of every citizen.\n\nIf the observation made by the senator was taken seriously, Nigeria would have been saved from the killing field the country has converted into by terrorists that operate as though there were no government.\n\nSince the senator made the lamentation, many more Nigerians have lost their lives to the activities of herdsmen, bandits, Boko Haram insurgents and kidnappers that have effectively taken over the country.\n\nWithin the period that the senator raised the alarm, the House of Representatives of the National Assembly had held a security summit that was attended by the high and mighty in Nigeria. It ended up as a talk show. Nothing, as usual, was achieved.\n\nThe same last year, Buhari pleaded with the United States of America to move Africom headquarters from Germany to Africa.\n\nThe House of Representatives told the President to declare a state of emergency on the security sector. A number of National Assembly members lamented the worsening security situation in Nigeria.\n\nSenator Ike Ekweremadu said the government has lost legitimacy\n\nOn a daily basis, Nigerians are being killed like chicken under the watch of an elected government; the only reaction is endless meetings and rehash of promises. The citizens have since lost hope and faith in government. They have since put their security in the Supreme Being.\n\nThe terrorists\u2019 attacks on Kaduna International Airport, killing one Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) official, and the blowing up of the rail line resulting in the derailment of the Abuja-Kaduna bound train last Monday are indications that Nigeria is indeed in an unconventional war without end in sight.\n\nUp till now, it has become a gaze work, how many people that died, injured or kidnapped as a result of the attack. The manifest that is making the rounds on social media does not add up.\n\nWhereas reports had it that about 970 persons were on board the train, the manifest shows that less than 400 passengers boarded the ill-fated train. Was it a case of deliberate less documentation of actual passengers to dupe the government or outright oversight? That has also opened a new chapter of fraud or corruption that may be going on in that sector.\n\nIn October 2019, the United Nations reopened its building in Abuja, eight years after the property was destroyed in an attack by a Boko Haram suicide bomber.\n\nThough the Nigerian government undertook the rebuilding of the property and handed it over to UN officials, sadly the government has never kept to its promise of forestalling further bombings and violent attacks across the country.\n\nToday, the situation is getting worse on an alarming rate as dreaded bandits and other criminal elements have joined forces with Boko Haram in the ceaseless assault on Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWhile 23 UN staff were killed in the August 21, 2011 suicide bombing, 73 others injured, Nigeria has witnessed more gruesome killings since then, with at least over 5,000 deaths annually in the past 10 years, according to a UN report.\n\nMoreover, at least 35,000 people have been killed in northern Nigeria with at least 2.2 million internally displaced persons in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, since 2009 when Boko Haram launched its insurgency aimed at overthrowing Nigeria\u2019s secular government and establishing an Islamic state, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect.\n\nSadly, the lamentation seems endless for the citizens as the Nigerian government has proven incompetent at handling the situation.\n\nThe most worrisome for many is that at every attack by bandits or Boko Haram, and no matter the number of casualties, government\u2019s response has always been same; exhibition of weakness, living in self-denial and reeling of unfulfilled promises of fighting terrorism.\n\nThe latest attack on the train has further exposed the weakness of government over terrorists, and most importantly, queried the huge amount being budgeted and spent daily on security.\n\nIn a tweet following the Kaduna train attack, Senator Shehu Sani, said: \u201cWhen I told them that about Abuja-Kaduna road, they antagonised and fought us. Now, N4.27trillion was spent on Defence in 7 years, yet terrorists with AK-47 on bikes have become invincible.\u201d\n\nLamenting from a victim\u2019s corner, Sarah Bulus, a civil servant who lost her husband to bandit attack in Kaduna in January this year, decried that Nigeria can salvage the situation, but because of sectional interest, the government is looking the other way while terrorists are having a field day; unleashing mayhem unchallenged.\n\n\u201cWho is going to challenge bandits or Boko Haram when government has interest or may be sponsoring them, the terrorists cannot overpower our army, it is just that the government does not want the army to flush them out because of their vested interest\u201d, the widow said.\n\nWhile joining her voice to other widows and families of victims of the ceaseless attacks by the bandits in the North East, Sarah, an aggrieved Kaduna State indigene, expressed her disappointment over the failure of the leadership of the country to stand up to its responsibility of protecting lives of the people that it swore an oath to serve and corruption across the military, which has reduced the once-feared Nigerian Army to puppet.\n\nTrailing a more serious path, Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, questioned the efforts of his former colleagues at fighting insecurity.\n\nAccording to him, the Nigerian military has all it takes to defeat the bandits and Boko Harama within six months; hence it is disappointing that insecurity is escalating despite ample time given to the military, huge sums spent and other incentives that are not made public.\n\n\u201cTruly, it is sad to hear that bandits or Boko Haram are still on rampage when all the things the Nigerian military has asked for are being provided. Bulk of government\u2019s budget now goes to security, even the Kaduna State governor was quoting billions he has spent on security, yet the terrorists seem to be winning the war. The military should look inwards and challenge itself. It can even go beyond the government to get results, which they did during the ECOMOG days. Yes we can, yes the Nigerian military can,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the boldness of the bandits worries many.\n\nMitchel Onyechere, an Abuja-based businessman who uses the Abuja-Kaduna rail route, queries how over 200 bandits will enter an airport without being noticed, as well as disregarding the security architecture of the airport.\n\n\u201cIt means our security operatives, including the Army mean nothing to bandits, probably because of their superior weapons, what happens to the huge funds spent on updating our ammunitions, what about the fighter jets acquired late last year, are they meant to kill peaceful protesters when the terrorists are having a field day here and government is not saying or doing anything different,\u201d Onyechere noted.\n\nAlso citing the Kaduna Airport attack, Ibrahim Mansur, a foreign news agency correspondent in Abuja, said that the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) is just a stone throw from the airport, yet the bandits dared attack.\n\nMansur, a Lebanese born in Nigeria, argued that if the terrorists could attack the NDA in August 2021, it means even the Presidential Villa is not safe.\n\n\u201cI think the government should learn from countries that have fought terrorism to a standstill. It should collaborate and show commitment at fighting genuinely as some countries who are willing to partner in the fight may be scared the government may not give all to the fight\u201d, he said.\n\nOnyechere also sees more challenges for businesses in the Kano-Kaduna-Abuja corridor as movement is being hampered because of the high level of insecurity on rail, road and air in the region.\n\n\u201cMy business partners in Kaduna are moving their operations to Abuja for now, some airlines have stopped flying into Kaduna and the rail is stopped now. But should these be happening when an ex-general is in power. I recalled the ruling party saying it will tackle insecurity in matter of months, today they are almost ending their second term in office and more terror is being unleashed, more lives lost, properties gone, and investments also. Who is deceiving who,\u201d he lamented.\n\nFor Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian researcher based in Belgium, the answer to the insecurity challenge in Nigeria lies with the government.\n\nFor him, countries of the world, investors and foreigners will not take the country seriously because of the less regard for the lives of her citizens and inability to defeat home-groomed terrorists.\n\n\u201cYou cannot reinvent the wheel, all government needs to do is to be sincere in the fight against terrorism. In my opinion, the government has never been serious and the fight is not all about spending huge funds on ammunition, take care of the soldiers, raise their morale, prosecute corrupt military officers and those sabotaging the fight, and then invite foreign partners who will be willing to come, seeing your sincerity of purpose\u201d, he admonished.\n\nHe also thinks that the failure of the government to protect the lives and properties of the citizens, which it was elected to do, should be enough ground to change the leadership for better at the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cFor me, Nigerians should insist on change in 2023 and it should be people who have capacity to effect change, to protect and better their lives. I have family back in Nigeria and I know the level of hardship in the country. That should be enough to say no to vote buyers and vote in credible people, which I don\u2019t see in any of the two major parties. Nigerians should for once be stubborn at choosing their leader in 2023, a leader that can stand terrorists and cabals to restore the country\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d he further said.\n\nNo day ever passes without report of attacks, killings, kidnapping of Nigerians and foreign nationals by terrorist groups across the country.\n\nThere are continuous attacks and killings in Benue State, where the situation has degenerated in the last few years. Separate attacks on communities in different Local Government Areas of the state by suspected armed Fulani herdsmen, leading to death of thousands, with a large number of people displaced.\n\nRead also: Nigerian leaders, no more \u2018April Fool\u2019 for the citizenry\n\nJust last week, a Deeper Life Church Pastor, John Ajav and three others were reportedly killed in separate attacks on communities in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State by suspected armed Fulani herdsmen; it was one in a series of daily attacks on helpless people in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Pastor was shot and killed at Waku village while on his way to a church programme in Gbajimba from the Umenge community. It is again a sad day for us in Guma. These terrorists have continued to attack and kill our people for no reason whatsoever,\u201d Tivlumun Nyitse, Chief of Staff to the Benue State Governor, said.\n\nInterestingly, in several of these attacks and killings, President Buhari has always said that his administration was on top of the situation and would end the killings sooner or later. However, for now, such promises appear to be a mirage.\n\nIn April 2021, suspected terrorists killed at least 83 persons and displaced hundreds of others, including women and children, in attacks on many villages in Zamfara.\n\nThe President, in a reaction to the incident via a statement by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu in Abuja, said that the persistent violence against innocent people must stop.\n\n\u201cThese criminals should stop pushing their luck too far by believing that the government lacks the capacity to crush them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not give these criminals any opportunity to succeed by taking the war to their own camps and stop them in their tracks before they even have the time to respond under our massive fire power,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari directed the military, security and intelligence agencies to take immediate steps to close all existing gaps in their operations being exploited by criminals to wreak havoc.\n\nDespite several of these promises, the attacks and killings of innocent Nigerians have worsened across Nigeria.\n\nMany Nigerians have blamed President Buhari and his administration for not doing enough to halt the spate of attacks, killings. Some wondered why the President has failed to apply the same zeal he used in crushing the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and arrest of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu to curtail the frightening security Nigeria situation.\n\nChristopher Imumolen, aspirant for 2023 presidential election on the platform of the Accord Party (AP), bemoaned the state of the nation and worsening spate of insecurity across Nigeria and called for drastic measures to be taken to avert further loss of lives.\n\nHe noted that road, rail and air transportation have now high risk for travelers.\n\n\u201cIt is not new anymore that the nation is under attack. There is a need for concerned Nigerians like me to speak up. You can see that the security of Nigeria is in a mess, the state of Kaduna State is nothing to write home about.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer safe; we can no longer travel through the road, through the rail and I\u2019m beginning to ask myself; how do we get to this situation?\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further he said: \u201cThis situation is a result of the lackadaisical attitude and incompetence of those who currently lead us and it is high time Nigerians began to speak the truth, because we need to revive this country.\n\n\u201cIf one thousand men can be kidnapped, many killed and nobody knows where they are at this point, it means the country is not safe.\n\n\u201cWe are in a time where the President, governors, vice president should not be sleeping, because war has been declared on this nation, we are under attack.\u201d\n\nObservers have suggested that the security agencies need to work on intelligence gathering and information analysis so as to be proactive rather than to be reactive in their approach.\n\nSimilarly, many stakeholders across the country have also stressed the need for community policing and the need for locals to be engaged in the security architecture of this country. They say it is high time the vigilante groups be resuscitated to enhance security across Nigeria.\n\nKunle Okunola, public affairs analyst, said the security agencies most especially the DSS, NIA and the Army need to extend their investigation into politics and fish out those sponsoring the insecurity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is only an insane individual that would not know that the spate of insecurity in Nigeria is dangerous to our peaceful co-existence as a nation.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity challenge facing the country can never let Nigeria reach a greater height. The fear of the unknown would never allow foreign direct investment (FDI) into the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the Buhari administration needs to wake up and act fast in mitigating the insecurity of lives and property in this country. Fundamentally, the security of lives and property is the major responsibility of a government but alas, the reverse is the case in Nigeria,\u201d Okunola said.",

          "title": "2023: What Adamu\u2019s emergence means for Tinubu\u2019s ambition",
          "text": "2023: What Adamu\u2019s emergence means for Tinubu\u2019s ambition\n\nINIOBONG IWOK (LAGOS), JAMES KWEN (ABUJA) AND CHURCHILL OKORO (BENIN)\n\nThe emergence of Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has elicited a lot of permutations on the political scene, particularly in relation to the presidential ambition of Bola Tinubu.\n\nThere is the belief in some quarters that the APC, having Adamu, a Moslem from the North-central, would look towards having a Christian presidential candidate from the Southern region of the country.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who say that Adamu and Tinubu have a cordial relationship cemented by their era as governors from 1999 to 2007, and may not want to lose the grip on power despite clamour for generational power shift.\n\nSome observers say that as far as the battle for the APC presidential ticket is concerned, the Asiwaju of Lagos is ahead of many contenders, having made it clear that he is prepared for it, hence, being \u201ca lifelong ambition.\u201d\n\nTo demonstrate his seriousness, Tinubu was the first to approach President Muhammadu Buhari to tell him that he wanted to succeed him in 2023.\n\nThough David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State also visited Buhari for the same purpose, Tinubu went beyond that having had consultations with traditional rulers and other critical stakeholders.\n\nThe APC\u2019s National leader is also the first presidential aspirant to parley the National Assembly Caucus of his party where he solicited their support and explained why it must be him.\n\nAt the meeting with the House of Representatives Caucus, Tinubu said he was one of the best products the party can sell in the upcoming general election as the other aspirants are not stable.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost people have nothing to offer but questions and creating doubt. I am not here to be defensive. I am here to tell you that I am one of the best products that you can sell. I am the only one in the race that is most competent, most qualified to be your president come year 2023.\n\n\u201cI am the only one who has been through the tutelage of the National Assembly. I am the only one who has consistently been in one party. The others are not stable. Some of them are rolling stones.\u201d\n\nHowever, under the Adamu-led APC, Tinubu may have obstacles to his ambition if APC decides to do \u201creligious balancing\u201d as it did in 2015 when his vice presidential bid was thwarted by the rejection of a Moslem/Moslem ticket (Buhari/Tinubu).\n\nThere have been agitations for a Southern Christian President in 2023 as the incumbent, a Northern Moslem bows out on May 29 next year.\n\nA group called, Nigeria Equity Group (NEG), had recently called for a President of Christian faith for the country in 2023 when it supported the position of the Southern Governors that the country\u2019s next President should come from South.\n\nEmeka Nwosu, chairman of the group, had said in the spirit of fairness and equity, Nigeria\u2019s next president should be a Christian from the South, especially as President Muhammadu Buhari \u2013 a Muslim from the North \u2013 will finish his two-term of eight years by 2023.\n\n\u201cWe wish to note and state clearly that the call for a Southern presidency in 2023 by the Southern Governors did not go far enough. We strongly believe that the only way to truly promote fairness and inclusion in our diverse and complex society, especially at this time of unprecedented national crisis, is for a power shift to a Southern Christian in 2023,\u201d Nwosu had said.\n\nA Chieftain of the party, who did not want his name in print, said APC, being a listening party, decided to zone its National Chairman to the North and gave it to a Moslem to pave way for the emergence of a Christian Southerner.\n\n\u201cThe party wants to satisfy the cacophony of voices demanding for a Christian Southern President; that\u2019s why it has not only zoned the National Chairman to North-central but ensure a Moslem emerged through consensus.\n\n\u201cThis will however, affect the ambition of our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu because being a Moslem, the party will not want to have both National Chairman and presidential candidate from the same faith for religious balancing,\u201d the party stalwart said.\n\nBut another ranking member of the party also, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the APC presidential ticket may not be given on the basis of religion, citing the era of former President Olusegun Obasanjo who was a Christian but most National Chairmen of his party were of the same faith with him.\n\nThe APC Chieftain also said Tinubu\u2019s chances were still bright under Adamu as they were contemporaries who may have to protect their interest common.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think APC presidential ticket is all about religion. Remember, Obasanjo was a Christian and many PDP Chairmen were from the same religion. Don\u2019t forget also the bond that governors share both serving and former ones. The two (Adamu and Tinubu) belong to that group; if you like, call it cult- where members\u2019 interest is paramount,\u201d the source said.\n\nA member of the party who spoke to BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he was going to shock Nigerians; now he has single-handedly installed Senator Adamu as the party chairman; be sure that he is going to anoint somebody nobody expected to emerge as APC candidate.\u201d\n\nAccording to the party man from North Central, \u201cAdamu is a Moslem; it may be difficult to have a Moslem presidential candidate from the South. It is a dicey situation and many people are in for a shocker very soon.\u201d\n\nHe also recalled that President Buhari had enjoined the new National Working Committee (NWC) members to promote internal democracy and equal opportunities and ensure that party primaries are not influenced by \u201chighest bidders\u201d going into the 2023 general election.\n\nPolitical actors in Edo State told our correspondent that the allegiance of the new helmsman will be to the party and not to anyone.\n\nGodwin Erhahon, pioneer state publicity secretary, Edo State chapter of the party told BusinessDay in Benin that the focus of the newly-elected chairman, Adamu, would be to stand for the party and unite them ahead of the general election.\n\nAccording to him, Adamu will be more of the people\u2019s chairman than a cabal chairman.\n\n\u201cHe will be a bridge builder that will ensure there is no crack in the party from the likes of pro-Buhari and pro-Tinubu. He will stand for the party and do all he can to unite everyone.\n\n\u201cMy first agenda for him is to bring on board his rivals in the chairmanship race, undertake visits to the various states of the federation as well as have a talk with the grassroots leadership of the party,\u201d Erhahon said.\n\nSpeaking on what it means for the Ex-PDP member to lead the APC, the former chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) said: \u201cNo man who has left an old party for a new one would want the party he has left to succeed over the one he went to. Having left PDP for APC, if he now helps PDP to succeed, then he would have belittled himself.\n\n\u201cThe first thing to do is for him to tell PDP that without him they will go nowhere. He has to ensure that APC wins. I believe he will work assiduously in APC than he did in his former party.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Bola Tinubu\u2019s chances under the present APC leadership, Tony Abolo, a Benin-based communication expert said \u201csince he is regarded as someone who can play the game, I think, he has a good chance under Adamu or anybody.\n\n\u201cTinubu is fixated on his ambition and I don\u2019t think he is bothered to look at who had emerged as the APC chairman because there seems to be an agenda somewhere. Tinubu\u2019s chances have nothing to do with Adamu. But I think he will fight for the race irrespective of who leads the party.\u201d\n\nAbolo, however, said that Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, looks likely to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cYou can see that Buhari is playing the game while other aspirants are moving up and down. I think the anointed candidate of the President is Rotimi Amaechi, he seems more favored and that\u2019s why he was turbaned by the Emir of Daura, Umar Faruk. While Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State may be his vice president,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu emerged the APC chairman despite having seemingly unending cases with the nation\u2019s number one anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe party had allocated the position of national chairman to the North-central geopolitical zone, based on a general framework that North and South would swap the national party offices they currently hold.\n\nBut with Adamu officially assuming office by receiving instruments of office from the immediate-past interim chairman of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mala Buni, at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja Wednesday, the APC can now shift focus on the enormous task of retaining power in 2023.\n\nThe newly elected national chairman acknowledged the task ahead of him and other elected National Working Committee (NWC) executives, upon assumption of office when he said that members of the NWC and party members across the country must work round the clock for the APC to be successful in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPeople are talking; APC does not have an incumbent on the ticket. We will have the honor of the integrity and the legacy of the current president on the ticket.\n\n\u201cWe will work day and night. We have less than 12 months to face the general election. So, everybody should buckle up. The little I have heard about the President is that he has a complete allergy for failure. So, failure will not be in APC from today. We will work for success together. To my colleagues, if there is any issue, don\u2019t begrudge me, let me know.\u201d\n\nFor now, it is not yet clear what the emergence of Adamu as the national chairman of the APC means for the presidential aspiration of Tinubu.\n\nThough it is obvious that Adamu was not Tinubu\u2019s preferred candidate for the chairmanship position but had to bow to the President\u2019s decision.\n\nObservers say that it is part of the plan to cut Tinubu\u2019s influence in the ruling party which would ultimately affect his chances of emerging as the party\u2019s candidate in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nRead also: Tinubu vs Osinbajo: Yoruba Obas are wrong to take sides on 2023\n\nSome pundits have however, said that Adamu\u2019s emergence was not a threat to the presidential bid of Tinubu in 2023, because the former Lagos State governor still had his structures in place across the country and equally had his men in the new NWC of the party.\n\n\u201cWell, you may say that Adamu may not be Tinubu\u2019s man because he is expected to be loyal to whoever put him there. But I can tell you that Tinubu knows this game more than anybody. Don\u2019t forget that even the secretary and some men in the NWC are from the South West.\n\n\u201cHis structure is there in the Southwest and across the North, where he has been building bridges. He always has his way of master strategy. I think he is more than serious with this presidential ambition,\u201d political analyst, Wale Oti said.\n\nSegun James, another pundit, has predicted that just like what transpired at the national convention; the APC may decide to adopt consensus arrangement to choose its presidential candidate, purposely to water down the chances of Tinubu emerging victorious in the primaries.\n\nHe further said that such a decision could lead to serious implosion in the APC that could be disastrous for the party in 2023.\n\n\u201cAdamu is not Tinubu\u2019s man; he was supposed to be the President\u2019s man. But if you look at the APC\u2019s coming presidential primary, Tinubu may have a chance if they allow delegates to vote and elect the party candidate, but would they allow that?\n\n\u201cThey may want a consensus presidential candidate again, and once the President does that, there may be a problem again. If that happens there may also be issues again, serious implosion I can tell you.\n\n\u201cSo, that may be the end of the party, because Tinubu and his loyalists may leave the APC, because once the Southwest leaves, the party is gone. The votes of the North alone can\u2019t give them president and APC does not exist in the South East; forget what they are saying there.\u201d",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nAfrica Finance Corporation (AFC), has defied harsh operating environment occasioned by Covid and commodity-driven headwinds to deliver record performance in its latest full-year earnings.\n\nAccording to the financials issued at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Lagos on Friday, the Corporation saw its annual profits increase by 26.6% to US$209.7 million in 2021, passing the US$200 million mark for the first time in its 15-year history, from US$165.5 million in 2020. Total assets rose by 16.3% to a record US$8.56 billion.\n\nThe statement noted that the dramatic increase can be attributed to investments in high impact assets in targeted sectors across Africa and its strong credit profile.\n\nThe Corporation leveraged on its investment-grade credit rating and reputation to mobilise finance from international markets to help reduce Africa\u2019s infrastructure deficit.\n\n\u201cThis has been a year of solid progress in our core objectives of building value to Africa\u2019s economies through instrumental infrastructure driving growth and job creation,\u201d said Samaila Zubairu, President and CEO of AFC.\n\n\u201cAs the proverb goes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second-best time is today. We have proven over our 15-year history that you can successfully build a track record in infrastructure investment in Africa\u2014and there has never been a better time to do so.\u201d\n\nAddressing a press conference after the AGM, Zubairu revealed that the Corporation had invested about $1.6 billion in Nigeria, adding that it is presently partnering with the federal government in building a rail line to Niger.\n\nHe disclosed that AFC has launched a $2billion facility to help countries in serious need of liquidity to recover from the shocks of the pandemic.\n\nAFC\u2019s reach on the continent is now larger than it has ever been, with investments expanding to 35 countries and cumulative disbursements rising by 14% to US$9.9 billion (2020: US$8.7 billion). AFC increased Member States by five to 33, with the accession of Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Morocco and Niger.\n\nAmong projects during 2021, AFC invested US$150 million for the development of cashew and cotton integrated industrial parks in Benin and Togo; provided a US$200 million corporate facility to BUA Industries Limited for the construction of a sugar refinery and ethanol plant in Nigeria; and invested US$175 million in the Baomahun Gold Project in Sierra Leone.\n\nAFC Capital Partners (ACP) opened as an independent asset management business and launched its first product, the Infrastructure Climate Resilient Fund, with a target to raise US$500 million in 12 months and US$2 billion over the next three years for investment in robust energy, transport, buildings and other infrastructure.\n\nThe past year also saw AFC successfully launch two new products through the Syndications unit \u2013 the A/B Bond and Credit Insured B Loans \u2013 both of which will significantly deepen capacity to channel capital from global investment markets into the African continent.\n\nThe Corporation continued to diversify funding, with a 21.5% boost to borrowing year-on-year at US$6.19 billion (2020: US$5.09 billion). AFC successfully accessed the global debt markets by issuing US$1.8 billion in new loans and bonds during the year. This included:\n\nEstablished in 2007 to catalyse private sector-led infrastructure investment across Africa, AFC is the second highest investment grade rated multilateral financial institution in Africa.\n\nIts approach combines specialist industry expertise with a focus on financial and technical advisory, project structuring, project development and risk capital to address Africa\u2019s infrastructure development needs and drive sustainable economic growth.",

This was the highest national case count since the early days of the pandemic in February 2020.\n\nChina is also battling a large outbreak in the northeastern province of Jilin.\n\nSent to Shanghai by the central government, Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan urged the city on Saturday to \u201cmake resolute and swift moves\u201d to curb the pandemic.\n\nGROWING ANGER\n\nStories of how Shanghai separates COVID-positive children from their parents have gone viral in the country and triggered widespread public anger. read more\n\nSome have also demanded clarity over the testing regime, after a recorded phone call, reportedly between a Shanghai health official and a resident, was widely shared on Chinese social media.\n\nShanghai health officials said on Saturday they were investigating the case, in which the resident said his father had tested negative, according to his personal health app, but was told he was positive and had to be centrally quarantined.\n\nIn a rare instance of grassroots lobbying, several residents reposted a statement on the WeChat and Weibo social media platforms saying they wanted asymptomatic or mild cases to be allowed to isolate at home, after reports of unsanitary and crowded conditions at quarantine facilities.\n\nJane Polubotko, a Ukrainian marketing manager quarantining at the Shanghai New International Expo Center, told Reuters there were no showers at the facility and she had only seen people with light symptoms, such as sneezes and coughs.\n\nSupply chains and businesses are also being tested.\n\nRiver congestion for containers and oil tankers off Shanghai has been easing since Thursday, but the number of bulkers queuing in outer Yangtze estuary anchorage jumped to nearly 90, the most since early October, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nNearby ports, such as Ningbo in Zhejiang province, are experiencing an acute surge in waiting vessels waiting, as companies divert cargos to avoid prolonged logistics turnarounds.\n\nStill\uff0csome are hoping that lockdowns could start to ease soon.\n\nTesla Inc (TSLA.O) hopes to resume production at its Shanghai factory on Monday, two people familiar with the matter said, as it expects to see its first batch of workers released from lockdown.",

          "title": "Soyinka: Omisore\u2019s Election as APC National Secretary Has Crippled Probe of Bola Ige\u2019s Murder",
          "text": "Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, on Saturday faulted the decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to elect Senator Iyiola Omisore, as its National Secretary.\n\nSoyinka described Omisore as \u201cone of the prime suspects\u201d in the murder of a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Chief Bola Ige.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, the Nobel laureate said Omisore\u2019s election has \u201chamstrung\u201d the investigation into Ige\u2019s death.\n\nThe Nobel laureate wondered why President Muhammadu Buhari anointed Omisore as the party\u2019s scribe after he (the president) responded to his demand to re-open Ige\u2019s unresolved murder at the 20th anniversary of the tragic incident.\n\nHe raised diverse questions on Buhari\u2019s commitment to resolving the murder case after he had ordered the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba to re-open the case files and resume the investigation.\n\nIge, also a former governor of old Oyo State, was gruesomely murdered on December 23, 2001, by yet-to-be-identified assailants in his Solemilia Court located at No 8, Akinlabi Sanda Close, Bodija in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHis murder triggered the sudden death of his wife, Justice Atinuke Ige.\n\nOmisore, the then Deputy Governor of Osun State, was fingered in the murder of the late AGF as the prime suspect, having been entangled in the protracted internal crisis that plagued the defunct Alliance for Democracy (AD).\n\nIge, Omisore and his former principal, Chief Bisi Akande, were deeply involved in the party\u2019s crisis.\n\nIge\u2019s assassination was linked to an altercation that happened at the palace of Ooni of Ife, the late Oba Sijuwade Okunade during the conferment of chieftaincy title on some personalities.\n\nIn December 2002, Omisore was impeached as the Deputy Governor of Osun State over breach of oath of office and other offences.\n\nAfter his impeachment, Omisore was arrested and detained over Ige\u2019s murder but he repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nHe was however, discharged and acquitted in June 2004 by an Ibadan High Court, which cited \u201ccontradictions and inconsistencies\u201d as well as insufficient evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case.\n\nOmisore, a former senator, was adopted as the APC National Secretary at the party\u2019s last national convention in Abuja.\n\nLamenting what he described as an unusual turn of events, Soyinka, in his statement yesterday, said these events had raised questions because the ruling party had just elected as its National Secretary one of the prime suspects of the most notorious of the nation\u2019s unsolved murders.\n\nHe said: \u201cNot for a moment does one suggest that mere accusation, even trial, presumes guilt. More than a mere verdict is involved in any trial, however.\n\n\u201cThe process of arriving at that ultimate destination \u2013 justice \u2013 is integral to the very concept of democracy and equality under the law. That process is one of the structures of civic education.\n\n\u201cUnresolved till today were quite some untidy, even suspect aspects of the investigation, prosecution and trials, aspects, which revealed improper cell co-habitation by suspects under custody.\n\n\u201cThat this led necessarily to recantations of earlier depositions is not thereby proven, but the fact remains that such U-turns did take place. One was so brazen that it induced a heart attack that proved fatal to the victim\u2019s wife, another Justice \u2013 Mrs Atinuke Ige.\n\n\u201cThat the prime suspect was privileged in some improper ways went beyond mere allegation. Political interventions, including pressure on the judiciary during bail hearings, cannot be denied. A judge under such pressure kept a diary with accusations, pages of which he consigned to friends for safekeeping.\u201d\n\nExplaining what Omisore\u2019s emergence means to re-opening Ige\u2019s murder case, Soyinka said the resumption of an investigation into the murder case was already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility with the emergence of a prime suspect in the case as the National Secretary of the ruling APC.\n\nWith Omisore\u2019s emergence as the APC National Secretary, Soyinka rhetorically asked: \u201cIs the Inspector-General of Police equipped to confront political obstacles in a resumption of investigation?\n\n\u201cIs there any guarantee that the result will see the light of day? How suspect, ab initio, will be the conclusions, given the present political ordering? To this layman, that investigative revisit is already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility.\n\n\u201cI think the nation should simply relieve President Buhari of his pledge. I am certain the Inspector-General of Police will be equally relieved and can now turn his mind and energy to the national accustomed posture \u2013 business as usual.\u201d\n\nSoyinka wondered what happened to Buhari\u2019s pledge to re-open an enquiry into the country\u2019s spate of political murders in response to his demand at the 20th anniversary of Ige\u2019s murder.\n\nHe lamented that barely three months had passed since the 20th anniversary of Ige\u2019s murder \u2013 an occasion, which according to him, was used to remind the president of a subsisting election pledge.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat pledge was to re-open the files on the spate of unsolved political assassinations that had plagued the nation in recent decades. Prominent among those cases was that of the Minister of Justice, murdered on his way to take up a prestigious position with the United Nations.\n\n\u201cPresidential response was swift. Buhari ordered the Inspector-General of Police to re-open those files and resume investigations. The nation has patiently awaited even a hint of work in progress.\n\n\u201cMost, I am certain, expect no less than a revaluation of prior investigative efforts. None, to my knowledge, has attempted to rush the Chief of Police and his team into judgment.\n\n\u201cWe all take solace in the knowledge that the wheels of justice grind slowly, but they arrive. Eventually,\u201d Soyinka said in his statement doubting the president\u2019s pledge to resolve Ige\u2019s murder.\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",
