          "title": "Fuel subsidy: NEC considers report today, TUC meets, ASCSN threatens showdown",
          "text": "THE Trade Union Congress will today (Thursday) take a position on the planned removal of the fuel subsidy by the Federal Government.\n\nThe TUC Deputy Secretary, Nuhu Toro, disclosed to The PUNCH in Abuja on Wednesday, that the congress would hold a meeting over the subsidy issue.\n\nToro disclosed this ahead of the National Executive Council\u2019s meeting on Thursday.\n\nNEC consisting of including all 36 governors, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and other federal officials is expected to consider the adoption of a report by its ad hoc committee on fuel subsidy removal and the increase of petrol price to N302 per litre.\n\nOn its part, the TUC deputy secretary said the congress would hold a meeting over the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are having a meeting tomorrow (Thursday). The congress will disclose its decision after that meeting.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with The PUNCH, the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria opposed the plan by the Federal Government to remove the fuel subsidy and increase the pump price.\n\nThe ASCSN President, Tommy Okon, said his association and Nigerians would resist the move.\n\nHe said, \u201cOf course, Nigerians are rest assured that they would be defended by our union; that\u2019s why we are here and that\u2019s why we are saying it is a wrong decision to take at this time when workers wages are still stagnant. No increase, they have not made any provision.\n\n\u201cThe transport system has not been looked into. So, you just wake up and say you are removing fuel subsidy. Where in other climes has this been done? Even when you give the subsidy, is it not the wealthy few that still hijacked it? The fight is not about workers, it is what Nigerians must rise and resist.\u201d\n\nOkon stated that the union had already taken a position on the issue, insisting that \u201cno sane government should at this point of economic harshness decide to impoverish the people.\u201d\n\nThere have been fears of likely fuel price increase since the Minister of Finance and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, announced the plan to remove petrol subsidy last June.\n\nAn online news medium, The Cable, reported on Wednesday that a committee of the National Economic Council had recommended that petrol should be sold at N302 per litre from February when the government would cease to subsidise the petroleum products in the country.\n\nThe report explained that NEC made the recommendations last November. The recommendations were reportedly put forward by the NEC ad-hoc committee interfacing with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the appropriate pricing of PMS in Nigeria.\n\nThe report was said to have been presented by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and the head of the committee.\n\nAccording to the news report, the committee recommended full deregulation of PMS prices by February 2022 \u2014 raising the price by about N130/140 per litre.\n\nIt also recommended that all retailers should post PMS prices at all times on a designated website and smartphone app \u2014 and they are expected to post price changes no earlier than within 15 minutes of the price change.\n\nWith the recommendations, the committee added that the federal government would save N250 billion per month on petrol subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cAt current rates, the PMS subsidy is reducing transfers into the federation by about NGN 250 billion per month, and could, if PMS subsidies are not eliminated, result in deductions of NGN 3 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe large-scale time-limited (six-month) cash transfer proposed as a way of transferring the subsidy \u201cdirectly to the people\u201d would cost N600bn but would by paving the way for the elimination of PMS subsidies, enable the federation to recover N3tn in revenues that would otherwise go to PMS subsidies.\n\n\u201cIf PMS subsidies are eliminated by February 2022, N250 billion in deductions would have been incurred, but the remaining N195 billion in anticipated PMS subsidy deductions could be redirected towards FGN funding of the cash-transfer programme,\u201d The Cable said in its report.\n\nBut the Vice-President\u2019s Spokesman, Laolu Akande, said the discussions were still ongoing and NEC had not yet taken any decision.\n\n\u201cWhile there are indeed ongoing discussions on the issue of fuel subsidy, at no time has NEC made any such resolution,\u201d Akande said on Twitter.\n\nThe Federal Government last year revealed plans to remove fuel subsidy even as governors lamented that the monthly amount spent on subsidy was affecting the revenue that should accrue to states from the Federation Account.\n\nHowever, Senate President Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday said the President told him that he did not order anyone to remove fuel subsidy.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The House of Representatives has mandated its Committees on Justice, Public Petition and Police Affairs to \u201cinvestigate the involvement\u201d of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, in the crisis over the ownership of the land in Magodo GRA Phase 2, Lagos State.\n\nAccording to the resolution of the House at plenary on Wednesday, Malami and Baba are to be investigated over their alleged \u201cattempt to destabilise the peace of Lagos State, scuttle the ongoing settlement process and enforce an illegality.\u201d\n\nThe joint committee is to recommend the \u201cappropriate sanction for any officer found culpable in the illegal enforcement and break down of law and order.\u201d\n\nTwo members of the House from Lagos State, Ademorin Kuye and Rotimi Agunsoye, raised the issue through a motion that was unanimously adopted.\n\nIt was titled \u2018Motion of urgent public importance to investigate the invasion of Magodo GRA Phase 2 by the Nigerian Police under the direction of Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General of the Federation.\u2019\n\nMoving the motion, Kuye said, \u201cResidents Magodo GRA Phase 2, Shangisha, Lagos, woke up on the morning of December 5, 2020, to the sight of hundreds of arm-wielding thugs, stern-looking and fully armed policemen and members of the Shangisha Landlords Association purportedly to execute a judgment.\n\n\u201cThe judgment that was supposedly being enforced was delivered in 2012 by the Supreme Court in Military Governors of Lagos State & Ors Vs. Adebayo Adeyiga & Ors in Appeal No SC/112/2002, wherein the apex court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the High Court delivered on the December 31, 1993 in suit No ID/795/88.\n\n\u201cThe declaratory judgment of the Supreme Court only recognised the judgment creditors as being entitled to the allocation and reallocation of 549 plots of land in Shangisha Village, not possession of any land.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawmakers, several attempts have been made by the Lagos State Government from 2012 to 2015 to settle the matter amicably, making different engagements with the judgment creditors, presenting a proposal for reallocation in the Magodo Residential Scheme within the Badagry area of the state, which some of them accepted.\n\nThe lawmakers said the state government, again in 2016, initiated a settlement to re-allocate Ibeju Lekki Coastal Scheme located in the Ibeju Lekki Area \u201cbut this was rejected by the lead plaintiff, Chief Adebayo Adeyiga, as government continues to dialogue with majority of the judgment creditors to reach a concession towards implementing the judgment.\u201d\n\nKuye said, \u201cThe House is worried that despite the ongoing settlement efforts and the pendency of an interlocutory injunction dated December 1, 2020, before the Court of Appeal seeking an order restraining him and his agents, Chief Adeyiga, purportedly encouraged by the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Inspector-General of Police, stormed the estate with unknown bailiffs and armed security operatives to execute a judgment that was purportedly delivered by Lagos High Court.\n\n\u201cThe House is worried that the execution being presently executed through the Office of the AGF, with the connivance of the IGP, is illegal as only the Lagos State Deputy Sheriff can execute the same and not thugs aided by policemen.\n\n\u201cThe House is more worried that the highhandedness and reckless show of force on December 5, 2021, and January 4, 2022 in Magodo by Chief Adeyiga and his cohorts, in blatant disregard to Order 8 Rule 17 of the Supreme Court Rules 2014 and Section 37 of the Enforcement of Judgment and Order Part III of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, LFN 2004, can lead to loss of lives and properties and ultimately breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThe House is most worried the Attorney-General of the Federation is destabilising Lagos State by using his office to back this illegality as a meddlesome interloper and the instrumentality of state \u2013 the Nigerian Police Force and their illegal court bailiffs \u2013 to scuttle ongoing settlement between the Lagos State Government, Magodo GRA 2 Residents and the judgment creditors.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Godwin Oritse\n\nEFFORTS of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, to rid Nigeria\u2019s territorial waters of piracy has yielded major results as the International Maritime Bureau, IMB, for the first time in three years, reported a sharp drop in pirate attacks in the Gulf of Guinea, GoG,.\n\nThe region which hosts Nigeria\u2019s waters, according to global maritime body\u2019s latest report, recorded 34 incidents of maritime piracy and armed robbery in 2021, a sharp drop from 81 in 2020. The figure represented 58 percent drop in the pirates attacks on vessels in the region.\n\nREAD ALSOBreaking: Reps approve direct and indirect primary clauses in electoral bill\n\nIn the annual piracy report IMB attributed the drop in incidents to increased presence of international naval vessels and cooperation between regional authorities. Michael Howlett, Director of IMB, in the report stated: \u201cThe IMB commends the robust actions of the international navies and regional authorities in the Gulf of Guinea which appear to have positively contributed to the drop in reported incidents and ensuring continued safety to crews and trade.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report urges crews and vessels plying these waters to be cautious as the perpetrators remain violent and risk to crews remains high.\n\n\u201cWhile kidnappings at sea dropped 55 percent in 2021, the Gulf of Guinea continues to account for all kidnapping incidents globally, with 57 crew taken in seven separate incidents,\u201d said the report.\n\nThe decline of piracy incidents in the Gulf of Guinea also led to the overall reduction in reported incidents in 2021 globally, said the report, adding in 2021, the IMB piracy reporting center received 132 incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships across the world, the lowest recorded level since 1994.\n\nDespite the drop in piracy activities, the global maritime body urges coastal states to acknowledge the inherent risk from piracy and armed robbery and robustly address this crime within the waters of their exclusive economic zone.\n\nExperts\u2019 Opinions\n\nReacting to the latest report on security in the GoG, President of the Nigerian Association of Master Mariners, Captain Tajudeen Alao, said that the presence of the foreign navies on the GoG coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic that ravaged the world may have been responsible for the drop in pirate attacks.\n\nAlao also said that the drop was expected and urged the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA to invest more in intelligence gathering as most of the attacks are planned on shore.\n\nSimilarly, President of the Center for Marine Surveyors, Engr Akin Olaniyan, commended the NIMASA and the Nigerian Navy for the Deep Blue initiative, Nigeria\u2019s major maritime security facility.\n\nOlaniyan stated: \u201cI know that there has been a lot of security efforts on the watersways and it is basically deployed by the Navy and NIMASA in tackling this piracy menace.\n\n\u201cThe security platforms that have been put in place, now more than ever, have put more action to their words and the planning they have done.\n\n\u201cI am not a big fan of any of them but let truth be told they have done well and we hope they will sustain this because the safety of the waterways, in the sea is to our benefit.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nBy Ike Uchechukwu \u2013 Calabar\n\nCross River State Commissioner for Grants, Hon. John Ulafor, has asserted that achieving good governance and development should not be left to President Muhammadu Buhari alone, but should be seen as a collective responsibility to serve as dividends of democracy to the people.\n\nHe also posited that effective representation of the people will go a long in reducing crime adding that when the people are properly represented\n\nThe former lawmaker made the assertion in Calabar Wednesday while addressing journalists on his resolve to run for the February 26, 2022, Ogoja/Yala federal constituency bye-elections, in Cross River State.\n\nHis words:\u201d It is a collective responsibility, is not all about President Buhari alone, what part are you playing to contribute your quota as a person or group, to ensure that together we can give our people the development which we yearn for?\n\n\u201cWe have been in this politics for quite some time, we have studied politics there was a problem in the senate, so there is a vacancy, the speaker of the house has declared publicly and INEC has come up with timetable, so the Party has also come up with timetable today, for us to start buying the forms today 18th. And by Monday 24 January, we should submit those forms.\n\n\u201cSo am heading to Abuja to pick my form. I have a pedigree that cannot be contested, I was a former member of the House of Assembly, I am a two-time commissioner, a political philanthropist, a core grassroot person, we have served this state and have particularly, been very Loyal to the leader of the party, his Excellency , my mentor, professor Benedict Ayade.\n\n\u201cSo if he finds me proper to go to the House of representative, I will never disappoint him. And moreso, I am very lucky because I come from an area in Yala where, from time to time now, the Ukele Axis have not benefited at all, we have never gone to the house of representative.\n\nALSO READ: 2003 Ogun governorship election is a bygone \u2015 Osoba\n\n\u201cSo I think this is a great opportunity for us. Ukele must be heard, let me go to Abuja, to do the needful, and ensure that we bring diffidence of Democracy to our state and Ogoja/Yala federal constituency.\n\n\u201cI have been tested severally. As a member of the house of Assembly, I was remarkable there. And as a commissioner, as DG, as this as that, in Cross River State since 1998 till date,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker promised to ensure the availability of social amenities if elected to occupy the Ogoja/Yala federal House of representative seat adding that effective representation will reduce crime.\n\n\u201cIf our people have these simple life amenities, at least the crime will reduce. Everybody will be busy. That is what I am going to bring, and am going to ensure that there will be empowerment that has never been done before.\n\n\u201d I am a grassroots person, I know and feel the pain of those down there. I am not talking about being a Lagos Or Abuja based politician, I grew up from the village and became who I am.\n\n\u201cProfessor Benedict Ayade brought me out and brushed me, into what I am, and am standing very tall, and I think that, and I feel that if given the opportunity, the people of Yala/Ogoja will never regret,\u201d Ulafor said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Eguono Odjegba\n\nThe Area Controller of the Apapa Command of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, Comptroller Ibrahim Malanta, has claimed that non-compliance with import guidelines by importers and traders was the reason for its counter-check operations.\n\nIn the counter-check operations Customs operatives gives clean bill and releases cargo only for another set of operatives to interdict and seize same cargo at a different point.\n\nREAD ALSOBreaking: Reps approve direct and indirect primary clauses in electoral bill\n\nYusuf who was fielding question from journalists after presenting the Command\u2019s performance scorecard for the year ended 2021, took time to explain the unfortunate and controversial operations saying that no matter how much Nigerians frown at it, only increased compliance by importers will lead to the stoppage of counterchecks outside the ports.\n\nHe said, \u201cCustoms release and customs intercepts; well, all these kinds of issues are as a result of lack of compliance. If we are sure of our compliance customs will not stop what customs has already released. The point is that we are not compliant.\n\n\u201cIf you are compliant, you can look anyone who stops you on the road eyeball to eyeball, and tell him you have declared the true content of the cargo and paid the true value. As a Nigerian, nobody should intimidate you, but because you\u2019re not sincere, that is why we are having this problem.\u201d\n\nHe said if compliance is institutionalized by individual importers like corporate importers, there will be far less non-compliance and hence more imports will enjoy cargo fast track clearance scheme, which is otherwise open to every importer, small or big.\n\n\u201cHave you seen any manufacturer or conglomerate who are very much compliant with their declaration been stopped on the road? Never! We have a lot of ways that will assist the system to facilitate trade, particularly when you look at the fast track scheme, which allows cargo to move seamlessly from the ports to the conglomerates, importers warehouses.\n\n\u201cFor those complaining about stoppage of goods on the roads, Customs has layers of control, not only at the seaports. If you go to the border, there are layers of control; if you think you have jumped this one, you will not jump the other one. And this counter controls are yielding positive results, particularly in terms of aiding national security.\n\n\u201cIf you go to federal operations units and look at the statistics of their performance, you will be surprised.\u201d",

Currently Villagers have moved out of Ma\u00dandu, Alabani, Sappaji in Berri Ward; over twenty villages are now empty in Galma/Wamba ward and scanty residents in Ukuru, Igoma, Maruba and Ruka villages in Bobbi Ward.\n\n\u201cCommunities that border Kaduna, Zamfara and Kebbi States located in Mariga LGA namely Galma, Makici, Makogi Na Maforo, Nassarawa, and Kwanan Duci are constantly being attacked by bandits and over 15 persons killed in Bobbi ward of Mariga Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cSome notorious bandits in their numbers operated for hours in five villages on Friday, 14 January 2022, where several cattle were rustled as villagers fled their homes.\n\n\u201cThe bandits first attacked Tungan-Ru\u00e1 village in the morning, later moved to Tungan Maje and also rustled cattle.\n\n\u201cThe same day they attacked Kawo Mashegu where two people were killed, four persons abducted and proceeded to attack Tungan Magaji village where several cattle were also taken away.\n\n\u201cAfter several operations 17 persons were abducted including two persons delivering ransom. The same day Farin Shinge village a few kilometres away from Kontagora town was also attacked and two persons kidnapped,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe lawmaker lamented that \u201cthe bandits are in the habit of burning down villages, burning farms with agricultural produce unharvested, stealing the home stored foods of villages they attack with the danger of those who brave the odds to go to their farms for harvest being killed or kidnapped\u201d, adding that many villagers are now IDPs in places like Bangi, Mangoro and other safer locations with no food or amenities for their livelihoods.\n\nSenator Abdullahi recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered the nation\u2019s Armed Forces for a major military operation in Niger State which has faced continued attacks on its communities by bandits and remnants of Boko Haram terrorists fleeing theatres of war in the Northwestern and Northeastern parts of the country.",

          "text": "We are on the match again, we are looking for Mr President and, throughout this year, it is going to be politics all over. Party politics will peak like it has not in the last few years. Aspirants seeking to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari have started coming out, and more will come out as days become months.\n\nOur country really needs a leader who will both inspire hope and deliver results. I doubt if there is anyone who honestly can say he or she is not troubled by the state of our nation. To the best of my knowledge, there is discontentment in the land. Some have even predicted a bleaker future if something drastic is not done. The economy is struggling, and security challenges are refusing to give way.\n\nNo time but now that we are preparing for another presidential election is appropriate for us to search our souls. I have searched mine and I believe, instead of lamentation and whining about our circumstances, we should let those seeking to lead our nation know the kind of nation we want.\n\nI worry for our nation when ethnicity rears its head; I cry inward when the issue of who is an indigene insists on taking the front row; and I wonder why I cannot be an indigene of anywhere I choose to live in Nigeria. I also believe I should be able to change my indigene status when I move elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe dreaded Boko Haram sect is still on the rampage. Many out there are looking for jobs that are not available. Not a few have died this week all because what we call medical centres are consulting rooms that they have been since the military era. Even the private clinics where we pay through our noses cannot compete outside of our shores.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn the past, our leaders have been callous in the management of our resources. Past error is no excuse for the current government not to change our fortunes like it promised.\n\nThere is a scary development around indigeneship that has reared its head in our nation. Now, we see instances an indigene of a state who resides in another state is considered by those at home as an outsider. This has come to play in states such as Osun and Ekiti, during electioneering campaigns. Indigenes living in places like Ibadan and Lagos have been portrayed as outsiders. You hear politicians saying they do not want \u2018Lagos or Ibadan people\u2019. The impression these guys create is that you can only identify with your state if you live in your home town. Yet, many back home depend on remittances from those in Lagos and Ibadan to survive.\n\nAnother development that scares me is the migration of Nigerians through the Sahara desert, a development which is akin to walking with eyes open into enslavement. The exodus is to escape the \u2018Animal Farm\u2019 we currently inhabit. Most of the men and women who take this root are educated but hopeless.\n\nIn Abubakar Adam Ibrahim\u2019s \u2018Season of Crimson Blossom\u2019, a woman was well over 50 before she got her groove and experienced what it really means to be a woman! It is not too late for Nigeria. We can experience the much-desired orgasm even at this age!\n\nThe President I want is the one who can right the wrongs of the past. I want a President who will make nepotism a thing of the past. I want a President who will ensure no Nigerian feels left out because of which part of the country he or she comes from.\n\nI seek a President who will end this era of epileptic supply of electricity. I will be glad that day when our electricity generating sets will only be useful for picnics at beaches and such places where temporary source of power is required.\n\nI want a President who will provide enough direction for members of the National Assembly to truly legislate in the interest of the people and not out of any pecuniary interest. I am sick and tired of the current situation where everything but national interest seems to take the first position.\n\nI also want a President who will give us a Nigeria where our schools can compete with others in the advanced world. I long for a President who will take Nigeria out of the Third World. What is wrong with being a First World?\n\nI look forward to a President who will deliver a Nigeria where we can reap from medical tourism instead of the current situation where we are the major loser to this trend.\n\nI certainly want a President who will make our economy so robust that we can hold our head high anywhere in the world and our green passport will command respect and not scorn.\n\nI look forward to a President who will give us a Nigeria where oil takes the back seat and agriculture and tourism take the front seat and contribute more to our foreign exchange earnings and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nI look forward to a president who will develop our tourism sector, permanently solve the power challenge, defeat the terrorists and make the country a no-go-area for bandits.\n\nMy final take: I want a President who will give us new songs, not songs of sorrow, not songs of despair, but songs of joy, songs of a country, which experiences orgasm at old age and hold on to it forever! I do not want a President like Samusangudu in Adebayo Williams\u2019 The Remains of the Last Emperor\u2019.",

It has no basis at all.\n\nWe also have a motion requesting the court to grant bail to the Defendant\u201d, Ozekhome added.\n\nOn his part, the prosecution counsel, Labaran, argued that Kanu\u2019s two applications were not ripe for hearing, stressing that he would require time to go through them so as to be able to respond.\n\nIn essence, the business of the day cannot be allowed to be truncated by these applications\u201d, he argued.\n\nIn a brief ruling, Justice Nyako noted that since Kanu\u2019s first application is challenging the propriety of his trial as well as competence of the charge against him, the court ought to hear it first.\n\nAs for the second motion (on the issue of bail), I don\u2019t even want to talk about it, at least not at this stage\u201d, Justice Nyako held.\n\nThe court subsequently adjourned till February 16 to hear the pending application.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Government had moved bags of documentary evidence likely to be used against Kanu into the courtroom as heavy security heralded his arraignment.\n\nAlso, electronic equipment comprising various cameras have been brought to court and being inspected by the lead counsel to the federal government Mr Shuaib Magaji Labaran.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

This one is almost off-white. Also, make sure that you allow him to exercise and give him a good mattress\u201d, Justice Nyako had ordered.\n\nMeanwhile, when the matter was called up on Wednesday, the Prosecution counsel, Mr Shuaibu Labaran, told the court that Kanu was the one that chose to wear his designer Fendi clothes.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy lord, based on your order yesterday, we provided Defendant with a new Orthopedic mattress, pillows and blankets.\n\n\u201cAs for his appearance, he chose to wear this particular one because he said that it is designers\u201d.\n\nIn his response, Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, told the court that it was not true that his client insisted on wearing his designer clothes.\n\n\u201cMy lord what happened was that by the time proceedings ended yesterday, and because it was not his visiting day, we were not able to pass to him, some clothes we obtained for him.\n\n\u201cWe even discussed it with him this morning and he said that on the next visiting day he would want to have the new clothes\u201d, Ozekhome added.\n\nHe however commended the DSS for providing the IPOB leader with new mattress and pillows.\n\n\u201cI want to commend the DSS and the Court for ensuring that it was done\u201d.\n\nBefore allowing Kanu to be re-arraigned, Justice Nyako reiterated her demand for Defendant to have a change of clothes.\n\nThere was heavy security as a combined team of armed security operatives have cordoned off the roads leading to the premises of the Federal High Court complex.\n\nAs early as 6:00 am, a detachment of security personnel had been deployed around the court premises.",
          "summary": "While attacking the competent of the charges, Kanu said he was innocent of all the allegations contained in the amended charge.\nHe further added through his lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), that some counts in the amended charge were similar.\nThe IPOB leader has consequently asked the court to quash the charges and set him free.\nBefore allowing Kanu to be re-arraigned, Justice Nyako reiterated her demand for Defendant to have a change of clothes.\nAs early as 6:00 am, a detachment of security personnel had been deployed around the court premises.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji and Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives, are expected to commence fresh work on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, following its rejection by President Muhammadu Buhari last December.\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, while welcoming lawmakers from their annual Christmas break said the vacation afforded senators the opportunity to consult widely with their constituents and counterparts in the House of Representatives on the subject.\n\nSimilarly, Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said the House would re-introduce the Electoral Act Amendment Bill today and address all the concerns raised about it, pass and send it back to President Muhammadu Buhari for his assent.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that the new bill may be passed immediately. Lawan also confirmed this to State House correspondents after he met with President Buhari.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, tomorrow (today), both chambers will pass the bill. And I hope that before the end of the week, the bill could be brought back to Mr. President for his assent. But one thing I\u2019m sure, by the grace of God, is (that) we are passing the bill, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2010, tomorrow (today), the 19th (of January) in both chambers, and we are happy that at the end of the day, we have been able to narrow down our differences and arrived at the very patriotic resolution that our country must have a new electoral law that will guide the 2023 general elections in the country, and Nigeria would have everything to benefit from this law.\n\n\u201cAnd for us in the ninth assembly, the Electoral Act amendment bill is one of our major legislative agenda that we wanted to deal with. And to the glory of God Almighty Allah, by tomorrow (today), we will be able to pass that bill for Mr. president to assent to it. I hope that the cleaning process will not take more than a day. But if it does, then it has to be early next week. But I\u2019m very optimistic that there is not much to clean because normally when we pass a bill like this, it goes to the legislative drafting unit of the National Assembly. So, what you have in the National Assembly, as passed, is not the final document that comes to the president. And I know that many people were saying there were so many flaws in the bill that was brought to Mr. President. Maybe, what they had was the bill passed in the Senate or in the House not the one that was cleaned up, the final document that was cleaned up, because even us, we didn\u2019t have that document, we signed it off but I appreciate the efforts of all Nigerians in taking interest in what we do, and even participating by way of looking for what is right and what is not when we pass our bills or in terms of legislative activities, generally.\u201d\n\nHe said the lawmakers have resolved to look at the possibility of opening up the mode of primaries to include direct, indirect and even consensus modes.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s up to political parties to decide which option is okay for them, and at what time, but I\u2019m sure that all the options will be used by political parties, in different occasions or whatever.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, while reiterating the commitment of the House to give the country a new electoral law before the 2023 polls, said besides direct primaries, the proposed electoral law contained other provisions that would benefit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have to choose between sticking to our guns regarding the provision to mandate direct primary elections for political parties or reworking that provision to save the rest of the bill.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe, however, said the objective of the House in making direct primaries mandatory for nomination for political parties was to strengthen the country\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cI remain convinced that the proposal for direct primary elections is valuable for building accountability in our political system. But we must not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Therefore, the House will reintroduce the amendment tomorrow (today). And we will work quickly to address the mitigating concerns, pass the bill and send it back to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\u201d\n\nBuhari had cited the removal of indirect primaries from the 2010 Electoral Amendment Act by the National Assembly as reason for vetoing the Amendment Bill sent by the National Assembly.\n\nHe also complained about the humongous cost of conducting direct primaries by political parties and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nMeanwhile, Lawan has bemoaned the state of affairs in the country saying Nigeria was caught between the devil and deep blue sea.\n\nHe lamented that funding of the 2022 budget is predicated on significant borrowing.\n\n\u201cOur country is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. We have to construct and provide infrastructure, in all parts of our country because infrastructure is needed for our nation to develop. However, we do not generate enough revenues to fund the provision of such infrastructure. Until more revenues are generated, the country has to borrow and also resort to other sources of funding our infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to borrow endlessly. It is imperative that we need to improve on the revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio. At about eight per cent revenue to GDP ratio, our country is basically at 50 per cent of what is required of the revenue to GDP of 15 per cent for it to support any significant economic development.\n\n\u201cThe senate will develop a strategy of engagement with revenue generating agencies on how to make them achieve their targets and generate more revenues in 2022. The Senate will ensure that we boost their revenue generating drive with a view to reducing borrowing for development of our much needed infrastructure. This is a major challenge for our development and we need to treat as such.\u201d\n\nOn insecurity, he said: \u201cThe security situation in our country is still dire. We must remain focused and determined to work with Executive arm of government, and also continue to support our armed forces and security agencies. We must continue to prioritise the Security and welfare of our citizens as enshrined in your constitution nor despair. I urge us not to be discouraged by the situation. We should make this year as the year for the final securing of our nation from the numerous security challenges.\u201d",

          "text": "Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia\n\nAn Abia State high court in Umuahia Wednesday ordered the Federal Government and the Army high command to pay a sum of N1 billiin compensation to the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) over the invasion of his home in 2017.\n\nJustice Benson Anya gave the order in the judgement he delivered in the suit filed by Kanu against the Federal Government, Attorney General of the Federation, Chief of Army Staff(COAS)and five other respondents.\n\nThe court also ordered the Federal Government to issue a written apology to the IPOB leader for violating his fundamental human rights and destroying his home during the military operation code named Python Dance II.\n\nHowever the Court declined jurisdiction over the issue of the abduction and extradition of the IPOB leader from Kenya, saying that such powers resides with the federal high court.\n\nKanu had in August 2021 filed the suit through his special counsel, Mr. Aloy Ejimakor, challenging his \u201crendition from Kenya, unlawful detention and subsequent trial by the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nHe had asked the court to grant him eight relief, including \u201ca declaration that the military invasion of the Applicant\u2019s building and premises at Isiama, Afaraukwu Ibeku, Abia State on 10th September, 2017 by the respondents or their agents is illegal, unlawful, unconstitutional and amount to infringement of the applicant\u2019s fundamental right to life, dignity of his person, his personal liberty and fair hearing\u201d as guaranteed under the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe separatist leader also asked the court to make \u201can order mandating and compelling the respondents to pay the sum of N5 billion to the applicant\u201d as damages.\n\nBut Justice Anya said that in awarding N1billon to the applicant, the Court took cognisant of the \u201cexamplary and compensatory damages\u201d done to the applicant by the respondents.\n\nHe held that the military invasion of Kanu\u2019s home in September 2017 was \u201cunlawful and a violation of his fundamental human rights\u201d hence \u201cthe applicant deserves an apology\u201d as well as compensation from the Federal Government.\n\nAnya faulted the claims by the federal authorities and its security agencies that they did not invade the IPOB leader\u2019s home, describing the denial as \u201cflimsy and ineffectual\u201d as the military operation was notorious and could not escape judicial notice.\n\nHe added that even the Federal Government was not responsible for the invasion of Kanu\u2019s home it should have taken steps to investigate it and punish those found culpable.\n\nThe judge stated that Nigeria being an integral part of the democratic world has a responsibility to respect the rights of its citizens, adding that Nigeria should not only borrow a leaf from democratic nations but aspire to be a shinning example for others to follow.\n\nHe warned that torture, abductions, killings, and other forms of violence \u201cdo not resolve conflicts but fertilise them\u201d.\n\nJustice Anya therefore advised the Federal Government to apply wisdom and dialogue in its handling of the case of Kanu and separatist agitations in the interest of peace, harmony and national cohesion.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the court session, Kanu\u2019s special counsel, Ejimakor said that the verdict had vindicated the IPOB leader, who was accused of jumping bail when he fled Nigeria following the invasion of his home.\n\nHe said that the court had now established that there was actual invasion by the army and threat to his life hence he could not have jumped bail by running away to save his own life which was under serious threat.\n\nCounsel to the Army, Mr. Amos Tori in his reaction to the judgment said that the army authorities would study the court verdict and respond appropriately.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said he will need to consult with relevant agencies to know the exact position of government on whether or not fuel subsidy will be stopped this year.\n\nMohammed, who spoke with newsmen after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, explained that he was going to initiate a fact-finding process to determine the state of things on the removal of petroleum subsidy following the announcement Tuesday by Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, that President Buhari had not told anyone to remove fuel subsidy.\n\nWhen asked to clarity the issue since the 2022 budget has no subsidy provision beyond June 2022, the minister said he needed to consult with the relevant government agencies to determine the exact position of the subsidy removal question.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs for the removal of fuel subsidy, I think you will give me time to consult with relevant departments and ministries and I will get back to you.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had announced that the federal government made provision for petrol subsidy only for the first six months of 2022 as the government looked towards a complete deregulation of the sector.\n\nShe had said: \u201cIn our 2022 budget, we only factored in subsidy for the first half of the year. The second half of the year, we are looking at complete deregulation of the sector, saving foreign exchange and potentially earning more from the oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nReacting to Ahmed\u2019s position after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja on Tuesday, Senate President, Lawan, told newsmen that President Buhari had not directed anyone in his government to implement the removal of petroleum subsidy.\n\nBut he also conceded that subsidy was a big burden, noting that a solution had to be found to it.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, it will be of interest to Nigerians to hear what I\u2019ve come to discuss with Mr. President among several other things.\n\n\u201cMany of us are very concerned with the recent agitations, protests and many citizens were so concerned, our constituents across the country are very concerned that the federal government will remove the petroleum subsidy. And for us, as parliamentarians, as legislators representing the people of Nigeria, this must be of interest to us.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve just finished our recess, we had gone home to our constituencies and senatorial districts. And we felt the pulse of our people. And I found it necessary to visit Mr. President, as the the leader of our government and our leader in the country, to discuss this particular issue of concern to Nigerians, and I\u2019m happy to inform Nigerians that Mr. President never told anyone that the petroleum subsidy should be removed.\n\n\u201cI know and I agree that the subsidy is very heavy. But I think we must never transfer the burden to the citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "UPDATED: Electoral Bill: Senate Reverses Self, Okays Direct, Indirect, Consensus for Party Primaries",
          "text": "The Senate on Wednesday, dumped its insistence on the mandatory direct primary mode of electing candidates of political parties as contained in the 2010 Electoral Act (amendment) Bill 2021 passed by the National Assembly last year.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari however declined assent to the bill asking the nation\u2019s parliament to give political parties opportunities to adopt other options apart from direct primary.\n\nThe red chamber at plenary on Wednesday, bowed to the request of the president and re-amended the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, passed on November 18, 2021.\n\nThe chamber expunged the controversial provision in Clause 84(2) and replaced it with direct and indirect primaries or consensus as procedure for electing and nominating candidates by political parties for the various elective positions.\n\nIt also approved the recommended Clause 84 (3) that \u201ca political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of Presidential primaries, all registered members of the party are to vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the Federation.\n\n\u201c(b) Similar procedure as in (a) above, shall be adopted for Gubernatorial, Senatorial, Federal and State Constituencies.\n\n\u201c(b) Special Convention should be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centres at the National, State, Senatorial, Federal and State constituencies\u201d.\n\nClause 84(4) further provides that \u201ca political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, a political party shall:\n\n\u201c(i) hold special presidential convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\n\u201c(ii) The aspirant with the highest number of votes at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the presidential primaries of the political party and the aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party\u201d.\n\nClause 84 (6) provides that where there is only one aspirant, or a consensus candidate, the party shall convene a special convention or congress at designated centres on a specified date for the confirmation of such aspirant.\n\nMeanwhile, both chambers of the federal parliament would now set up a conference committee to harmonise the differences in the version of the bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. While the Senate approved the direct, indirect and consensus arrangements as the mode of party primaries, the House of Representatives expunged the option of consensus from the version it passed. The option of consensus candidate which both houses have a differing opinion on, would necessitate the setting up of a conference committee by the two chambers. The conference committee are expected to harmonise both positions and report back to the two chambers at plenary on Tuesday next week. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Kabiru Gaya, told journalists after plenary that the bill would be transmitted to the president next week. Gaya said: \u201cWe expect the conference committee to meet this week. We will expect their report at plenary next Tuesday. The National Assembly will transmit the clean copy to the president before the end of next week.\u201d\n\nThe amendments followed a motion for its re-commital to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nThe motion was sponsored by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe Senate Leader, in his presentation, recalled that President Buhari had signified withholding his assent on the Electoral Act No. 6 2010 (Repeal and Re-enactment) Bill, 2021 which was passed by the National Assembly and forwarded to the President on Thursday, 18th November, 2021.\n\nAbdullahi noted that the rational for withholding assent bordered on his observation in Clause 84.\n\nBuhari had in the letter dated December 13, 2021, and addressed to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, explained that his decision to withhold assent to the electoral bill was informed by advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government after a thorough review.\n\nAccording to the president, signing the bill into law would have serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences on the country, particularly in view of Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nAbdullahi, however, explained that the motion for re-commital of the bill to the Committee on the Whole was against the backdrop of the \u201cneed to address the observation by Mr. President C-in-C and make necessary amendment in accordance with Order 87(c) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 (as amended); and relying on order 1(b) and 52(6) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 ( as amended)\u201d.\n\nAccordingly, the chamber rescinded its decision on the affected clause of the bill as passed and recommit same to the Committee of the While for consideration and passage.\n\nSpeaking after the bill had been passed, the President of the Senate, Lawan, pledged that the red chamber would work with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to achieve free, fair and credible elections.\n\nLawan therefore urged the electoral umpire to take advantage of the proposed legislation, when assented to, and give Nigerians an election that they would be proud of.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is one bill that Nigerians particularly are so interested in because it is one sure way of enhancing our electoral processes and producing leaders at various levels of governance.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today is to respond to the observation of Mr President and because our constituents and other stakeholders on the need for us to expedite action on addressing those observations made by Mr President and we have done that very patriotically.\n\n\u201cToday as the bill stands, there is provision for all possible options for selection of candidates from presidency to the councillorship.\n\n\u201cThe available options we have are: the direct primaries, indirect primaries and consensus candidature.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that political parties are now, once this becomes law, challenged to ensure that they choose what is appropriate, what is suitable for them when it comes to the processes of producing their candidates.\n\n\u201cI will urge that we should practise all these three so that we are able to develop them. Because there is advantage in each just as there could be disadvantage in all of them.\n\n\u201cOurs is to ensure proper and appropriate application of these models, if we don\u2019t, as practising politicians, if the parties don\u2019t, and try to go round the circles and may be cutting corners, these processes will continue to be disadvantaged at all times.\n\n\u201cWith this, we also hope that INEC will take advantage of all the available amendments including what they suggested to the committees will be amendments that will enhance their activities, performance.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic that once the clean copy of this bill is sent to the president, he will assent to the bill and that will mark a very important moment for the politics, democracy in this country.\n\n\u201cWe will still be around to ensure that INEC receives every possible support from the National Assembly for INEC to conduct the 2023 elections successfully, transparently and with the integrity that Nigerians will all be proud of when it comes to either off season elections or the general election in 2023.\n\n\u201cLaws alone will not be alone, we could have the best laws if we don\u2019t operate them properly, they may not mean much.\n\n\u201cI urge practitioners, politicians and INEC to ensure that we obey and operate the laws as provided in the electoral act.\u201d",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is not a win for the government or citizens",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is its government\u2019s most recent effort to control social media. While experts tell us that this is a failed attempt at the project, they warn that the deal will definitely have a bearing on internet freedom in the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government banned Twitter for 7 months and only lifted the ban last week after it claimed Twitter has agreed to certain terms. The social media company has, reportedly, agreed to register as a legal entity in Nigeria, pay taxes, and cooperate with Nigeria, through the Partner Support and Enforcement Portal, to regulate harmful content.\n\nTomiwa Ilori, an internet freedom researcher, says the Twitter ban sets a very bad precedent for internet freedom in the country, and if freedom of information requests and lawsuits seeking to get accurate, official, and economic explanations for the government\u2019s actions are not filed now, \u201cwe might have opened up the online right of Nigerians to express [themselves only according] to the whims of politicians.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, like in other parts of Africa, laws made by the government to regulate violent, harmful, and fake speech are used to stifle legitimate online speech.\n\nWhile explaining that he isn\u2019t aware of the exact law that the government relied on for the Twitter ban, Ilori said the Nigerian Communications Act\u2019s (NCA) long history of being weaponised to block access to internet websites makes it a prime suspect. \u201cMy guess is that they used the provisions of sections 146 and 148 of the NCA to get the telcos to block access to Twitter, as they have done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne major issue with these NCA provisions is that the government gets to decide what is in the public interest or is an emergency, as the basis of their request to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). There is no judicial review, human rights impact assessment of proposed actions before and after such requests, or public access to requests made to the internet service providers (ISPs) by the NCC. It is also important to note that ISPs do not push back or carry out necessary assessments before compliance.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban is not a win for Nigerians\n\nIlori explained that the lifting of the ban means that Nigerians need to start thinking about terms of legal reforms for online expression in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think the portal could be a great avenue for bridging sides. Having a dedicated means of reporting speech capable of causing violence and harm by proximate actors could help forestall violence. But who are these actors? I ask, because Twitter and the government should not be the only ones determining the nature and type of expression that Nigerians are allowed to share,\u201d Ilori says.\n\nIlori believes that there is a need to expand the content governance arrangement to include civil society actors, experts, and activists.\n\nThe government memo which contained the terms of lifting the ban states that the Portal would serve as a channel for law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.\n\nHowever, Ilori thinks that the government\u2019s power in the agreement is secondary and the actual moderation of content would lie with Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not a win for the government either\n\nFor Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights group, the government didn\u2019t score any points with the Portal, as it has existed for a while now; it only looks like a win for the Nigerian government because it hasn\u2019t used it before.\n\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s Transparency Report\u2014a report that gives insights into information and removal requests from around the world, by country\u2014Nigeria has made zero removal requests and just 7 information requests, at the time of reporting. However, India has made 12,435 legal removal requests, 67 court orders, and 12,368 other legal demands, representing 6% of global removal requests. According to the report, Twitter complied with 12.4% of India\u2019s requests.\n\nIn February last year, India\u2019s government enacted a fresh social media rule that made social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others more accountable to legal requests. This law allows the government to tag content as \u201cunlawful\u201d while forcing messaging service providers to identify posters of specific messages.\n\nThis regulation has its origin in the Indian government\u2019s semisweet relationship with Twitter. The government asked Twitter to take down some content it alleged was spreading misinformation about farmers protesting agricultural reform. But, to the chagrin of the Indian government, Twitter partially complied and restored access to some of the accounts it had blocked \u201cin a manner that we believe was inconsistent with Indian law,\u201d Twitter wrote at the time.\n\nThis, Sesan said, was the reason the Nigerian government has repeatedly tried to enact social media bills. But failed. First came the Frivolous Petitions Bill, which seeks to prevent the spread of falsehood on social media, with jail time and a $10,000 fine. Like subsequent remakes of the bill, it was withdrawn, after 6 months of widespread public criticism.\n\n\u201cSocial media bills\u201d as they would later be called, have been resurrected, over the years, in the form of 2 other bills: the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill.\n\nBut Sesan says Nigeria\u2019s internet restriction tactics are miles behind India\u2019s because the latter drew up regulations; Twitter will only respond to legal requests backed by legislation. \u201cIndia drew up new laws on social media that were specific. Nigeria made similar demands, but there is no bill in parliament making that case.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global pandemic brought the travel and tourism industry to a halt, but as normalcy is being restored, we\u2019re thinking about travel in marvelling ways. Humans are social animals to the core, and travelling helps hone this social instinct.\n\nInterestingly, different companies are creating exciting solutions for the travel sector, and there seems to be a world of opportunities. Meta\u2019s (Formerly Facebook) Metaverse is perhaps the most compelling so far, and it feels futuristic. Our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, had some compelling arguments regarding tourism and COVID-19 in this article.\n\nToday on Techpoint Build Spotlight, we\u2019re catching up with Akinnuga Ayobami, COO of Tramango, one of Africa\u2019s innovators in the travel space and the official travel partner for Techpoint Build 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you give us an idea of what Tramango does?\n\nWe are a full-service travel-tech company delivering premium travel experiences in Africa. At Tramango, we help individuals and organisations have memorable experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe offer a range of services that covers flight booking, stay reservations, visa assistance and documentation, concierge services and destination marketing.\n\nWith the development of the tourism industry in Africa, we firmly believe that the industry can lead to business and economic growth.\n\nHow would you explain your startup\u2019s value offering to a five-year-old?\n\nWe help people get around their favourite countries quickly and easily and give them pleasurable experiences in those countries.\n\nWhat makes Tramango excited about Techpoint Build 2021?\n\nTechpoint Build is helping African entrepreneurs showcase their ideas to the world and funding opportunities through Pitchstorm, the startup competition.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complexities that come with using blockchain or crypto platforms is one of the many reasons most people tend to stay away from it. The intricate-looking platforms usually dissuade many who have sought my help in starting their crypto journey.\n\nWhile data by Chainalysis shows that crypto adoption rate is increasing rapidly, findings by Triple A, a company that helps businesses accept crypto payments, cryptocurrency users globally are barely a fraction of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIn 2021, Triple A estimated that the global crypto ownership rate is at an average of 3.9%, with 300 million \u2014 4.285% of the global population \u2014 crypto owners globally.\n\nOluchi Enebeli and Clement Hugbo, Co-founders of Crevatal, are combining years of experience in the blockchain space to simplify blockchain and foster mainstream adoption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is blockchain complicated?\n\nBlockchain is said to be one of the technologies that will usher in the fourth industrial revolution. However, it is still a concept most people can\u2019t wrap their heads around. The technology, in itself, is a means of storage that provides accessibility to saved information but still provides high-level security through decentralisation.\n\nIt stores information in multiple places simultaneously, and these different locations become a network. By keeping the information in separate areas, alterations become problematic because they must be done simultaneously across all points.\n\nAlthough the tech in its simplest form is simply a clever way to store information, it has, in recent years, evolved to reveal other capabilities, especially in the area of finance (cryptocurrency) and, more popularly, Web3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClement Hugbo \u2013 CEO, Co-Founder, Crevatal\n\nHugbo believes the reason why this revolutionary tech is still complex for many to use is that the builders are not paying attention to a critical component \u2014 design.\n\n\u201cFor every new technology that makes its way into the tech ecosystem, one of the first people that the ecosystem looks up to for growth are the developers and the programmers.\n\n\u201cDesigners are sometimes less valued when it comes to creating products.\u201d\n\nHe adds that while their importance is relatively well understood in the tech ecosystem, design needs more attention when it comes to new tech like blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluchi Enebeli, Co-Founder, Crevatal\n\nEnebeli\u2019s opinion on why blockchain is hard to use leans towards Hugbo\u2019s. As a blockchain engineer, she admits that the tech is quite complex. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new ballgame,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd being different from what everyone is used to makes it even harder.\n\nBeing a blockchain developer, she also understands the excitement of building new products and not paying attention to the ease of using the products.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s a maturing technology, developers are the major people in the space.\u201d\n\nHow Crevatal plans to make blockchain simpler\n\nCrevatal is a company that focuses on user experience (UX) design for blockchain and more specifically, Web3 products. Although the company started out doing other things, including backend engineering, integrating smart contracts, and tokenisation, it has decided to focus on design which it believes is a crucial ingredient to blockchain adoption.\n\nCreativity is vital to tech, and Crevatal believes strongly in it. In fact, the name Crevatal is a combination of the words, creativity and vital.\n\nFounded in late 2019, the goal for Crevatal is to become the most revered blockchain design company in Africa. It started pursuing this goal fully in 2020 when Enebeli, who has been a blockchain engineer since 2016, came on board.\n\nShe has worked for global blockchain companies like Binance, Crypto.com, and Bundle. Hugbo also has years of experience in the blockchain space, and the duo is combining their skills and expertise to bring simplicity to blockchain, one product at a time.\n\nUsing Web2 talents to build Web3 products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, tech talent is scarce in Africa, but finding blockchain talent is even more challenging.\n\nThis, however, isn\u2019t a problem for Crevatal as it doesn\u2019t actively recruit ready-made blockchain talents. They are using a route I consider rather cumbersome: taking in Web2 talents and grooming them into blockchain and Web3 masters.\n\nSide note: Web2 talents are tech talents that build Internet-based products for the current Internet iteration. Web3 talents, on the other hand, make decentralised blockchain-based products.\n\nBesides the co-founders, most team members are new to blockchain or Web3. The idea is to induct them into the fold by learning on the job.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to learn is actually through service, and this way, you begin to learn passively. We train and teach new members that come on board, and we create knowledge-sharing sessions where we share knowledge about blockchain technology.\n\nIn that process, they begin to pick things up. Understanding the intricacies of blockchain and how they connect with each other,\u201d Hufgbo said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrevatal website\n\nInterestingly, the absence of Web3 and blockchain talents isn\u2019t the only reason Crevatal has chosen to train its own talents. According to Enebeli, it\u2019s essential to have a fresh pair of eyes when designing blockchain platforms.\n\n\u201cIf you have been in the Web3 space for too long, you begin to lose touch with Web2 platforms and traditional finance platforms. You become so used to it that you don\u2019t see it the way a newbie would see it.\n\n\u201cFor example, people who have been on decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms don\u2019t see any issues with it as they\u2019ve gotten used to it over time. That is one of the reasons why we want to also have Web2 designers on the team; we want to see things through their eyes.\u201d\n\nMarrying crypto with food using Noshify\n\nWhile Crevatal is committed to helping companies and Web3 communities build platforms with simple UX design, it\u2019s also building platforms of its own, one of which is Noshify.\n\nNoshify is a platform with the most unlikely combination: cryptocurrency and food. It is a marketplace that connects independent food vendors to customers who have the option of paying in cryptocurrency.\n\nCrevatal believes that using cryptocurrencies for real-world uses beyond trading gets people more accustomed to them.\n\nFor Enebeli and Hugbo, the drive to create simple platforms comes from the passion they have for blockchain. They believe that it is a technology that could revolutionise Africa and provide true financial freedom.\n\nWhile several factors stand against the use of blockchain beyond simplicity, it is, however, an excellent place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "10 years after protest, over $60bn on subsidy, no change",
          "text": "Ten years after the #OccupyNigeria protest against petrol subsidy removal, the Nigerian government has only abolished it on paper. It is unclear if another attempt to remove it in six months will happen because of a political backlash as in a year before elections, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\nIn its most recent report on Nigeria, the EIU said, \u201cPast attempts to lift price controls (most recently in 2020) were abandoned after a political backlash, and the government will want to avoid a repeat so close to the polls.\u201d\n\nNigeria spent over $63 billion between 2005 and 2018 on petrol subsidy, according to data from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Last year alone, Nigeria spent $4.5 billion on petrol subsidy, according to the World Bank, and during the subsidy scandal in 2011, Nigeria spent $6.8 billion on subsidy. A back-of-the-envelope estimation puts subsidy spend in the last 10 years at over $60 billion.\n\nIn August 2021, the Federal Government passed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which prescribes the deregulation of the downstream sector, putting an end to petrol subsidy and the infrastructure that enables it. On the 10th anniversary of that protest, the Buhari administration is yet to implement the law ending the practice.\n\nOn January 1, 2012, the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan announced the removal of fuel subsidy triggering demonstrations in major cities across Nigeria the next day.\n\nProtests\n\nTwo of Nigeria\u2019s largest labour unions \u2013 Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) \u2013 capitalised on the popular outrage and called for a national strike that began on January 9.\n\nSoon, the Nigerian Medical Association and the Nigerian Bar Association, as well as a number of other unions, backed the strike while many protesters began to refer to their cause as \u201c#OccupyNigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing civil disobedience and confrontations with security agencies, 11 protesters were reportedly killed.\n\nDamage control\n\nIn the face of mounting pressure, the Jonathan administration began to make some concessions. He announced the formation of a panel to oversee the funds freed up by the elimination of the fuel subsidy.\n\nThe government proposed cutting government salaries by 25 percent and bought some buses that would reduce transportation costs. Rather than eliminate the subsidy, the government succeeded in increasing the petrol price from N65 to N141 per litre.\n\nLogic fails\n\nAs was true in 2012, petrol subsidy was a drain on the country. It starves critical sectors of scarce resources for economic growth, fosters smuggling of petroleum products across Nigeria\u2019s insecure borders, and disrupts markets on the continent.\n\nJust like Jonathan\u2019s government did, the Buhari government has argued then that the removal of subsidy would free up funds for other public services, including health and infrastructure projects, and that the liberalisation of the downstream sector would benefit the economy.\n\nThey also argued that the primary beneficiaries of the subsidy were the wealthy, who used more petrol than the poor, and wholesalers who made a profit selling subsidized petrol out of the country.\n\nAjuri Ngelale, one of Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, recently told BusinessDay in an interview, \u201cOur neighbours that don\u2019t have the kind of economic fundamentals pay as much as N400 per liter. Yet their minimum wage is much lower.\n\n\u201cWe also have to live in a way that is more realistic so that the government can put resources into those things that are more profitable to the common ordinary Nigerians. This is the redistribution of resources that the President is more committed to.\u201d\n\nBut those agitating against subsidy removal have countervailing arguments, saying it is a shame that Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer cannot refine its own petrol leaving its three refineries in decay.\n\nRead also: Group plans protest against petrol subsidy removal, excise duty on soft drinks\n\nNigeria with highly-rated security agencies cannot curtail smuggling, and though petrol is imported, government charges at the port add to the cost per litre. This raises the fear that any increase will trigger runway inflation. Already, Nigeria has the world\u2019s poorest people and any extra burden is a recipe for chaos.\n\nTo worsen matters, successive government officials have been accused of stealing mind-boggling sums of money. When factored along with the putrid opulence of government officials and reckless public spending on salaries of unproductive lawmakers, it defeats any argument for the people to make sacrifices for a wasteful government.\n\nPresident Jonathan on January 16, 2012, rescinded the decision to remove the petrol subsidy but increased the pump price to N97 per litre, which was significantly lower than the N141 that reflected the landing cost of petrol. The unions called off the strike, and the protests ceased.\n\nRenewed push\n\nAccording to Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget, and national planning, \u201cThe government has concluded plans to end fuel subsidies by July 2022, paving the way for the full implementation of the PIA.\n\nThe minister, while responding to a question at the public presentation and breakdown of the highlights of the 2022 budget in Abuja, said, \u201cWe have only provided subsidies for petrol from January to June. And that means that from July, there is no provision that we made for fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cOur assumption is that by June, we would have been able to work through a process together with all stakeholders including the National Oil Company, all the regulators in the oil and gas sector, different MDAs that have a role to play as well as businesses and labour organisations.\n\n\u201cMoreover, by removing subsidies, the government is only complying with the PIA, which specifies that all petroleum products should be deregulated.\u201d\n\nDangote Refinery\n\nDespite some delays caused by shipping constraints, the 650,000 barrels per day (b/d) Dangote Refinery, which is set to be Africa\u2019s largest, is on track to begin operations this year.\n\nThe refinery is expected to bridge the gas importation gap of Nigeria, which stands around 1 million -1.25 million cubic meters per month (mt/month) of gasoline due to inadequate domestic refining capacity, while noting that all its refineries, with a combined nameplate capacity to refine 445,000 b/d of crude oil, are currently shut down, according to a Dangote presentation given at an industry event last year.\n\n\u201cWhen fully operational, the plant will produce 327,000b/d of gasoline, 244,000b/d of gasoline/diesel, 56,000b/d of jet fuel/kerosene, and 290,000mt/year of propane/LPG,\u201d it said.\n\nWith this development, the country\u2019s economy might be on track to create a platform with the new PIA, where the interplay of the forces of demand and supply of oil and gas are expected to drive down the price of oil and gas in the country while maintaining the subsidy removal.",

          "title": "China, India freight cost declines as container scarcity abates",
          "text": "The cost of freighting containers from India and China ports to Nigeria is beginning to record a slight decline on the back of frequent ship sailing to Asian routes and an increase in the ability of importers to secure space onboard vessels due to the availability of empty containers.\n\nCurrently, moving a 20-foot and 40-foot container from India to Nigeria now costs between $4,000 and $7,000, down from between $7,500 and $15,000 previously charged by shipping companies in September 2021.\n\nFrom China, moving a 20-foot and 40-foot container to Nigeria now costs between $7,000 and $11,000 instead of $8,000 and $16,000 that were charged in September 2021, when the cost of freight was at a record high.\n\nConfirming this, Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment Limited, states that importers are beginning to see a reduction in the cost of freight from countries like India and China to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Anakebe, moving 20-foot and 40-foot containers from India to Nigeria that used to cost between $7,500 and $15,000 now costs a little above $4,000 and $7,000, respectively.\n\nFrom China to Nigeria, he says, importers that used to pay $8,000 and $16,000 to bring in 20-foot and 40-foot containers during the peak of the supply chain disruption in September are now paying between $7,000 and $11,000 to ship 20-foot and 40-foot containers, respectively.\n\nAnakebe however notes that there is still a bit of rush among importers that want to bring in their goods from China to Nigeria, which made the cost of freight from China to Nigeria to still remain a bit high.\n\nOn why the cost of freight is beginning to normalise, he says suppliers in the countries of origin are producing several goods that need to be moved to countries where they are needed.\n\n\u201cThe cost of freight started normalising around December 2021, and it has remained a bit stable till date because international shipping companies are now deploying more ships to India and China to lift containers,\u201d he explains.\n\nCurrently, he says the number of ships calling India and China ports has increased and the ability of importers to secure space onboard vessels is also becoming easier because containers are being made available for people to load their goods.\n\nOn his part, Jonathan Nicol, president of the Shippers Association of Lagos, notes that freight costs are coming down but are still far from becoming normal.\n\n\u201cThe US is beginning to charge shipping companies for leaving empty containers in their country that may form part of the reasons shipping liners are now deploying containers to ports where they are needed to load goods,\u201d Nicol says on the phone.\n\nWhile emphasising that shippers globally want the cost to come down in order to reduce the skyrocketing cost of doing business, he states that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) does not allow Nigerian shippers to pay above $5,000 per month for freight charges.\n\nRead also: Petrol price regulation expected to continue in 2022, could reach N208/litre\n\nIf a shipper has a freight that is more than $5,000, the shipper has to wait for another month to be able to pay up, according to Nicol.\n\nNicol, who notes that most of the goods are a backlog of as far as six months ago, however, attributes the rush in China to the upcoming annual holidays in China, which is forcing most of the suppliers to clear their tables.\n\n\u201cChinese Lunar New Year holiday, which is scheduled to start on February 1, 2022, is almost here. And many Chinese suppliers and factories will shut down for over one week. This is why many importers are rushing to take delivery before that time,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut, according to Container News, an online trade report, the freight rates may not soften anytime soon but would like to shoot up in the coming weeks.\n\nIt states that the current freight cost in China can be attributed to the COVID-19 variant, the changing purchasing patterns, the Chinese New Year that is around the corner, and the restocking of supplies that followed due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n\u201cThe current level of freight rates is a reflection or consequence of the disruptions in the market that are partially driven by the exceptional demand situation in the US and Europe,\u201d Container News notes.",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

He disclosed that their discussions were centred national issues with regards to security, electoral laws and the welfare of the country.\n\nHe said \u201cThis is not the first time I\u2019m going to see the President.

It\u2019s only when the party zone is officially to the South. I have said before that there are only two zones that have not been President : the Southeast and the Northeast. Once it\u2019s zoned to the Southeast I have the capacity and the capability I will roll out my campaign and rock like a hurricane\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overdue for an Igboman to become a Nigerian President, I believe the Southeast should produce the next President and it\u2019s going to happen \u201d.\n\nIn a further response Kalu slammed other Presidential aspirants in his All Progressives Congress (APC) who had gone to inform President Muhammadu Buhari about their intentions saying they were not serious people.\n\nHe said those already pushing are not being fair to the feelings of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThey are not serious. A serious minded person will like to be fair to Nigeria, to be fair to the society and be fair to the atmosphere because this party is not owned by me or by you the press people. It is only APC people that can decide where the party ticket will go to,If they zone it to the Southeast I have all it takes to make a good President\u201d.\n\nThe Abia North Senator said that he would pursue his Presidential Ambition with other geopolitical zones of the Nation, while stressing that he will commence Nationwide consultation at the right time.\n\nResponding to questions on the APC\u2019s forthcoming February 26th convention Kalu expressed optimism that the exercise will be raucous free saying that the outcome will make Nigerians proud.\n\nWhen asked about President Buhari\u2019s body language to the contentious electoral act and 2023 Kalu responded saying \u201cHe\u2019s body language is where other Nigerians are .

          "text": "The presidency has explained reasons why so many political elites want President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second term in office to end.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Tuesday, said the elites yearn for a return to the \u201cgood old days\u201d of helping themselves to public funds with abandon.\n\nAccording to him, the last thing they want is another person in the mould of President Buhari.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo many in the political elites of this country cannot wait for the President\u2019s second term in office to end.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey yearn for a return to the \u201cgood old days\u201d of helping themselves to public funds with abandon, the easy export of ill-gotten money to foreign bank accounts, of acting without responsibility, accountability, or censure. The last thing they want is \u201canother Buhari.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that even though the President will stand down after the election of a successor next year \u2013 whether that successor lives up to the exacting standards and example he has set or not \u2013 his legacy is strong and will be peculiarly tough to dismantle:.\n\n\u201cCourts that hold those before it fairly and properly accountable \u2013 regardless of their wealth or lack of it; the successful repatriation of stolen funds from decades of export abroad and its use to fund social, unemployment,\n\n\u201cAnd welfare programmes for the poorest; reforms that have taken the steam out of centuries-long ethnic and tribal disputes \u2013 such as the farmer-herder clashes \u2013 long used to stoke ethnic and regional tensions by venial politicians for political advantage;\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAnd the protection of millions through an effective vaccine roll-out programme. These are just a tiny handful of the achievements of the President,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut, perhaps, Shehu noted Buhari\u2019s greatest achievement of all is to break the belief that Presidents of Nigeria take the office and use it to enrich themselves and their accessories at the public\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cThat wicked spell is broken for good. And it has offended politicians everywhere. They thought the state owed to them while the people provided for the state. Instead, they have witnessed how, when the state owes to them nothing, it provides for the people,\u201d he added.",

We are grateful to the government. For the past 60 years, we have not seen such a thing here. This is the first time we are seeing this. We are thankful to the government, especially our governor and our speaker who is the son of the soil, Danladi. May God help them to the next level,\u201d Idris said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe experience navigating through this road in the past had been terrible. Now 50% is almost conquered. But in the past in the rainy season you cannot come here. The road will cut off.\n\n\u201cThe road was abandoned and the new government is trying for us and we are praising it for that. We are truly grateful.\u201d\n\nIdris explained that the road would boost the economy of the area as traders from Oyo, Osun and other parts of the country would be encouraged to buy farm produce from Baruten local government area.\n\n\u201cThere are so many farmers in the bush that will be able to bring in their goods from the farms to the nearby villages when the road is good. So many economic activities will spring once the road is fully done, and we have started seeing that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that the money coming in is meagre. But we urge the government to finish the road on time. We want the government to finish it within the next 12 months. We want the government to construct the road up till Gwabe beyond Gwanara.\u201d\n\nA commuter, Opeyemi Obisesan, said the ongoing construction has brought huge relief to him and others plying the road, saying the cost of transportation from Ilesha to Gwanara has also reduced.\n\n\u201cTravelling through bike (motorcycle) before now from Ilesha Baruba to Gwanara was N2000 but now it is N1000 because of what has been done. This is because the road is good now as a large portion has been tarred while other sections have been cleared. Before now, we could hardly pass through here with cars. We are now enjoying the road unlike in the past. The road is good. For now, to move from Ilesha to Gwanara is very easy for us,\u201d Obisesan said.\n\nIbrahim Adamu of Yekira community said he now passes through Ilesha Baruba to Gwanara with his bike with ease and urged the state government to extend the ongoing work to Yekira community.\n\nAnothe resident of Tambuyan Ahmed Halidu commended the Governor and the Speaker for working together to bring development to the area.",

          "text": "Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senate\u2019s Chief Whip, has stated that he is capable but not desperate to become President of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nThis came as he bemoaned the fact that the country\u2019s future president should have come from the country\u2019s South-East area.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, the former governor of Abia State remarked this to journalists during a plenary session at the National Assembly on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHas the party zoned the ticket to the South-East? I have said before that there are only two zones that have not been President -the South-East and the North-East. Once it\u2019s zoned to the South-East, I have the capacity and capability to roll out my campaign and rock like a hurricane.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overdue for an Igboman to become a Nigerian President, I believe the South-East should produce the next President and it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d the Senator said.\n\nHe also said that those who were against zoning the presidency to the South-East and North-East were not serious-minded and fair citizens of the country.\n\n\u201cThey are not serious. A serious-minded person will like to be fair to Nigeria, to be fair to society and be fair to the atmosphere because this party is not owned by me or by you the press people. It is only APC people that can decide where the party ticket will go. If they zone it to the Southeast, I have all it takes to make a good President,\u201d Kalu said.\n\nThe Chief Whip stressed that his visit to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday was because their relationship had spanned many years before he became President. He disclosed that their discussions were on national issues with regards to security, electoral laws and the welfare of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is not the first time I\u2019m going to see the President. People usually go in the afternoon but I went in the night to avoid the press.\n\n\u201cI go there regularly. It\u2019s a family affair and I went there to discuss national issues with regards to the security and wellbeing of our country and also the issue of the electoral law and the discussion was very fruitful.\u201d\n\nKalu stated that he would pursue his presidential ambitions with lawmakers from the country\u2019s other geographic zones, and that he would begin nationwide consultations at the appropriate moment.\n\nThe APC leader expressed excitement about the upcoming convention, which will take place on February 26. He told Nigerians that the process would be free of disorder, and that the outcome would make them proud of their country.\n\nKalu\u2019s announcement came just 24 hours after Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, met with President Buhari to express his interest in the top post, according to the PUNCH.\n\nThe Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, met with Buhari the next day to launch his candidacy for the presidency.",

          "title": "Electoral Act Amendment Bill: CSOs slam Senate\u2019s consensus option, Bill remains in limbo",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nHopes of possible resolution of the confusion around the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 were dimmed as the two chambers of the National Assembly Wednesday differed on the way out of the impasse.\n\nThe upper legislative chamber, had in collaboration with the House of Representatives November last year, as contained in clause 87(2), made direct primaries as the only option for political parties in electing candidates for general elections.\n\nBut refusing to assent the Bill, President Muhammadu Buhari said the provision was undemocratic and serious infraction on Constitution of the various political parties which has different options of direct , indirect and consensus arrangements for such elections.\n\nAccording to the president, signing the Bill into law would have serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences on the country, particularly in view of Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nSenate\u2019s position\n\nAnd as a way out, the Senate concurred with observations raised by the president by rescinding the mandatory direct primaries imposed on political parties for nomination of candidates.\n\nIn doing this, the Senate as listed on its order paper for Wednesday plenary, added indirect and consensus options to the mandatory direct provision earlier proposed.\n\nSpecifically, the upper legislative chamber in Clause 84(2) of the report approved direct, indirect primaries or consensus as procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions.\n\nIt also approved the recommended Clause 84(3) that \u201ca political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party.\u201d\n\nClause 84(4) further provides that \u201ca political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below; (a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, a political party shall, (i) hold special conventions in each of the 36 states of the federation and FCT, where delegates shall vote for each of the aspirants at designated centres in each State Capital on specified dates.\u201d\n\nThe clause provides that a National Convention shall be held for the ratification of the candidate with the highest number of votes.\n\nThe amendment followed a motion for its re-committal to the Committee of the Whole.\n\nSenate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North)\n\nIn his presentation, Abdullahi recalled that President Buhari had signified withholding his assent on the Electoral Act No. 6 2010 (Repeal and Re-enactment) Bill, 2021 which was passed by the National Assembly and forwarded to the President Thursday, 18th November, 2021.\n\nSenator Abdullahi noted that the rational for withholding assent bordered on his observation in Clause 84.\n\nHe, however, explained that the motion for re-committal of the Bill to the Committee on the Whole was against the backdrop of the \u201cneed to address the observation by Mr. President C-in-C and make necessary amendment in accordance with Order 87(c) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 (as amended); and relying on order 1(b) and 52(6) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 ( as amended).\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the chamber rescinded its decision on the affected Clause of the Bill as passed and recommitted same to the Committee of the Whole for consideration and passage.\n\nReps differ\n\nTaking a slightly different position however, the House of Representatives altered the controversial section 84 of the Electoral Act amendment Bill, leaving political parties with the option of adopting either direct or indirect primary mode in nominating candidates for elective positions.\n\nAt the resumption of plenary Tuesday, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila had hinted that the president\u2019s concerns would be addressed, and the Bill returned for his assent.\n\n\n\nBack from a closed door session that lasted about one hour Wednesday, the Speaker announced that the House would go straight into consideration of the single clause adjustment, and a motion to that effect was moved by Chairman Rules and Business Committee of the House Abubakar Fulata.\n\n\n\nThe adjustment which affected clause 84(2) of the original Bill to the effect that \u201cprocedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties shall be by direct or indirect primaries\u201d was subsequently approved in a Committee of the Whole of the House, presided over by Gbajabiamila himself.\n\n\n\n\u2018We were not cowed\u2019\n\nHowever, against the perception that the parliament was cowed into taking President Buhari\u2019s proposal, the House through its spokesman, Benjamin Kalu, insisted the Green Chamber acted to save democracy, noting that beside the controversial clause, there were so many other inherent benefits in the Bill as far as electoral reforms were concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did not jettison direct primary; we only made it an option. Political parties are left with whichever options they prefer according to their realities. There are so many other benefits in the Bill,\u201d Kalu said.\n\n\n\nOn whether the House\u2019s action was not a sharp contrast to the desires of majority of Nigerians, the lawmaker noted that \u201cthe president\u2019s reasons were placed on a good scale, in view of the times we are in before taking the action, as well as being guided by the limited time available to the nation\u2019s electoral umpire.\u201d\n\n\n\nCSOs reject consensus\n\nAnd in their reactions, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) Wednesday rejected the Senate\u2019s decision to introduce a completely new mode of \u201cconsensus\u201d as a procedure for candidates\u2019 nomination.\n\nThey, however, commended the National Assembly for being swift on resumption to review its position on direct primaries as the sole mode for nomination of candidates in the Electoral Bill 2021.\n\nThe CSOs stated this in a joint press statement signed by Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), The Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS),Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF), Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ) in Abuja.\n\nOthers include; Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGO) and Inclusive Friends Association (IFA).\n\nThey described the consensus mode as antithetical to democratic principles and that it would result in the subversion of popular will.\n\nThey further said: \u201cIt violates the rights of aspirants to equal participation in party primaries and limits the choice of voters to candidates who did not emerge from democratic primary elections. Judging from experience, consensus has occasioned a litany of litigations in Nigeria\u2019s electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the Senate to, in line with the popular will of Nigerians; adopt the position of the House of Representatives which now recognizes direct and indirect primaries as procedure for nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cWith this development, a harmonisation committee will now have to be constituted by the leadership of the National Assembly to harmonize the divergent positions of both chambers thereby delaying the speedy conclusion of the process.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call for the immediate withdrawal of this new introduction which is alien to the original Electoral Bill 2021 to speed up the work of the harmonization committee and conclusion of the amendment process on or before the 21 January 2022 deadline.\n\n\u201cAs indicated in our earlier statement, any further delay will undermine public confidence in the process and therefore unacceptable,\u201d they said.\n\nYiaga Africa, others\n\nAlso in a separate position, the Board Chair, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwagwu said, \u201cit is obvious the Senate continues to hoe to its side. The addition of the glaring undemocratic consensus option is a survival strategy. The aspiration of a greater number of citizens is for options that expand the democratic space and not constrict it.\n\n\u201cThey have to quickly go to conference to resolve the difference and our hope is that the National Assembly will transmit a democratic electoral bill to carry the hopes of Nigeria people for inclusive, people centric electoral law.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Director of Programmes Yiaga Africa Cynthia Mbamalu said the group lauded the National Assembly for prioritising the review of the contentious clause 84 on direct primaries in the Electoral Bill 2021 to enable speedy transmission to the president for assent.\n\nShe said considering the urgency of this Bill, it is important the harmonisation committee is constituted immediately to do the needful.\n\nShe, however, noted that in line with citizens\u2019 demand for transparent and credible primaries, the House of Representatives\u2019 version recognising direct and indirect mode of party primaries should be adopted.\n\n\u201cConsensus candidate nomination introduced by the Senate is contrary to the principles of democratic and transparent primaries, limits the right of aspirants to equal participation in primary elections and forces candidates on the people,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a similar reaction, a former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Unions Unity (OATUU), Owei Lakemfa, said: \u201cIt is a game. Many of those in power and can engineer a consensus, want indirect primaries while those out of power or the corridors hope for some luck with direct primaries.\n\n\u201cI know an ex-governor who favoured indirect primaries while in power, but now campaigns for direct primaries. Those who argue that direct primaries would be too expensive have not told Nigerians why and what is considered too expensive.\n\n\u201cFor instance, how much did direct party primaries cost in the Lagos State gubernatorial primaries viz-a-vis indirect primaries in many states?\n\n\u201cThe fact is that most of the parties are not built on democratic foundations so cannot deliver on democratic primaries whether direct or indirect, and certainly would not deliver on democratic dividends.\n\n\u201cI returned from observing elections in Venezuela six weeks ago and observed elections in countries like Zimbabwe and my conclusion is that elections are simple processes, but are difficult in our country because that is the system put in place.\u201d\n\nAPC excited\n\nAnd to a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Ismaeel Ahmed, the decision to afford parties options in electing their candidates is a welcome development.\n\nAhmed told Blueprint that that the party had always believed that political parties should have options in nominating and selecting their candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThe party\u2019s position has always been the same that the National Assembly should allow political parties option on how to nominate their candidates and the president said once that is removed and it is sent to him, he is ready to sign it. So we are excited about the National Assembly\u2019s response to the president\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\n",

          "text": "Inspector General of Police Usman Alkali Baba has said the Nigeria Police Force is deploying technology in virtually all areas of its operations in tackling new waves of banditry and kidnapping across the country.\n\nBaba said \u201cthe Marine unit has been reactivated, crime section digitalised, drones have been acquired while the Technical Intelligent Unit is fully functional to cope with new trends in crime and criminality.\u201d\n\nThe police boss spoke in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state, while addressing officers and men of the state command, Ikot Akpana-Abia, Uyo Wednesday during the commissioning of the Special Protection Unit base in Onna local government area of the state.\n\nHe said the Nigeria Police must work with time and modernity to contain the ever dynamic crime waves, adding that training and retraining had been the cardinal point of the present administration.\n\nBaba said: \u201cCrime and criminality is a dynamic thing; it is not something that is static. It moves with time, it moves with modernisation, it moves with technology. Nobody has ever told us that human beings can be stolen; now we see human beings being stolen and taken away and they\u2019re asking you to bring money. That is new crime which is called kidnapping. We know of armed robbery and now we started hearing of armed banditry.\n\n\u201cSo, we must work with time modernity and therefore one of our cardinal principles in the job now is to train and retrain ourselves. So, training is the cardinal point of our administration. We just started training our 10,000 recruits effective last Monday and we have been able to change the curriculum to reflect modernism.\n\n\u201cSince we came we have gotten a lot, we have just been given 200 brand of Pick Up vehicles that are very strong by the Police Trust Fund. We have made our Air wings very effective, we are proud of putting six helicopters on the air at one time.\n\n\u201cOur Marine segment has been reactivated; our Technical Intelligent Unit is working. We have acquired drones, we have digitalised our crime section, we have involved a lot of technology in our works,\u201d the IGP said.\n\nHe encouraged police officers to constantly educate themselves by reading and listening to news on in order to acquaint themselves with latest happenings in the society.\n\nThe IGP, however, lamented that before the launch of Operation Restore Peace to the South-East, the secessionists had demoralised the workforce with unprovoked attacks and killings, adding that the force is working tirelessly to equip itself with tools to aid operations.\n\nIn his remarks, the state Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, lauded the IGP for his result-oriented policies which are in line with global best practices.\n\nHe said though there had been unprovoked attacks since he assumed office as the 30th CP, the measures he initiated by re-jigging the security apparatuses of the state has started yielding fruits.\n\nAmiengheme commended the collaboration between the Nigeria Police and the support of the state government in fighting crime and prevention in the state.\n\n\u201cSince we assumed office, we have been able to re-jig the security apparatuses of the state and that is yielding results in the state. Some of our men are still in the affected areas\u201d the CP said.\n\nSenate urges military\n\nIn a related development, the Senate Wednesday urged the military and security agencies in the country to closely monitor and block the escape routes used by bandits and fleeing terrorists to forestall their relocation to safe havens in other parts of Niger state and the country.\n\nThis was just as it urged the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide food and other livelihood support amenities to affected villages and those internally displaced in Mariga, Mashegu, Kontagora and Borgu Local Government Areas in Niger North Senatorial District.\n\nThese formed part of resolutions reached by the Senate following a motion on \u201cRenewed kidnappings and Banditry Attacks on Communities in Mariga, Mashegu, Kontagora and Borgu Local Government Areas of Niger North Senatorial District.\u201d\n\nComing under Order 41 and 51 of the new Senate Standing Orders, the Deputy Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, bemoaned the disturbing trend of renewed kidnappings and banditry communities of Mariga, Mashegu and Kontagora local government areas of the state.\n\nRecalling the dastardly act, he said: \u201cFollowing the massive onslaught against criminal elements and bandits operating in eastern parts of Sokoto State and Zamfara, there was massive movement of these escaping bandits and their criminal elements into Niger State and specifically into Mariga local government area of Niger State.\n\n\u201cConcerned that these bandits continuously attacked communities in Mariga LGA leading to massive internal displacement of many communities. Currently Villagers have moved out of Ma\u00dandu, Alabani, Sappaji in Berri Ward; over twenty villages are now empty in Galma/Wamba ward and scanty residents in Ukuru, Igoma, Maruba and Ruka villages in Bobbi Ward.\n\n\u201cCommunities that border Kaduna, Zamfara and Kebbi States located in Mariga LGA namely Galma, Makici, Makogi Na Maforo, Nassarawa, and Kwanan Duci are constantly being attacked by bandits and over 15 persons killed in Bobbi ward of Mariga LGA.\n\n\u201cDisturbed that some notorious bandits in their numbers operated for hours in five villages on Friday, 14 January, 2022, where several cattle were rustled as villagers fled their homes.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe bandits first attacked Tungan-Ru\u00e1 village in the morning, later moved to Tungan Maje and also rustled cattle.\n\n\u201cThe same day they attacked Kawo Mashegu where two people were killed, four persons abducted and proceeded to attack Tungan Magaji village where several cattle were also taken away.\n\n\u201cAfter several operations, 17 persons were abducted including two persons delivering ransom. The same day Farin Shinge village a few kilometres\u2019 away from Kontagora town was also attacked and two persons kidnapped.\n\n\u201cWorried that the bandits are in the habit of burning down villages, burning farms with agricultural produce unharvested, stealing the home stored foods of villages they attack with the danger of those who brave the odds to go to their farms for harvest being killed or kidnapped. Many villagers are now IDPS in places like Bangi, Mangoro and other safer locations with no food or amenities for their livelihoods;\n\n\u201cFurther recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered the nation\u2019s armed forces for a major military operation in Niger State which has faced continued attacks on its communities by bandits and remnants of Boko Haram terrorists fleeing theatres of war in the Northwestern and Northeastern parts of the country;\n\n\u201cStrongly suggest that the operations should be comprehensive enough to close the various paths that give the bandits and fleeing terrorists access to safe havens in various parts of Niger State especially in Mariga, Mashegu, Magama and Borgu Local Governments of Niger North Senatorial Districts and Rafi and Shiroro Local Governments of Niger East Senatorial Districts.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Senate resolved to observe a one-minute silence for those who lost their lives.\n\nResolutions\n\nIt urged the armed forces and other security agencies involved in the ordered operations to closely monitor and block the escape paths/routes used by the bandits and fleeing terrorists to forestall their relocation to safe havens in other parts of Niger state.\n\nThe chamber also urged the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide food and other livelihood support amenities to affected villages and those who now IDPS in Mariga, Mashegu, Kontagora and Borgu local government areas of Niger North Senatorial District.",

          "text": "The National Assembly has re-amended the Electoral Act Amendment Bill on Wednesday and approved both direct and indirect primaries.\n\nBoth chambers made the re-amendment in separate plenary sessions. In the Senate, the lawmakers also added the consensus clause for the nomination of candidates by political parties for elective positions.\n\nIn a statement, the upper chamber equally noted that \u201ca political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party\u201d.\n\nOn Clause 84(4), it read that \u201ca political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below; (a) In the case of nominations to the position of Presidential candidate, a political party shall, (i) hold special conventions in each of the 36 states of the federation and FCT, where delegates shall vote for each of the aspirants at designated centers in each State Capital on specified dates.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nElectoral Bill: State Governors Not Against Direct Primaries \u2013 Governor Sule\n\nBuhari Withholds Assent To Electoral Act Amendment\n\nAPC Scuttled Electoral Act Amendment For Fear Of 2023, PDP Claims\n\nBut at the House of Representatives, the legislators removed the consensus option.\n\nThey had gone into a closed-door session after which the chamber became rowdy. The reason for this was, however, not known as the lawmakers gathered in clusters.\n\nWednesday\u2019s move is the latest in the series of events that have trailed President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decline of assent to the bill.\n\nIn December, President Buhari had written to the National Assembly, informing them of his decision to decline assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nIn the letter, the Nigerian leader had cited the direct primaries clause as a major reason for his decision.\n\nHe explained that while the inclusion of the clause is anti-democratic, it is also expensive to execute.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections,\u201d the Nigerian leader added.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterized by freedom of choices.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since membership of political parties is voluntary, and millions of Nigerians are not card-carrying members of any party, the emphasis should be on enabling citizens to vote for the candidates of their choice during elections.\n\nThe President\u2019s action caused ripples across the political space. Some High-profile personalities and the leading opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) had faulted the development.\n\nIn a statement, the PDP accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of plotting to rig the 2023 elections, describing Buhari\u2019s action as a \u201cscript to put Nigerians under perpetual bondage\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaving been rejected for its failures and having also self-decimated its structure across the country, the APC has completely lost the capacity and goodwill for an electoral contest and as such, seeks every means to subvert any process that can guarantee credible elections in 2023,\u201d the party explained.\n\nAside from political parties, civil society organisations had also raised concerns about some \u201cerrors\u201d in the bill just as several governors including Abdullahi Sule had dismissed claims that they were against the direct primaries clause.\n\nThe Nasarawa State leader told Channels Television Sunday Politics that the governors are not against direct primaries.\n\n\u201cIt is not that the state governors are against direct. All we said was that why don\u2019t you leave the options,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act is far more than just direct or indirect. There are so many important things there, why are we boxing ourselves with either direct or indirect?\u201d",

But Nigeria were not sure if they had extended the lead until the Video Assistant Referee confirmed a second goal.\n\nAgain, Eguavoen substituted Tyronne Ebuehi for Olisa Ndah while Henry Onyekuru replaced Iheanacho with just 25 minutes left till the end of the match.\n\nThe three-time African champions went on to maintain the lead until the referee blew the final whistle.\n\nAs if he knew Nigeria would defeat Guinea-Bissau, President Muhammadu Buhari, shortly after the match ended, commended the Super Eagles for keeping hope alive by winning all their group matches and advancing to the second round of the tournament in grand style.\n\nHe, however, urged the team to maintain and even surpass the terrific form that made them leaders in the group stage, saying the people hopefully look forward to a total of seven emphatic wins in the competition.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari trusts that the positive reputation of good sportsmanship the traveling fans, sportswriters, and the football team have demonstrated in Cameroon will continue to enliven the importance of sports, particularly football, as an enabler of development, peace, tolerance, friendship and cooperation,\u201d said a statement by the President\u2019s media adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\nHe wished the Super Eagles the very best, pledging that his administration would continue to support the efforts of international, regional, and national football organisations to use the sport as a tool to build a better and more peaceful world.",

We have seen our beautiful white and red trains. Coincidentally, the rail line is called Red Line and you can see they have given us the colour. We are just going to brand it and put up our seal there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hope that this (purchase of the trains) will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial business relationship. Providing source of livelihood for our citizens is all about providing jobs for our people and that is what we are doing. It is about ensuring that we can build our economy; people can move from one location to another, and businesses can grow.\n\n\u201cPart of what we have done in the last two and half years is to have what we call Integrated Urban Mass transportation system, where we will be using road infrastructure, waterway infrastructure, and rail infrastructure so that we can move over 20 million Lagosians within and around the city.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu said his team was in Milwaukee to see things for themselves in respect of the purchase of the trains, adding that they have inspected the trains, seen their configuration, and were satisfied that they fit into the tracks of the Red Line in Lagos.\n\nHe gave an assurance that the first phase of the Red Line would begin by the last quarter of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023, with a capacity of 500,000 passengers daily.\n\nThe acting Milwaukee Mayor, Cavalier Johnson, who received Governor Sanwo-Olu in the city, said \u201cIt is a little bittersweet.\n\n\u201cI am sending my congratulations to the Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria, but also a little disappointed that we missed out on the opportunity to have those train sets operating here in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nFor the CEO and President of Talgo, USA, Antonio Perez, it is important that the trains are utilised and it does not make any good for them to be stored and kept without passengers riding them.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu was accompanied by the Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde; his Special Adviser on Works, Aramide Adeyoye, and Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), Abimbola Akinajo.",

          "text": "Airlines across the world, including the long-haul carrier Emirates, rushed Wednesday to cancel or change flights heading into the U.S. over an ongoing dispute about the rollout of 5G mobile phone technology near American airports.\n\nThe issue appeared to impact the Boeing 777, a long-range, wide-body aircraft used by carriers across the world. Two Japanese airlines directly named the aircraft as being particularly affected by the 5G signals as they announced cancellations and changes to their schedules.\n\nDubai-based Emirates, a key carrier for East-West travel, announced it would halt flights to Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, New Jersey, Orlando, Florida, San Francisco and Seattle over the issue beginning Wednesday. It said it would continue flights to Los Angeles, New York and Washington.\n\nIn its announcement, Emirates cited the cancellation as necessary due to \u201coperational concerns associated with the planned deployment of 5G mobile network services in the U.S. at certain airports.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns, and we hope to resume our U.S. services as soon as possible,\u201d the state-owned airline said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates successfully rolled out 5G coverage all around its airports without incident. But in the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration worries that the C-Band strand of 5G could interfere with aviation equipment.\n\nOf particular concern in the 5G rollout appears to be the Boeing 777, a major workhorse for Emirates.\n\nJapan\u2019s All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. said in a statement that the FAA \u201chas indicated that radio waves from the 5G wireless service may interfere with aircraft altimeters.\u201d Altimeters measure how high a plane is in the sky, a crucial piece of equipment for flying.\n\n\u201cBoeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft, and we have cancelled or changed the aircraft for some flights to/from the U.S. based on the announcement by Boeing,\u201d ANA said.\n\nJapan Airlines Co. Ltd. similarly said that it had been informed that 5G signals \u201cmay interfere with the radio altimeter installed on the Boeing 777.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will refrain from using this model on the continental United States line until we can confirm its safety and we regret to inform you that we will cancel the flight for which the aircraft cannot be changed to the Boeing 787,\u201d the airline said.\n\nChicago-based Boeing Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAir India also announced on Twitter it would cancel flights to Chicago, Newark, New York and San Francisco \u201cdue to deployment of the 5G communications\u201d equipment. It said it would try to use other aircraft on U.S. routes as well.\n\nThe cancellations come even after mobile phone carriers AT&T and Verizon will postpone new wireless service near some U.S. airports planned for this week.\n\nThe FAA will allow planes with accurate, reliable altimeters to operate around high-power 5G. But planes with older altimeters will not be allowed to make landings under low-visibility conditions.",

          "text": "The New York attorney general\u2019s office late Tuesday told a court its investigators had uncovered evidence that former President Donald Trump\u2019s company used \u201cfraudulent or misleading\u201d asset valuations to get loans and tax benefits.\n\nThe court filing said state authorities haven\u2019t yet decided whether to bring a civil lawsuit in connection with the allegations, but that investigators need to question Trump and his two eldest children as part of the probe.\n\nTrump and his lawyers say the investigation is politically motivated.\n\nIn the court documents, Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office gave its most detailed accounting yet of a long-running investigation of allegations that Trump\u2019s company exaggerated the value of assets to get favorable loan terms, or misstated what land was worth to slash its tax burden.\n\nThe Trump Organization, it said, had overstated the value of land donations made in New York and California on paperwork submitted to the IRS to justify several million dollars in tax deductions.\n\nThe company misreported the size of Trump\u2019s Manhattan penthouse, saying it was nearly three times its actual size \u2014 a difference in value of about $200 million, James\u2019 office said, citing deposition testimony from Trump\u2019s longtime financial chief Allen Weisselberg, who was charged last year with tax fraud in a parallel criminal investigation.\n\nJames\u2019 office detailed its findings in a court motion seeking to force Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. to comply with subpoenas seeking their testimony.\n\nInvestigators, the court papers said, had \u201cdeveloped significant additional evidence indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions.\u201d\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with lawyers for the Trumps.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team has sought to block the subpoenas, calling them \u201can unprecedented and unconstitutional maneuver.\u201d They say James is improperly attempting to obtain testimony that could be used in the parallel criminal investigation, being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nTrump sued James in federal court last month, seeking to put an end to her investigation. In the suit, his lawyers claimed the attorney general, a Democrat, had violated the Republican\u2019s constitutional rights in a \u201cthinly-veiled effort to publicly malign Trump and his associates.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the Republican ex-president has decried James\u2019 investigation and Bragg\u2019s probe as part of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, James office said that it hasn\u2019t decided whether to pursue legal action, but said the evidence gathered so far shows the investigation should proceed unimpeded.\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, the Trump Organization has used delay tactics and litigation in an attempt to thwart a legitimate investigation into its financial dealings,\u201d James said. \u201cThus far in our investigation, we have uncovered significant evidence that suggests Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization falsely and fraudulently valued multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for economic benefit.\u201d\n\nAlthough James\u2019 civil investigation is separate from the criminal investigation, her office has been involved in both, dispatching several lawyers to work side-by-side with prosecutors from the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office.\n\nJames\u2019 office said that under state law, it could seek \u201da broad range of remedies\u201d against companies found to have committed commercial fraud, \u201cincluding revoking a license to conduct business within the state, moving to have an officer or director removed from board of directors, and restitution and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.\u201d\n\nIn the court papers, James\u2019 office said evidence shows that Trump\u2019s company:\n\n\u2014 Listed his Seven Springs estate north of New York City as being worth $291 million, based on the dubious assumption that it could reap $161 million from building nine luxury homes.\n\n\u2014 Added a \u201cbrand premium\u201d of 15% to 30% to the value of some properties because they carried the Trump name, despite financial statements explicitly stating they didn\u2019t incorporate brand value.\n\n\u2014 Inflated the value of a suburban New York golf club by millions of dollars by counting fees for memberships that weren\u2019t sold or were never paid.\n\n\u2014 Valued a Park Avenue condominium tower at $350 million, based on proceeds it could reap from unsold units, even though many of those apartments were likely to sell for less because they were covered by rent stabilization laws.\n\n\u2014 Valued an apartment being rented to Ivanka Trump at as high as $25 million, even though she had an option to buy it for $8.5 million.\n\n\u2014 Said in documents that its stake in an office building, 40 Wall Street, was worth $525 million to $602 million \u2014 between two to three times the estimate reached by appraisers working for the lender Capital One.\n\nOne judge has previously sided with James on an earlier request to question another Trump son, Trump Organization executive Eric Trump, who ultimately sat for a deposition but declined to answer some questions.\n\nLast year, the Manhattan district attorney brought tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Weisselberg, its longtime chief financial officer.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he and the company evaded taxes on lucrative fringe benefits paid to executives.\n\nBoth investigations are at least partly related to allegations made in news reports and by Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, that Trump had a history of misrepresenting the value of assets.\n\nThe disclosures about the attorney general\u2019s investigation came the same day as Trump ally Rudy Giuliani and other members of the legal team that had sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election were subpoenaed by a House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
