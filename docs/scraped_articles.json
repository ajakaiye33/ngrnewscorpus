          "text": "By Sola Isola\n\nMystery, each time it happens, makes history. The rich history of Africa rides so much on some of the historic happenings and events that have occurred.\n\nOne of such cases is what the Saabo Community, Oyo town in Oyo state witnessed on Monday, 4th of October 2021, at about 6:30 pm when a tree, popularly referred to as \u2018Igi Odan\u2019 fell due to a heavy windstorm.\n\nThe tree was said to have been planted about a hundred years ago by a sango worshipper, Sangoleke Ojelabi.\n\nThe bizarre sight had turned the scene into a tourist attraction as residents trooped to the place to see the reported wonder.\n\nThis development has raised an ongoing conversation between divinity, science and mystery.\n\nIt was, however, learned that Ojelabi did not plant the tree for worshipping any deity but to provide shade for people.\n\nThe tree, which is close to a popular foodstuffs market served as a relaxation spot for motorcycle riders, shuttle buses operators as well as traders, killed four people and left one other person injured.\n\nA woman, who came to the market with her child to buy meat, under the tree, got trapped under the tree when the tree fell even though the meat seller escaped with some injuries.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the Federal College of Education, SPED, Onifade Kafilat lost her life.\n\nOthers who lost their lives are; Bose Taiwo; Abdul-Yekin Aduroti-Allah and a 13-year-old bot identified as Dare.\n\nThe only injured victim was identified as Soliu.\n\nBodies of the dead were later recovered after four saw millers had tried in vain to cut the branches.\n\nBotched attempts to cut down tree\n\nThe Chairman of Saabo Market in Oyo, Alhaji Akeebu Alarape, while speaking on the incident explained that the tree has been there for over a hundred years, adding that there have been several failed attempts to cut the tree down.\n\nBut chairman, Sooro LCDA, Mr Seun Oguntona, who debunked the rumour that the tree was fetish, advised people not to take shelter under any tree when it rains.\n\nHe added that the man who planted the tree died about 30 years ago adding that though the man worshipped Sango while alive, the purpose of planting the tree was to provide shade for people.\n\nResidents of the community were left in awe when on Tuesday 5th September, at about 6:30 pm, the leftover trunk of the tree stood up again, almost exactly after 24hours.\n\nA resident, Wasiu Kareem said: \u201cWhat baffles all of us about the tree is that it stood up at the exact time it fell.\u201d\n\nAlso corroborating Wasiu\u2019s claim, a driver, Saheed Balogun, who witnessed the incident, explained that he was loading his vehicle at the park not far from the tree when there was loud vibration from the tree and it went back to its standing position.\n\nBalogun said: \u201cIt happened in my presence. I was loading my car and then the tree started shaking, next thing, it stood up again.\u201d\n\nPictures and video taken at the scene of the event had confirmed earlier that the tree was uprooted and its branches trimmed.\n\nWhen Vanguard visited the scene of the incident, it was observed that the tree trunk stood exactly where it fell.\n\nA resident, who pleaded anonymity, said that after the tree fell, a calabash was seen under the tree and that later in the evening, an unidentified man drove to the scene and took the calabash away.\n\nHe said that immediately after the fall and rise of the tree, many individuals, who believed it was not a natural occurrence, had flooded the scene to sprinkle salt on it, while others built a barricade around it, with a white cloth.\n\nAlaafin visits scene\n\nHowever, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III while at the scene of the event ordered that the barricade be pulled down and nothing be done to the tree.\n\nThe Alaafin said: \u201cIn the days of old, our forefathers used trees to demarcate family compounds, communities, territories, borders and used traditional rites and spiritual powers to protect them against any incursion or invasion and some serve as points of the family deity.\n\n\u201cThe location of this tree is at a junction (orita) in Sabo Market, but before the area was filled with bushes, it was an entry point to Oyo called Abata Emo. As is always the practice in ancient times, traditional rites and spiritual powers were put at the tree spot to prevent incursions into the town. The families of those late Sango priests, who held a vigil in the area, have related the history of their forefathers and the tree.\n\n\u201cPresently, the family of the late Baba Sangoleke Ojelabi still lives there and they are the caretakers of the area.\n\n\u201cOnly our ancestors could have the answer. Today, many of our youths and families have embraced the other religions and have abandoned our ancient practices hence there is a dearth of knowledge of the significance of some trees. There are trees and there are trees; in Yorubaland, we all know every tree has its story. They are indicators of divinations but let us be guided, we must accept the fact that we cannot explain everything by science.\n\n\u201cEvery family has its deity, we should not just allow modernisation and supposed civilization and their complications get the best of us, all the people who take roots and herbs understand the efficacy of those herbs irrespective of the facts that we have many hospitals which only can treat things that they perceive they can see.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to spirituality, we all know that the drugs prescribed by doctors and scientific knowledge have limits. We should not because of our new religious ideologies belittle our culture and tradition when in other climes they are preserving theirs.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery about the tree\u2014 Baba Sango\u2019s son\n\nAlso speaking, one of the sons of the late Baba Sango, Babatunde, said that he saw on Facebook that someone said he removed a pot from a part of the felled tree.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur late mother, many years ago, put a pot beside the tree.\n\n\u201cShe was always pouring water in it so that passers-by, who might be thirsty, could scoop water from it and drink.\n\n\u201cAfter many years, the creepers that grew from the branches encumbered the pot and so it was no longer visible. It was the pot that had been swallowed by the trunk of the now very big tree that the Facebook man said he removed from the tree.\n\n\u201cThere is no mystery at all about the tree. Our father did not do anything supernatural to the tree till he died.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Alago of Ago Oja Land, Chief Ganiyu Busari, said that the fall and rise of the tree was a mystery and mythical one, adding that the tree had been beneficial to the people for ages based on the spiritual power that late Baba Sango must have infused in the tree.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, one of Baba Adeleke\u2019s sons, Mr. Munmini, countered Alago Oja\u2019s claim, saying: \u201cI was not surprised at what happened. I cautioned those cutting the branches of the tree that people around should be driven away because the tree would return to its base.\n\n\u201cI told them that the load on top of the tree, which held it lying down, was being relieved as the branches were being clipped off. I told them that the load in the base of the tree would eventually pull the tree back when the upper part becomes much lighter.\u201d",

INEC has posited that it has the capacity and the ability to conduct electronic voting and the transmission of results from the polling units in the entire country electronically.\n\n\u201cWe, however, wish to commend the Nigerian people for their doggedness and their insistence on the need for the National Assembly to guarantee, through the laws of the land, the necessary legal frameworks that will permit INEC to deploy technology towards ensuring a credible electoral process.\n\n\u201cThis has shown again that power truly belongs to the people when the people come together and make demands from those entrusted with leadership and governance.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to look forward to the end of this electoral legislative journey, where the President will assent to the bill and it becomes law, we shall be launching a coordinating committee of the non-partisan political coalition on electoral reforms under the leadership of Prof Attahiru Jega and Dr Olisa Agbakoba.\n\n\u201cWe wish to use this medium to reiterate to Nigerians that people\u2019s power is supreme in all circumstances of human endeavour if well mobilised and explored. So, when we come together to chart forward the direction that our society should go and unite on the demands from leaders to do what is needed, nothing can stop us.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that political parties cannot be gagged into adopting one single way of producing their party candidates i.e. direct primary. All political parties are not the same and so it is wrong to subject them to a one-way system of producing their candidates.\n\n\u201cThe National Consultative Front will like to appreciate the support from Nigerians so far on its historical mission to save and rescue Nigeria from failed exploitative leadership and for standing up and putting pressure on the Federal Government collectively as we again look forward to the President\u2019s assent and the implementation of the new law by all stakeholders.\u201d",

A Conservative oil price benchmark of 57 US Dollars per barrel; daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day); exchange rate of four 410.15 per US Dollar; and projected GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent and 13 percent inflation rate.\n\n\u201cBased on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue is estimated at N17.70 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cTotal federally distributable revenue is estimated at N12.72 trillion in 2022 while total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at N10.13 trillion. This includes Grants and Aid of N63.38 billion , as well as the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises.\n\n\u201cOil revenue is projected at N3.16 trillion, Non-oil taxes are estimated at N2.13 trillion and FGN Independent revenues are projected to be N1.82 trillion .\u201d\n\nIn any case, Senior Research Analyst at FXTM, Senior Research Analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, who raised hope on continued stability in oil prices, said: \u201cOne of the major themes dominating global markets is the recent surge in oil prices.\n\n\u201cBrent and WTI crude have appreciated to multiyear highs this month thanks to the combination of tightening supplies and rising demand. The explosive appreciation in oil is bad news for energy consumers but a welcome development for energy-producing countries like Nigeria which acquires over 90% of export earnings and roughly 70% of government earnings from oil sales.\u201d",

In 2021, a little over five years after the Promise of Paris, Climate Change conversations have shifted to clear-cut verifiable, and ambitious actions to tackle Climate Change.\n\nPresident Buhari approves Nigeria\u2019s revised National Climate Change Policy\n\n\u201cThe administration of President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR has since his Inaugural Address on May 29, 2015, shown commitment to tackle Climate Change. This, Mr. President, has shown in his many assertions at Climate Change conferences and other international meetings. Mr. President has also gone further to show action by approving the revised National Climate Change Policy of Nigeria, this year.\n\n\u201cAs legislators, it is our duty to complement the efforts of the executive through oversight, or by making laws that will help realize the goals and visions of Government. This was what gave birth to the Climate Change Bill which I sponsored. The Bill seeks to provide legal backing to Nigeria\u2019s efforts to mainstream Climate Change actions into the country\u2019s sustainable development plans. Thankfully, through the combined efforts of the legislature and the executive, the Bill was reviewed and on July 8, 2021, it was passed by the House of Representatives. Immediately afterward, it went through First Reading at the Senate on July 14, 2021.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that the Bill has yesterday, October 13, 2021, been given concurrence by the Senate. It will now be transmitted to President Buhari for assent\u201d.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Senate had on Wednesday passed the Climate Change Bill into law.\n\nThis followed barely after two months the House of Representatives had equally passed the same bill into law.\n\nThe bill seeks to provide legal backing to Nigeria\u2019s efforts to mainstream climate change actions into the country\u2019s sustainable development plan.\n\nThe passed Climate Change Bill will now be transmitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent, as the constitution demands.",

He was remanded in prison custody in Cotonou pending the final determination of his case on how he entered the neighbouring country.\n\nHis two counsel in Nigeria and Benin Republic, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN) and Prof Ibrahim Salami, confirmed the deterioration of his health and the need for urgent medical treatment abroad.\n\nAlliyu said reports available to him was that one of his Igboho\u2019s organs might have been affected as a result of injury he sustained when he reportedly fell while attempting to escape from DSS officials who invaded his Ibadan residence.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, slammed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for condemning the Senate\u2019s amendment of the Electoral Bill on Tuesday to allow political parties hold only direct primaries.\n\nAccording to the APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, PDP is only pretending to be an opposition political party.\n\nThe senate had reconsidered its decision on some clauses in the Electoral Amendment Bill that were passed in July.The Senate amended clause 87 of the bill to mandate political parties to hold only direct primaries for candidates seeking elective positions, which the PDP was opposed to. It also amended the clause to let the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) determine the use of electronic voting and transfer of election results.\n\nAkpanudoedehe while affirming the APC\u2019s support for the Senate\u2019s amendments, said the party would support constitutionally-permitted innovations that would improve transparency and credibility of the country\u2019s electioneering processes and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the sound bites from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should be ignored in its entirety. PDP is only pretending to be an opposition political party. Meanwhile, the patriotic disposition of the multi-partisan 9th National Assembly should be commended. It is the right thing for the National Assembly to aggregate and consider the clamour by civil societies, interested stakeholders and indeed all Nigerians on all matters requiring legislation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC scribe said in line with the party\u2019s progressive mantra, the credibility of elections had continued to improve under the President Buhari-led APC government.\n\nHe said valid votes now count and past practices of electoral fraud inflicted on Nigerians were fast becoming a thing of the past.\n\nHe said at party level, the APC CECPC, under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni, had entrenched internal democracy.\n\nThis, he said, was especially in its nomination processes as recorded in recent and successful nationwide congresses conducted by the party.\n\nHe assured that the APC as a party and government, would continue to stand for and support free, fair, transparent and credible elections across the country.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the PDP accused the APC of destroying the country\u2019s electoral process.\n\nThe PDP, which was reacting to a statement by the APC urging Nigerians to ignore its concern over the introduction of direct primaries into the electoral law, by the Senate, said it was not true that the ruling party has improved the electoral process.\n\nThe opposition party, in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged the APC to accept its failure in governance.\n\n\u201cOur position is predicated on a statement by the APC in which it claimed to have improved on electoral process in the country, whereas what abounds in our nation is a painful story of how the APC has destroyed our economy, our electoral process and our national unity, to the extent that life has become despondent to the average Nigerian.\n\n\u201cWe accept the fact that the APC lacks the capacity for feedback mechanism, however, the PDP wishes to bring to the attention of the APC that all Nigerians today would wish this administration had come to its end.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding, our party counsel that the APC should begin to prepare their handover notes because Nigerians are not ready to endure this anguish beyond May 29, 2023, \u201c the PDP stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC has said nly internal bickering and disunity within its ranks can stop it from retaining power in 2023.\n\nIt appealed to aggrieved members that their inability to eschew bickering and misunderstanding would pose serious threat to the quest to retain power beyond 2023.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of the state congresses committees in Abuja, Akpanudoedehe urged aggrieved members to explore the reconciliation window endorsed by President Muhammadu Buhari to ventilate their grievances and achieve unity.\n\nThe party scribe admitted difficulties in managing a nuclear family, let alone a large political party like the APC with over 40 million members, urging members to applaud efforts by the National Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni in proper management of the party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

An appropriate service wide advisory/circular will be issued to guide the process.\u201d\n\nMustapha also advised Nigerians to increase vigilance during the festive period.\n\n\u201cStatistics generated over the last four weeks on testing have shown that the trend of infection is going down in some states, while in others, the trajectory is upward. The combined total for testing by PCR and RDT now stands at about 3.141, 795 million persons. Aviation authorities in collaboration with the diplomatic sector have made reasonable progress in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Discussions are still on-going with the UAE authorities to resolve the impasse.

This is because African countries have found it difficult to access the vaccines for their citizens in sufficient number.\n\n\u201cOver several months, four countries were placed on high level restriction for travellers from such countries. The PSC has after a review of the developments in these countries, decided to remove South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil from the restricted list.

          "text": "\u2022Gives erring agencies one week to appear before relevant committees\n\n\u2022Appropriation bill passes second reading, plenary suspended till Nov. 9\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, yesterday raised the alarm over alleged sabotage of the President Muhammadu Buhari government\u2019s effort to provide critical infrastructure in the country by some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Lawan gave those he identified as erring MDAs one week to appear before the relevant committees of the upper chamber or face the wrath of the law.\n\nHe said despite several invitations extended to them by the Local and Foreign Debt Committee of the Senate, the MDAs had consistently refused to appear to justify projects listed for funding through the loan requests sought by Buhari.\n\nReacting to the refusal by MDAs to justify some listed projects, Lawan described their action as an act of sabotage that would not be condoned by the National Assembly. He listed the erring MDAs to include the Federal Ministry of Power, Federal Ministry of Heath, Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure, Federal Ministry of Water Resources, and Federal Ministry of Environment.\n\nLawan said some ministries and agencies of the federal government that should have appeared before the Senate Committee on a Loan and Foreign Debts to defend the debt request by the executive arm of government had failed to appear.\n\n\u201cThe senate considers this attitude as a sabotage to the effort of the federal government to secure the loans and fund the infrastructural development that this country desperately needs,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nHe added, \u201cAlready, the National Assembly has approved the loan request, but there is need for justification.\n\n\u201cI will, therefore, call the names of these MDAs, and we are giving them just one week to appear before the Committee on Loan and Foreign Debts.\n\n\u201cIf they fail to appear, we will take appropriate and prompt action, because this senate will not condone any sabotage to the efforts of this administration to provide infrastructure to this country.\u201d\n\nThe senate had on July 15 approved Buhari\u2019s external loan request to the tune of $8,325,526,537 and \u20ac490,000,000 under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan.\n\nThe president Buhari had in another request contained in a letter read on September 14 sought the approval of the senate to borrow an additional sum of $4,054,476,863 and \u20ac710 million Euros.\n\nBuhari explained that the loans were needed to fund projects listed in the addendum to the 2018 to 2021 federal government external borrowing plan.\n\nAccording to him, the projects are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency, China Exim Bank, International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), Credit Swiss Group, and Standard Chartered, in the credit total sum of $4.5 billion, 710 million euros and grant component of $125 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the senate yesterday suspended plenary till November 9 after it passed for second reading the 2022 Appropriation Bill presented by President Muhammadu Buhari last Thursday.\n\nThe upper chamber took the decision to suspend plenary for close to one month to allow its committees begin 2022 budget defense sessions with heads of MDAs. It suspended sitting after concluding debate on the general principles of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, which began on Tuesday.\n\nNo fewer than 42 senators took turns to make their contributions during the second and final day of debate on the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nContributors included Senators Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Adelere Oriolowo, Patrick Akinyelure, Ibrahim Gobir, Smart Adeyemi, Ibrahim Abdullahi, George Thompson Sekibo, Christopher Ekpenyong, Betty Apiafi, Mohammed Musa, Michael Opeyemi Bamidele, Michael Nnachi, and Yahaya Oloriegbe.\n\nOthers were Matthew Urhoghide, Francis Fadahunsi, Mukhail Adetokunbo Abiru, Anayo Rochas Okorocha, Oyelola Ashiru, Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe, Hezekiah Dimka, Binos Dauda Yaroe, Chukwuma Frank Ibezim, Olalekan Mustapha, Chukwuka Utazi, Abba Patrick Moro, Danladi Sankara, and Isah Jibrin.\n\nIn his contribution, Danbaba underscored the need for the federal government to include Public-Private Partnership as a way to fund the provision of critical infrastructure needed for economic development.\n\nAdeyemi called for the urgent diversification of the economy through mining, adding that there are abundant mineral resources yet to be exploited by the federal government.\n\nSekibo advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to come up with policies that would help stabilise the country\u2019s exchange rate over a period of time. He lamented that the implementation of capital projects in the 2022 budget proposal were tied to borrowing.\n\nIn his contribution, Ekpenyong called for the scrutiny and tinkering of the budget estimates by the National Assembly, to ensure that it reflected the needs and met the expectations of Nigerians.\n\nOn her part, Apiafi protested the exclusion of some states as beneficiaries of the loan to be sourced by the federal government. According to her, some states, such as Rivers, do not stand to benefit from the loan through projects, but are among those to repay the loan obtained by Nigeria.\n\nShe also called on the federal government to give special attention to the power sector, adding that doing so would attract and promote private investments.\n\nMusa said the 2022 budget outlook was good, saying, \u201cNigeria\u2019s debt level is sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe urged the federal government to ensure that borrowed funds were applied to critical projects.\n\nAccording to him, more attention should be given to revenue generation and the country\u2019s tax framework.\n\nAfter scaling second reading, Lawan referred the 2022 Appropriation Bill to the Committee on Appropriations for further legislative work.\n\nThe committee, which is chaired by Senator Jibrin Barau, was given four weeks to report back to plenary.\n\nLawan, in his concluding remarks said, \u201cI want to also appreciate senators for the sacrifice in processing, consideration and passage of the 2020 and 2021 Appropriation Acts. That devotion, commitment and dedication certainly saw us succeed in passing the previous bills.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that we are ready to repeat the feat of passing the Appropriation Bill 2022 before the end of December.\n\n\u201cDistinguished colleagues, I agree with those of us who raised the issue of revenue generation, collection and remittances to the coffers of the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe agencies that are supposed to collect and remit revenues would have to be tasked, and this 2022 Appropriation Bill shows we have over 400 billion coming, especially from these agencies as additional revenues. We need to do better.\n\n\u201cGovernment agencies must remit revenues that they generate. We need to also invest in our people, dedication for our youth particularly and, of course, health.\u201d\n\nLawan said borrowing was not bad. \u201cWhat we need to do is to ensure that what we borrow is prudently deployed in those areas of capital infrastructural development,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reads riot act to personnel, worried about reports of misconduct\n\n\u2022 State now ripe for taking by PDP, says Okowa\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nAhead of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday, ordered commanders of the Police Mobile Force (MOPOL) to deal ruthlessly with violent elements and political thugs, who might work against a transparent and credible election in the state.\n\nBaba read the riot act to the squadron commanders and vowed to deal with any commander found to be lacking capacity or will to key into his reform agenda. He expressed worry over reports of misconducts by some police personnel in the country.\n\nBut speaking on the Anambra election, Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, said the time had come for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to add the South-east state to the list of states controlled by the main opposition party by winning the November 6 election, the same way it took Edo State in 2020.\n\nBaba, who spoke at a meeting with MOPOL Squadron Commanders in Abuja, said the election security action plan would revolve around police mobile units.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAs you are aware, the Anambra State gubernatorial election will hold on 6th of November, 2021. The election security action plan will, as usual, revolve around units of the Mobile Police Force.\n\n\u201cThe import of this is that the task of securing our democratic values and guaranteeing a safe, secure and credible electoral process in Anambra State will rest squarely and majorly on some of you, the squadron commanders here seated and some of your units.\n\n\u201cMost of your operatives will be deployed to deter subversive elements that are planning to threaten the process, while others will be deployed to secure personnel and materials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as well as other critical national infrastructure.\n\n\u201cYou must remain apolitical while being ruthless with violent elements and ill-guided political thugs that may wish to test our common will to deliver a transparent and credible electoral outcome.\u201d\n\nThe IGP vowed to deal with errant commanders following reports of unprofessional conduct and illegal deployment of personnel.\n\nHe told the MOPOL commanders, \u201cMuch as I am determined to motivate you to advance your mandate as the striking arm of the force, let no one of you be in doubt about my resolve to deal decisively with any squadron commander that lacks command capacity as well as those who are unwilling to key into our mission of reforming the PMF and repositioning the force.\n\n\u201cDiscipline, professionalism and operational excellence are the bedrocks of the PMF. Any personnel that is deficient in any of these has no justification to remain within PMF system, as they are not only dangers to the force but to the nation.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we shall not spare any PMF operative that continues to conduct himself or herself in manners that are not edifying of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the AIG PMF has been directed to put machinery in motion to identify and rationalise such incorrigible elements out of the PMF.\u201d\n\nHe expressed concern about the reports of misconduct by officers and illegal deployment of personnel, saying, \u201cMy dear commanders, while I am pleased with your operational strides, I am also concerned about reports touching on unprofessional conducts by some operatives of the PMF across the country as well as reports of illegal deployment of PMF personnel.\n\n\u201cCitizens of this country are worried about the illegalities of some bad eggs within the fold of PMF as well as the tendency for corruption by some others. These misconducts are direct consequences of supervisory ineptitude by some of you, the squadron commanders.\u201d\n\nOkowa, who hosted the PDP governorship candidate in Anambra State, Mr Valentine Ozigbo, at Government House, Asaba, said there was ample evidence that the party had prepared well to win the election, which is barely three weeks away. The governor welcomed the decision by the National Assembly to endorse electronic voting by supporting the plan by INEC to transmit election results electronically during the 2023 general election, saying it is a good omen for the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe Delta State governor, who is also Deputy Chairman of PDP\u2019s National Campaign Council for the Anambra election, described Ozigbo as \u201chumble and dynamic\u201d, saying he towers above all other candidates in the election. He urged the people of Anambra State to give the party their votes at the election, assuring that the PDP would turn things around for the better in the state.\n\nOkowa said he was particularly happy that the party in Anambra State was now more closely knit in the countdown to the crucial election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI welcome you and your entourage to Delta State and to my office; and, I feel very happy within me, because I can see that we have decided to toe the path of unity. When we are united, I am convinced we will come out victorious in the November 6 governorship election.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate you ahead of time, because I know that you are doing well. There is no doubt that Anambra State has always been a PDP state but, unfortunately, in the past 16 years, we have lost out in the politics of Anambra solely because of the in-fighting.\n\n\u201cBut from what I am hearing and what I can see now, I feel very encouraged that there is a new spirit now in the PDP in Anambra. When people resolve that enough is enough, that they have to do the right thing, you find that the result will truly come because the men, the women and the youths are out there.\n\n\u201cI know that there is a lot of security challenges but that shouldn\u2019t deter us because politicians are strong-willed people. The real politics is not the gathering of people on the field but the door-to-door campaign, which is set out to convince people.\u201d\n\nOkowa said the people of Anambra had \u201cseen the other side of the coin at the moment; they are waiting for the PDP and it is for us to rediscover ourselves or to decide to give away this chance, but I\u2019m convinced that you will not allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nHe said PDP had a good opportunity to take over Anambra State, just like Edo State. \u201cWe may not have a better chance than now, so, we must take it back,\u201d h said.\n\nAccording to Okowa, \u201cWe are reordering not just Anambra but the entire nation, because we have seen too much pain in the last few years and there has been a lot of retrogression and pain caused people. I believe that PDP is in the best position to turn things around, both in Anambra State and nationally.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people seeking the office of governor in Anambra and I have had cause to relate with some of them but I believe our candidate is better than all of them out there. To the APGA Youth Leader that is joining us, we welcome you and we are truly very grateful that you have decided to join this train.\n\n\u201cBeing a leader of youths, this move is very important for us because I know that the youths have a lot of role to play in elections. I also welcome the women here because women make a lot of mark in terms of numbers on the voting day.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he believed the Anambra election would be free, fair and credible election \u201cbecause I know that INEC is fully ready and the device they want to use has been tested in the Delta bye-election and it was very credible.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Ozigbo said he was in Delta State to present the defecting members of APGA to the governor, who is a national leader of the party. He said the people of Anambra State were waiting for PDP to take over.\n\nIn company with Ozigbo were some defectors from All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State, led by the former youth leader in the state, Mr Magnus Eziokwu.\n\nOzigbo, \u201cWe have lots of people coming to join us because they have seen the light and they know the direction that Anambra is going and they know that Anambra is waiting for PDP to take over.\n\n\u201cOur team has what it takes to deliver Anambra to PDP and we will surely make our people proud.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Okowa described as a welcome development and a victory for democracy the U-turn by the federal legislature on the mode of transmission results of future elections in the country. He said the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 by the National Assembly, which empowers INEC to transmit election results electronically, would greatly enhance the electoral process and the credibility of elections.\n\nSpeaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba, Okowa commended the senate for listening to the loud voices of Nigerians by reversing itself and voting to include electronic transmission of results in the amendment of the electoral law.\n\nWhile noting that transmitting election results would greatly eliminate electoral fraud, Okowa said, \u201cLaws are made for the people, not for personal interests, and as such, we must always act in the interest of the public.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenges we are facing today as a nation stems from lack of faith in the electoral process, which has huge implications for socio-economic activity in the country, including foreign direct investments.\n\n\u201cOnce we are able to get the people to have faith in our electoral process, where the people can truly decide, who leads them, part of our problem would have been solved.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended INEC for taking bold steps improve election in the country, saying, \u201cNotable improvement in the electoral process, especially, the recent introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), will guarantee the credibility of voter accreditation by preventing the incidents of multiple voting or the use of stolen PVCs to vote.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They built together and ran pilots in school, getting 500 students to use the product they were bringing to the market. By 2018, 14 months after graduation, they hit one million subscribers. With a little media coverage and a lot of networking, they get a US company to invest $50 million for them to scale. In six months, this unicorn-in-the-making is burnt to debts by new tax rules quietly introduced by the federal government. This is avoidable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2021, Zainab Ahmed, the minister of finance, budget and national planning, approved the Tax Appeal Tribunal (Procedure) rules, 2021. This replaces the 2010 TAT rules, which had a few shortcomings and had become obsolete in some sense.\n\nFor the most part, the new rules are good for businesses; both KPMG and PwC agree that the rules are a reflection of the country\u2019s most recent realities.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the new Rules emphasizes the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to improving Nigeria\u2019s tax landscape,\u201d KPMG\u2019s Wole Obayomi wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor PwC, the rules \u201care intended to make the TAT more efficient in the dispensation of justice. They are also a reflection of the current realities given the wide adoption of technology in the administration of justice\u201d.\n\nThe new rules now recognise service of documents by email or such other electronic means as the Tribunal may permit. It also gives room for virtual or remote hearing of applications and delivery of rulings by the tribunal.\n\nIn addition to all these, it also introduces a six-month timeframe from the date of commencement of trial for the tribunal to conclude and provide a decision on an appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe business killer in the rules\n\nIn the midst of all that good rules is also a potential business killer. According to order 3 rule 6 of the Tax Appeal Tribunal (Procedure) rules, 2021, \u201cfor an appeal against the tax authority, the aggrieved person will pay 50% of the disputed amount into designated account by the Tribunal before hearing as security for prosecuting the appeal\u201d.\n\nIn simpler terms, this means FIRS could simply claim that a company valued at $50 million owes $100 million in unpaid taxes. The company could appeal the decision of the tax authority at the Tax Appeal Tribunal but would need to pay $50 million \u2014 50% of the disputed amount \u2014 as security before the appeal can be heard.\n\nThis also means that if the company does not pay the $50 million, the tribunal will not begin hearing. If the hearing cannot start, there will be no justice, and the tax authority may effectively shut down the business to recover the \u201ctax claim\u201d.\n\nThis would discourage companies from approaching the tribunal for justice, it would encourage them to disobey tax authorities, and would ultimately lead to more damage in the tax landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its advisory about the tax rules, PwC said \u201cthere are concerns that the provision is a bar to access to justice which is contrary to the constitutional rights of fair hearing and a fair trial\u201d.\n\nThe advisory said, \u201cit is inconsistent with similar provisions in the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 which gives the TAT discretion to order payment as security where a taxpayer failed to file returns\u201d.\n\nThat discretion has been taken away from the tribunal as a fixed price has been set to somewhat favour the tax authority \u2014 all the time. KPMG agrees.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of a blanket requirement for taxpayers to make a 50% deposit of disputed amounts to the TAT may act as a clog in the wheels of justice and discourage taxpayers from pursuing recourse from the TAT,\u201d Obayomi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis new tax rule takes the tribunal \u201caway from the less formal dispute resolution framework\u201d it was designed to be.\n\nKPMG asked the minister of finance to consider making the \u201cTAT Rules less litigious or court-like to ensure the TAT maintains its edge as a speedy and non-litigious tax dispute resolution forum\u201d.",

If the hearing cannot start, there will be no justice, and the tax authority may effectively shut down the business to recover the \u201ctax claim\u201d.\n\nThis would discourage companies from approaching the tribunal for justice, it would encourage them to disobey tax authorities, and would ultimately lead to more damage in the tax landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its advisory about the tax rules, PwC said \u201cthere are concerns that the provision is a bar to access to justice which is contrary to the constitutional rights of fair hearing and a fair trial\u201d.\n\nThe advisory said, \u201cit is inconsistent with similar provisions in the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 which gives the TAT discretion to order payment as security where a taxpayer failed to file returns\u201d.\n\nThat discretion has been taken away from the tribunal as a fixed price has been set to somewhat favour the tax authority \u2014 all the time. KPMG agrees.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of a blanket requirement for taxpayers to make a 50% deposit of disputed amounts to the TAT may act as a clog in the wheels of justice and discourage taxpayers from pursuing recourse from the TAT,\u201d Obayomi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis new tax rule takes the tribunal \u201caway from the less formal dispute resolution framework\u201d it was designed to be.\n\nKPMG asked the minister of finance to consider making the \u201cTAT Rules less litigious or court-like to ensure the TAT maintains its edge as a speedy and non-litigious tax dispute resolution forum\u201d.",

          "text": "On Tuesday, the senate approved the direct primary mode for political parties in picking their candidates for elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe provision was made after the upper legislative chamber reconsidered four clauses in the electoral act amendment bill on Tuesday.\n\nIn July, the senate passed the legislation and empowered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to determine the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nIt was forced to reconsider the provision and some other clauses in the bill after a backlash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile moving a motion to rescind the earlier decision of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday, Yahaya Abdullahi, senate leader, said there are fundamental issues that needed to be addressed in the legislation.\n\n\u201cDesirous of the need to address the observations by the committee and make necessary amendments; and relying on order 1(b) and 53(b) of the senate standing order,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nThe senate subsequently passed the amended bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the build-up to the 2019 general election, political parties considered between direct and indirect primary polls in picking their candidates.\n\nFor instance, the APC approved both direct and indirect primary mode for different states across the country.\n\nThis helped to mitigate the issues arising from the exercise as the stakeholders in those states chose methods that best fit their political terrains.\n\nDIRECT PRIMARY AND CONCERNS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe direct primary mode of picking candidates is where every member of a party participates by voting. This is in contrast to the indirect primary system where voters pick delegates who will then choose the candidate(s).\n\nWhile the senate debated clause 87, Enyinnaya Abaribe, senate minority leader, expressed concerns over the provision of compulsory direct primaries for all political parties in the country.\n\nAbaribe said parties should be allowed to adopt what suits them, adding that not all of them have the \u201ccapacity\u201d to undertake a direct primary poll.\n\n\u201cThe original situation was that the party was left with choices to determine what suits them,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot all parties have the capacity to do direct primaries. I think we may have to leave it open.\u201d\n\nMost of the lawmakers who contributed to the debate spoke in support of the clause. The provision was passed after it was put to a voice vote.\n\nCommenting on the clause, Bukola Saraki, former president of the senate, said the provision may \u201cclog our electoral process\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe two options on the table are to make direct primaries compulsory for all the parties or to leave it open for parties to decide. We should take the latter option. Let us leave each party to decide how it wants to source its candidates,\u201d Saraki said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe experience we have in the past shows that direct primary will lead to a crisis if forced on the parties.\n\n\u201cWe saw how people sent from the national headquarters to conduct primary elections stayed in hotel rooms and conjured up figures which were announced as the result of direct primary elections.\u201d\n\nMERIT AND DEMERIT\n\nThe direct primary system seems to be preferred because every member of a political party has a say in picking the candidate that will fly their flag at any election. Some see this method as more \u201cdemocratic\u201d as against the indirect primary method.\n\nAlso, direct primary method is seen as transparent because it gives some form of credibility to the process and does not supposedly allow the governor of any state or a \u201cstrong politician\u201d hijack the process.\n\nLike Abaribe said, only some political parties could afford the resources to conduct a direct primary exercise.\n\nResources aside, direct primary is time consuming because every vote has to be counted before a candidate is chosen. In cases where the party has a large membership, the process could be cumbersome and flawed.\n\nThis could cause protracted litigation at the courts.\n\nAnother challenge is that political parties do not have comprehensive membership registers and this opens up the direct primary system to the manipulations of \u201cstrong men\u201d.\n\nDIRECT PRIMARY SYSTEM A GAME CHANGER?\n\nThe issues raised earlier about direct primaries may compound the existing problems \u2014 defeating the aim of promoting internal party democracy.\n\nEssentially, how well the system performs will be determined the players. A flawless system can be made flawed by flawed actors.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will also need more funds to oversee direct primaries because it has to authenticate the process.\n\nSo, evidently it is cumbersome and not cost effective.",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "China\u2019s growing influence is transforming African tech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And with significant experience gathered at i/o Ventures, an early-stage seed fund, Alliy was well equipped to run Savannah Fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm looks out for a solid technical co-founder, strong technical team, among others, before investing in a startup.\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Alliy says Savannah Fund invests more than money in startups.\n\nTo find out more, read Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozorim Nwokoma\u2019s chat with Alliy here: Pan-African venture capital firm, Savannah Fund wants to help African startups go global\n\nSpeaking of funding startups, Eden Life, a home services company, has closed a $1.4 million seed.\n\nLocalGlobe led the round, with participation from others, including Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, and Rising Tide Africa.\n\nThe startup offers users domestic services such as cleaning, laundry, and cooking which can be directly requested from its app. Its target market is executives, remote workers, creatives, and techies.\n\nIt plans to use the funding to develop in-house technologies, build its own kitchen and operation hubs, and reduce its reliance on third-party service providers.\n\nElectronic voting and transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Voters Machines prepped for elections in KAD-SIECOM\n\nSince July 2021, there\u2019s being some back and forth between Nigerian legislators and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nOn Friday, July 16, 2021, when the House of Representatives summoned the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) over the issue, Ubale Maska, Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, said less than 50% of the country had access to 3G Internet coverage \u2014 a major hindrance to electronic transmission of results.\n\nInterestingly, the electoral umpire, on Saturday, September 25, 2021, said that it could transmit election results electronically.\n\nAccording to The Premium Times, the Senate on Tuesday, October 12, 2021, amended a clause of the Electoral Amendment Bill to allow INEC to determine the procedure in which elections are conducted and transmitted.\n\nCan electronic voting work? The technology was first used in Kaduna State in May 2018. The truth is, whether it worked or not depends on your perspective.\n\nTechpoint Africa was at the scene of that election, and you can read all about it here. Inside Nigeria\u2019s first ever electronic voting exercise in Kaduna State\n\nElectronic transmission of election results is always a tricky subject. While INEC claims it can be done, Maska\u2019s assertion that 3G Internet coverage isn\u2019t available in some parts of the country throws some doubt.\n\nNigeria\u2019s electricity tariffs to the moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity tariffs in Nigeria have continued to take an upward trajectory in 2021.\n\nAccording to Nairametrics, electricity tariffs were increased three times \u2014 January, June, and September \u2014 this year.\n\nThe tariff increase aligns with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission\u2019s Service Based Tariff (SBT) programme.\n\nPer The Guardian, the programme which started in 2020 has increased electricity tariffs by 50%.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, the average electricity tariff across Nigeria now stands at \u20a632.99 ($0.078) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) since the latest increase on September 1. Consequently, the average electricity tariff for a month is approximately \u20a623,752 ($57.82).\n\nMeanwhile, a World Bank report in 2020 says about 47% of Nigerians do not have access to grid electricity. And estimates the economic cost of irregular power supply in the country at $28 billion, making electricity a major constraint to Nigeria\u2019s private sector.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nSophia, the first android with citizenship, now wants to have a robot baby.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years is a long time, and in the startup scene, it can often seem like forever. In the nine years since its founding, Savannah Fund-backed startups have raised follow-on funding of over $200 million. Techpoint Africa caught up with Mbwana Alliy, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner and chatted on what drives the firm\u2019s investments and future plans.\n\nBefore starting Savannah Fund, Alliy, an electrical and communications engineer and Stanford MBA graduate, worked as a software and aerospace systems engineer for several technology companies in Silicon Valley and the United Kingdom, including Microsoft and the UK\u2019s Defense Evaluation Research Agency.\n\nHe cut his teeth as an investor while working as an associate at i/o Ventures, an early-stage seed fund. He helped source deals, incubate startups, and provide strategic directions for the venture\u2019s portfolio companies.\n\nHis experience at these organisations allowed him to observe developments in Africa\u2019s tech industry. This opportunity showed him the difficulty founders face in getting early-stage capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether with Paul Bragiel, Savannah Fund\u2019s General Partner and a partner at i/o Ventures, he started the firm in 2012. Initially an accelerator, the firm hosted startup cohorts for three months, culminating in a $30,000 investment. In 2016, it fully transitioned to a VC firm supporting early-stage startups.\n\nWhat the firm looks for in startups\n\nSavannah Fund invests between $100,000 and $250,000 in startups, and Alliy shares what they like to see in the founders they back. The first requirement is having at least one technical solid co-founder on the team. With both partners having technical backgrounds, this does not come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, the best startups have strong engineering teams. Aerobotics and Smile Identity (portfolio companies) have strong engineering teams. We are seeing more and more startups that could work without a technical CTO, but that is something that we like.\u201d\n\nThe market size the startup is pursuing is another factor the firm considers. \u201cWe like to go after frontier markets where there\u2019s not much going on. That\u2019s why I like Ethiopia right now. It\u2019s quite disconnected from the rest of Africa, and with a hundred million people, it\u2019s a big market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a big market, the firm also favours startups with the potential to scale across Africa and go global. Two of the companies in its portfolio \u2013 Aerobotics and FlexClub \u2013 have expanded outside Africa; the former operates in the United States while the latter has launched in Mexico.\n\nIn March, the firm brought the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Women\u2019s Finance Initiative (WeFi) on board as investors in their second fund. This has affected the firm\u2019s investment policy, emphasising female founders/teams and issues around environmental, social, and governance (ESG).\n\nAlliy discloses that about 46% of the startups in their portfolio have at least one female founder or a female CEO. In addition, he encourages startups in their portfolio, especially those in the logistics sector, to adopt sustainable practices. Governance is another area the firm takes seriously, but he cautions that timing is crucial in instituting corporate governance.\n\nMore than money\n\nA major effect of the success enjoyed by African startups is that more investors are itching to get a piece of the pie. However, this also means that founders need strategic partners who bring more than money to the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavannah Fund is well-placed to offer founders a lot more than money. Alliy and Bragiel have extensive contacts in the US, having worked there previously. Also, Bragiel is a partner at Golden Gate Ventures, a Singaporean VC firm that has invested in startups like Stripe and AngelList.\n\nPortfolio companies and failures\n\nSome of the startups in Savannah Fund\u2019s portfolio include lending startup, Lidya, identity management startup, Smile Identity, eCommerce startup, Supermart.ng, logistics startup, Sendy, Ugandan gaming company, Kola Studios, and edtech startup, Eneza Education. So far, none of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies has failed.\n\nHowever, Alliy reveals that most of the startups from the firm\u2019s accelerator days failed.\n\nPitfalls for startups to avoid\n\nAlliy believes that focus is vital for startups, especially at the early stages when they may not have as much freedom to experiment. \u201cI see too many startups trying to do too much, too quickly, too early. A focus on the next step is very important.\u201d\n\nHe also advises that founders build to solve problems they care about and not for investors.\n\nWhile speaking with Alliy, his pride in those who work or have worked with him is evident. One such person is Malaika Judd, Co-Founder and CFO at Sendy, a logistics platform. Before joining Sendy, she was a mentor at Savannah Fund, leading the firm\u2019s investment in Nigerian logistics company, African Courier Express (ACE).\n\nDespite being Tanzanian, Savannah Fund has not funded any Tanzanian startup; Alliy hopes to change this soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not made any investments in Tanzania because the previous governments have not been friendly towards startups. Hopefully, that changes soon. Investing in a Tanzanian startup would be my proudest moment,\u201d he remarks with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The report is in line with Techpoint Africa\u2018s mission of democratising the African technology narrative\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint \u2014 the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa \u2014 has since released 12 editions of NSFR and the West African Startup Decade Report (WASDR) within the last three and a half years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this moment, only the first three editions of NSFR were available for free but after rethinking the ultimate vision of Techpoint \u2014 becoming the information warehouse for everything startups, technology, and innovation on the continent, we have decided to make all our reports available for free, starting with the WASDR and NSFR Q1 2021.\n\nFor believing in the Intelligence by Techpoint dream\n\nI\u2019d like to use this opportunity to once again appreciate brands and individuals that have believed in the Intelligence by Techpoint dream.\n\nFuture Hub and SUNRYSE believed in the dream enough to work with us in translating WASDR to Mandarin and Japanese editions respectively. They also played a major role in the campaign and marketing of the report alongside the likes of Statista, Crunchbase, and Maxime Bayen.\n\nThe WASDR is our most expensive report to date but people still believed in our work enough to make a purchase. These people are getting part of the credit for making the decade report available for free. Some of them who accepted to be mentioned are Odunayo Eweniyi (co-founder, PiggyVest and FirstCheck Africa), and Salient Advisory.\n\nOn the part of NSFR, we have subscribers of the paid editions in three digits: it would have been nice to mention you all but that would be a very long list.\n\nBeyond making all our past reports available for free, most (if not all) of our subsequent reports will also be available for free as well. And we will be working with brands, as sponsors, to make them available for free. A couple of these are already in the works and would be released before the year runs out.\n\nTo every brand and person mentioned above (and those not mentioned), we say thank you for believing in the Techpoint Africa dream once again. Do note that this decision doesn\u2019t imply that we are abandoning the Intelligence by Techpoint dream. The only change is that we will be releasing only a single annual edition of the Nigerian Startup Funding Report.\n\nMeanwhile, we will keep our subscribers up-to-date on funding activities in the country, and Africa by extension, as well as other relevant activities, through our monthly newsletter that was started earlier in the year.

          "text": "Foreign portfolio investors have continued to reduce exposure in Nigerian equities with transactions reaching the lowest levels in three years in August, according to data from the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nAfter rising from a low base of N369.56 billion in August 2016 to N906.86 billion in 2018, Nigeria\u2019s foreign portfolio investment (PFI) dropped to a three-year low of N262.85 billion in the comparable month in 2021.\n\nOn a year-on-year comparison, the hot money inflow into Nigeria declined by 44.1 percent from N470.20 billion in August 2020 to N262.85 billion in the same month of 2021. It dropped by 71.02 percent when compared to the N906.86 billion reported in the comparable period in 2018.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy is grappling with a backlog of unmet dollar demand, caused by the decline in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a development that continues to deter fresh inflows after investors struggle to repatriate their already trapped funds.\n\n\u201cForeign investors\u2019 priority is the access to their funds once it matures and this, Nigeria has been unable to achieve. This issue of inability to meet investors\u2019 expectations is happening the second time in 5 years and has consequently dampened investors\u2019 confidence in the economy,\u201d a Lagos-based investment analyst told BusinessDay.\n\nThe shortage of dollar supply which has restricted investors\u2019 ability to recoup their investment in Africa\u2019s largest economy is not the only challenge faced by foreign portfolio investment, data by Financial Derivatives (FDC) has shown.\n\nDue to Nigeria\u2019s exchange rate volatility, FDC said foreign portfolio investors have seen their investment in Nigeria\u2019s largest listed companies eroded in the last three years.\n\nRead also: SEC, EFCC collaborate on Capital Market Development\n\n\u201cFPI investment in bellwethers returned an average of -22 percent in 3 years,\u201d Bismarck Rewane, CEO of FDC said, adding that \u201cnet foreign outflow\u201d is \u201cexpected to linger as currency woes persist.\u201d\n\nToye Oyelakin, investment analyst at Cordros Capital also cited the uncertainty around Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange crisis as a key reason for the decline in foreign inflows.\n\n\u201cInvestors will like to know whether or not there\u2019s a potential for the devaluation of the currency or things like that,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting Nigeria\u2019s 2016 recession that was fuelled by the weak oil price, Oyelakin said \u201cFPI around that period was lower but when there was an introduction of I&E window in 2017, it buoyed sentiments for foreign investors again and we noticed that FPI started increasing. So that must be the 2018 increase you saw. Then in 2020 again, we saw another shock for the oil market, so foreign investors left the market.\u201d\n\nThe naira at the unofficial market, the channel many Nigerians access the dollar from, has depreciated by 18 percent in 2021 from N465/$ on December 31, 2020, to N568/$ on September 30, 2021.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) FX reserves rose by 1.35 percent to $36.60 billion as of September 29, 2021\u2013 the highest level since February 12, 2020 \u2013 signifying the sixth consecutive weekly accretion.\n\nThe current level of the reserves, according to analysts at Coronation Merchant Bank, partially reflects the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to Nigeria coupled with the successfully raised S$4.00 billion in Eurobonds last month.\n\nIt should be able to \u201cprovide the apex bank with enough ammunition to defend the naira in the short term. Nevertheless, FX turnover on the official markers remains relatively low. Thus, there may be continued pressure on the official and parallel exchange rates if the CBN does not increase supply,\u201d the research analysts said.\n\n\u201cWithout any major attempt to increase or diversify Nigeria\u2019s FX proceeds through the export of non-oil products, we believe the FX crisis will continue to linger, specifically when crude oil prices drop significantly,\u201d Ayo Ebo, senior economist and head, research & strategy, Greenwich Merchant Bank said.",

          "text": "The planned listing by IHS on the New York Stock Exchange this week would not only push its valuation to $8 billion, it could also bolster Nigeria\u2019s ambitious plan to rollout the 5G network in 2022, experts believe.\n\n\u201cThis is a good event for IHS and its ability to raise the capital required to build and further develop digital infrastructure that they currently have deployed in Africa and other continents. It is happening at a time when interest in building Africa\u2019s digital economy is growing,\u201d said Teniola Olusola, Nigerian national coordinator, Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI).\n\nAccording to Olusola, who is also a former president of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), the timing of the listing is also in line with the deployment of 5G across Africa and in particular Nigeria where the broadband plan estimates another 40,000 plus towers are required to fill the infrastructure deficit.\n\n\u201cThe industry seeks billions of dollars over the next five years to ensure we remove the digital divide that exists,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is a second attempt at an initial public offer (IPO) by the largest operator of mobile phone masts in Nigeria. IHS had postponed its IPO in 2018 because of fears it was too close to Nigeria\u2019s general elections, reports say. The IPO was to raise $1 billion which could have seen IHS valued at $10 billion.\n\n\u201cA registration statement on Form F-1 relating to these securities has been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but has not yet become effective.\n\nThese securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy these securities be accepted prior to the time the registrations statement becomes effective,\u201d IHS noted in a statement.\n\nThe Nigerian-born but now London-based tower operator and major is targeting to raise up to $540 million from the IPO by offering 22.5 million shares at a price of between $21 and $24 a share, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The company plans to offer 18 million of the shares and the other 4.5 million will be offered by existing shareholders.\n\nRead also: Nigeria is 97% ready for 5G network NCC\n\nDespite having a presence in nine markets across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, experts say Nigeria could be the biggest winner, especially with its plans to deploy 5G network gathering national speed.\n\nAjibola Olude, secretary-general of ATCON said IHS listing could be a strategy to raise enough funding to position for 5G network deployment.\n\n\u201cThis is because 5G requires a lot of money to deploy,\u201d he said, adding that the listing will open up the telecommunications industry in Nigeria to international investment.\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) recently said it is completing a plan to issue 5 slots of the 5G spectrum to willing operators.\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest economy plans to launch a commercial 5G network in January 2022. This has already got Airtel Nigeria and MTN Nigeria asking about the licence.\n\nHowever, there are many hurdles facing the launch of the network. Investors would need to face a licence fee projected at between N75 and N100 billion for a period of 10 years, low adoption in previous cellular generations like 3G and 4G, uncertainty in the policy environment, rising insecurity that has seen thousands of telecom equipment destroyed, and most importantly, a huge deficit in telecommunication infrastructure.\n\nThis may be where IHS can now play a critical role. Raising $540 million from the IPO would not only see the company become the largest Africa-focused company, it also has enormous capital resources to scale its infrastructure across Africa with some focus on the most popular country on the continent.\n\nGoing by its overview of the industry as contained in its SEC filing, the experts say it is obvious IHS is thinking along the same lines.\n\nThe company noted in the filing that growth in population, a large youth demographic, and increasing levels of urbanisation make up characteristics that are expected to support demand for telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the company, Nigeria\u2019s favourable demographics are expected to support growth in the telecommunications industry. The population is one of the youngest in the world, with a median age of 18 years as of 2020, according to Euromonitor.\n\nApproximately 33 percent of the population is between the ages of 15 and 34 as of 2020, and this proportion of the population is expected to grow to 35 percent by 2030, also according to Euromonitor.\n\nNigeria\u2019s rate of urbanisation also makes it an attractive market. Euromonitor estimates that the urban population in Nigeria increased from 39 percent in 2005 to 52 percent in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe believe that in Nigeria, we have delivered the majority of estimated demand for new site deployments by independent tower companies in the market over the last two years, and we are the only independent tower operator in five of our other markets.\n\nFor the period covering 2018, 2019, and 2020 and the first six months of 2021, we have added 11,228 tenants, 15,716 lease amendments, and constructed 2,428 new sites,\u201d the company said in its IPO filing.\n\nIHS has been particularly busy in the Nigerian market where it has a presence across all the states with coverage estimated at 80 percent of the population. As of June 2021, IHS accounted for 16,522 towers of the 37,625 towers in Nigeria, representing almost 50 percent of the total in the market.\n\nThe company expects 5G technology to become available in its African markets over the longer term. To meet the anticipated telecommunications growth, the African markets will likely require over 22,000 new towers and over 30,000 new MNO points of presence over the period December 2020 to December 2025.",

Andrew Emwanta JP reiterated that the government pays pensions to pensioners on or before the 26th of every month and does not owe any pension to date.\n\nHe noted that the agitation by some pensioners early in the week in Benin City was majorly a consequence of disagreement among members of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners (NUP) over statutory deduction of one percent from their pensions in favour of the Union, as check-off dues.\n\nEmwanta said: \u201cMuch as the issue of gratuity was mentioned, it was rather unfortunate that the Edo State Government was caught in the crossfire over the disagreement between members of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners and their leadership. While some members of the Union are in support of the statutory deduction, others are against it.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe State Government is not in default, as far as the issue of monthly pension is concerned. Regarding payment of gratuities, the existing backlog, which predates this present administration, will continue to receive attention from Government, in spite of the dwindling allocations from the Federation Account.\n\n\u201cUnlike in other States where salaries and pensions are being owed or paid in part, the present Government of Edo State has placed a premium on the welfare of the elderly and all workers on the payroll of the State Government.\u201d\n\nHe therefore urged those aggrieved to exercise restraint, in order not to allow political merchants of doom to take advantage of the situation.\n\nThe Commissioner further added that \u201cit is without doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the revenue of Governments, the world over and Edo State is not an exception.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral issues revolve around the payment of pensions and gratuities. As a responsible and responsive Government led by a time-trusted and seasoned technocrat, there was a need to prioritize between regular payment of pensions and dealing with the backlog of gratuities, which were inherited from previous administration in the State.\n\n\u201cIn the 2022 appropriation, there are plans to address the underlying issues around payment of gratuities. In furtherance of the provisions of the life assurance component of the contributory pension scheme, the present administration in Edo State has consistently paid premiums on behalf of its insured employees, resulting in timely payment of death benefits to beneficiaries of deceased civil or public servants.\u201d\n\n...",

Despite getting N249.4 billion, the sixth-highest allocation within the period, the northwestern state of Kano had the highest out-of-school children.\n\nOther top earners that could not keep their children out of the streets include Ondo, which earned N199.3 billion; Borno, N185.2 billion; Katsina, N184.2 billion; Oyo, N176.2 billion; Jigawa, N174.6 billion; Niger, N172.7 billion; Kaduna, N171.8 billion.\n\nAccording to the 2018 data published by the Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC, Kano had 989,234 out-of-school children, Akwa-Ibom 581,800, Katsina 536,122, Kaduna 524,670, Oyo 418,900, Jigawa 337,861, Borno 330,389, Ondo 317,700 and Niger 292,700.\n\nOn the flip side, Delta (N541.8 billion) and Bayelsa (N438.7 billion) \u2013 among the top four earners \u2013 and Edo (N180.4 billion), the tenth highest earner, also had some of the lowest out-of-school children estimates from the same year.\n\nDelta had 145,996 of the nation\u2019s out-of-school children, Edo \u2013 140,798 and Bayelsa \u2013 53,079.\n\nTotal earnings against out-of-school estimates\n\nAll states and the FCT made a combined revenue (FAAC and IGR) of about N11.1 trillion in four years. The figure excludes the IGR for Ebonyi and the FCT in 2015, as well as the latter\u2019s IGR and FAAC in 2016 and its 1GR in 2017.\n\nLagos alone accounted for N1.6 trillion of the over N11 trillion all the states earned.\n\nRivers raked in N865.5 billion; Delta N737 billion; Akwa Ibom N684.2 billion; Bayelsa N481.5 billion; Ogun N391.7 billion; Kano N380.5 billion.\n\nOther higher earners include Edo N276.4 billion; Oyo N257.8 billion; Kaduna N256.4 billion; Ondo N253.8 billion; FCT N233.4 billion; Enugu N229.8 billion; Anambra N225.7 billion; Abia N214.5 billion.\n\nAkwa Ibom, Kano, Oyo, Ondo and Kaduna are again higher earners with high unschooled children.\n\nOn the other hand, Delta, Bayelsa, Edo, the FCT, Enugu, Anambra and Abia kept their out-of-school children figure low.\n\nMeanwhile, all units of the federation, save Lagos and Ogun, are largely dependent on FAAC allocation because it dwarfs their internally generated revenue significantly.\n\nOnly Lagos and Ogun States earned more from IGR than they did FAAC in those four years combined.\n\nOut-of-school children\n\nMore than half of Nigeria\u2019s 10.2 million out-of-school children live in 10 states of the country, data published in the 2018 digest of basic education statistics by the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) and corroborated by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its 2020 report on women and men showed.\n\nAll 10 have a combined 5.2 million children not attending primary school.\n\nThe 10.2 million estimate, more than 60 per cent of them boys, is more than a quarter of the nation\u2019s 40.8 million children of primary school age (between six and 11 years).\n\nBy implication, as of 2018, for every four Nigerian children, one had no access to primary school education.\n\nLeast FAAC earners with lower numbers of out-of-school children\n\nAgain, nine of the bottom fifteen FAAC earners from 2015 to 2018 are among the bottom fifteen states with the least out-of-school children.\n\nA total of N90.6 billion was earned as FAAC allocation by Osun State in four years, making it the least earner, yet it had 165,114 out-of-school children, the fourteenth least by all states.\n\nEkiti earned N120.2 billion, making it the second least earner, yet it had the lowest out-of-school children, 50,945.\n\nDespite earning N122.2 billion, Cross River had 97,919 out-of-school students. Gombe made N132.9 billion and kept its unschooled children estimate at 162,000.\n\nKwara made N133 billion and had 84,247 out-of-school. With N135.5 billion, Ebonyi had 145,373 unschooled children. Nasarawa\u2019s estimate was 187,000 children even though it got an allocation of N138.9 billion. Enugu got N153.3 billion and had 82,050 out-of-school children. Abia got N158.7 billion and kept its figure at 91,548 children.\n\nOverall least earners with lower numbers of out-of-school children\n\nAgain, overall Osun (N129.6 billion), Ekiti (N138 billion), Ebonyi (N149.1 billion), Gombe (N153.2 billion), Nasarawa (N160.3 billion) and Cross River (N186.3 billion) were the least earners among the lowest fifteen states with out-of-school children.\n\nSpecifically, Ekiti made the second least overall money in the four years reviewed, yet it had the lowest out-of-school children.",
          "summary": "Despite getting N249.4 billion, the sixth-highest allocation within the period, the northwestern state of Kano had the highest out-of-school children.\nRivers raked in N865.5 billion; Delta N737 billion; Akwa Ibom N684.2 billion; Bayelsa N481.5 billion; Ogun N391.7 billion; Kano N380.5 billion.\nOther higher earners include Edo N276.4 billion; Oyo N257.8 billion; Kaduna N256.4 billion; Ondo N253.8 billion; FCT N233.4 billion; Enugu N229.8 billion; Anambra N225.7 billion; Abia N214.5 billion.\nOn the other hand, Delta, Bayelsa, Edo, the FCT, Enugu, Anambra and Abia kept their out-of-school children figure low.\nSpecifically, Ekiti made the second least overall money in the four years reviewed, yet it had the lowest out-of-school children.",

The reason being is that if these allegations leveled against Dr Audi are mere response to sentimental suspicions, then it\u2019s very denting on a painstaking career built overtime.\n\n\u201cNow these allegations are too weighty like we said and must be logically dissected in order to set the records straight. We stand for what we are convinced to be right.\n\n\u201cWe will take every allegations one after the other as a buttress to our stand for what is right. Dr Audi is barely month in office so logically, and needs probably, at least, one to two years as CG to be able to perpetrate these allegations, especially the ones bordering on finance.\u201d\n\nThe statement further pointed out that, \u201cAlso the paramilitary does not do secret recruitment. So, therefore, for the recruitment to be a success, the recruits need to have an IPPIS number, and for that to be done, that means it\u2019s a public affair and not a private one.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the area bordering on nepotism should not be confused and misinterpreted out of context. People work with people they understand.\n\n\u201cGovernment contracts are procedural. They follow a bureaucracy. So Dr Abubakar Audi cannot just award contract to just anyone. All these allegations are response of envy.\u201d\n\nThe group said that all allegations were \u201cproducts of office grapevine as \u2018hearsay\u2019 allegations do not hold water.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone is aggrieved, he or she should channel his/her displeasure to the appropriate quarters not by destroying a reputation that has taken painstaking effort to build overtime.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statement added, \u201cWe the Civil Society Organisation will continue to be the societal watchdog as we will continue to criticize, blow whistle, condemn and raise alarm when necessary if we find any public office holder wanting.\n\n\u201cHowever, we will equally appreciate, applaud and make recommendation when necessary.\u201d",

Freaney, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the United States Secret Service announced the unsealing of the indictment.\n\nAs alleged in the indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court, some of the 11 Nigerians were identified as Adedayo John, Oluwadamilola Akinpelu, Kazeem Raheem, Morakinyo Gbeyide and Warris Adenuga a.k.a Blue.\n\nThere were also Smart Agunbiade, Lateef Goloba, Samsondeen Goloba, Olawale Olaniyan, Olawoyin Peter Olanrewaju and Emmanuel Oronsaye-Ajayi.\n\nThey were all collectively accused of participating in one or both of a money laundering conspiracy and bank fraud conspiracy, which received funds stolen from victims.\n\nThe charge was in connection with their involvement in laundering millions of dollars in proceeds derived from business email compromises and romance fraud schemes.\n\nNine defendants were arrested Wednesday in the District of New Jersey and the Eastern District of New York, and were presented before United States Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in the Southern District of New York.\n\nOne defendant was arrested in the Southern District of Texas, and was presented in that district\u2019s federal court.\n\nOne defendant remains at large.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cAs alleged, the defendants were part of a criminal enterprise that not only defrauded businesses by assuming the online identities of legitimate counterparties, but also preyed on vulnerable elderly people, deceiving victims into sending money in phony romance scams. Thanks to the Secret Service, the defendants are now facing federal felony charges.\u201d\n\nModus Operandi\n\nVictims were typically defrauded in one of two ways.\n\nIn some instances, business email compromise fraud schemes were used to trick businesses into transferring funds to bank accounts the victims believed were under the control of legitimate recipients of the funds as part of normal business operations.\n\nUnknown to the victims, the bank accounts were under the control of the Defendants or their co-conspirators.\n\nIn other instances, romance scams were used, primarily through electronic messages sent via email, text messaging, social media, or online dating websites, to deceive victims.\n\nMany of the victims \u2013 many of whom were vulnerable older men and women \u2013 into believing they were in romantic relationships with fake identities, and then using false pretenses to cause the victims to transfer funds to bank accounts controlled by the Defendants or their co-conspirators.\n\nAs a result of these frauds, law enforcement officers have identified more than 50 victims who have transferred more than $9 million to bank accounts under the control of the Defendants.\n\nTen defendants \u2013 ADEDAYO JOHN, 32, OLUWADAMILOLA AKINPELU, 26, KAZEEM RAHEEM, 29, MORAKINYO GBEYIDE, 39, WARRIS ADENUGA, a/k/a \u201cBlue,\u201d 26, LATEEF GOLOBA, 27, SAMSONDEEN GOLOBA, 29, OLAWALE OLANIYAN, 41, OLAWOYIN PETER OLAREWAJU, 34, and EMMANUEL ORONSAYE-AJAYI, 30 \u2013 are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nNine defendants \u2013 ADEDAYO JOHN, 32, SMART AGUNBIADE, 28, OLUWADAMILOLA AKINPELU, 26, MORAKINYO GBEYIDE, 39, WARRIS ADENUGA, a/k/a \u201cBlue,\u201d 26, LATEEF GOLOBA, 27, SAMSONDEEN GOLOBA, 29, OLAWOYIN PETER OLAREWAJU, 34, and EMMANUEL ORONSAYE-AJAYI, 30 \u2013 are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.\n\nOne defendant \u2013 MORAKINYO GBEYIDE, 39 \u2013 is also charged with one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years in prison.\n\nRead the full indictment here:u.s._v._john_et_al_indictment_21_cr_609_redacted_0",

At the same time, roughly 96 per cent of the population in low-income countries have yet to receive a single COVID jab,\u201d the IMF noted.\n\nThe recovery gap between richer and poorer countries is expected to widen, with the IMF calling for advanced economies to regain their pre-pandemic trend path next year and exceed it by 0.9 per cent in 2024.\n\nBy contrast, the fund predicted economic growth in emerging and developing economies \u2013 minus China \u2013 would remain 5.5 per cent below pre-pandemic forecasts in 2024, \u201cresulting in a larger setback to improvements in their living standards.\u201d\n\nWhile the IMF saw inflation reverting to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of next year, a more granular analysis reveals a wide disparity in the outlook between nations.\n\nFor advanced economies, the fund believed headline inflation would peak in the final months of this year and decline to about two per cent by mid-2022.\n\nFor emerging market and developing economies, headline inflation is expected to peak at 6.8 per cent later this year before falling to about four per cent by the middle of next year \u201cwith risks tilted to the upside over the medium term.\u201d",

These MDAs failed to appear. These MDAs failed to appear.\n\n\u201cThe Senate considers this attitude as a sabotage to the effort of the federal government to secure the loans and fund the infrastructure development that this country desperately needs.\n\nAlready, the National Assembly has approved the loan requests but there is need for clarifications by the affected agencies.\n\n\u201cI will therefore call the names of these MDAs, and we are giving them just one week to appear before the Committee on Loan and Foreign Debts. And if they failed to appear, we\u2019ll take appropriate and prompt action because this Senate will not condone any sabotage to the effort of this administration to provide infrastructure.\u201d\n\nSenators urge judicious use\n\nEarlier at the plenary during debate on the budget proposals, many of the senators who spoke, emphasised the need for the N5.01trillion borrowing to be utilised judiciously on infrastructure as stated in the proposal.\n\nIn their separate submissions, the lawmakers also stressed the need for government to look inward for implementation of the budget through increased revenue generation, collection and remittances by relevant agencies.\n\nAfter passing the budget for second reading, the Senate accordingly set aside the 18th of this month to 9th of November for consideration at committee level.",

Aviation is also capable of stimulating recovery and growth of the global economy by acting as an enabler and multiplier of economic activity\u201d.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the global aviation industry operates as an interconnected ecosystem, it is therefore imperative that all the States of the world implement the ICAO Council Aviation Recovery Taskforce (CART) recommendations and guidance, which are based on the latest development of the COVID-19.\n\n\u201cICAO, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, is required to bring to maturity in short term a consensual modality for establishment and deployment of a global health passport as well as the specification of infrastructure (soft/hard) and training of professionals,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) says a new taskforce may be the last chance to find the origins of Covid-19.\n\nIt has nominated 26 experts to join the body, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (Sago).\n\nMore than a year-and-a-half since the virus was detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the question of how it first emerged remains unclear.\n\nThe team will consider if the virus jumped from animals to humans in Wuhan markets or leaked in a lab accident.\n\nChina has strongly refuted the second theory.\n\nIn February, a WHO team tasked with investigating Covid\u2019s origins flew to China and concluded that the virus had probably come from bats but that more work was needed.\n\nThe team called the lab leak theory \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d.\n\nBut the WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, later said the investigation had been hampered by a lack of data and transparency from China.\n\nThe proposed members of the Sago group include six experts who visited China as part of the previous team.\n\nAside from coronavirus, Sago will also look into the origins of other high-risk pathogens.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks,\u201d said Dr Tedros said.\n\nIn a joint editorial in the journal Science, Dr Tedros and other WHO officials said \u201ca lab accident cannot be ruled out\u201d.\n\nMichael Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies director, said Sago\u2019s work may be the \u201clast chance to understand the origins of this virus\u201d.\n\nThe announcement of the new group comes as CNN reported that China was preparing to test tens of thousands of blood bank samples taken in the early months of the pandemic.\n\nBut Chen Xu, China\u2019s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said Sago\u2019s work should not be \u201cpoliticised\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is time to send teams to other places,\u201d he said.\n\nAlmost two years since the start of the pandemic, we still don\u2019t know how or when the deadly Sars-Cov-2 virus emerged. Investigating new viruses is always extremely complex, but scientists have been able to find the source of the two previous coronavirus outbreaks \u2013 both of which have emerged from animals.\n\nIt\u2019s been nine months since the last WHO-convened mission returned from Wuhan, saying a similar animal spillover was the most likely source of the pandemic. But questions continue to be raised about a potential accident at a Wuhan lab which studies coronaviruses and keeps thousands of bat samples. China has strenuously denied this.\n\nThe WHO says China still hasn\u2019t shared crucial data from the earliest days of the pandemic. The UN agency \u2013 which has been caught in the firing line between China and the US\u2019s bigger geopolitical fight on this issue \u2013 has been hardening its language on investigations into a lab leak theory.\n\nThe science is becoming increasingly politicised, with China so far refusing to allow international scientists back into the country.\n\nIt\u2019s hoped this new Sago body with experts from 26 different countries will be able to break this impasse, and finally get some much needed answers so the world can better prepare for future outbreaks.",

          "text": "Kenyan world record holder Agnes Tirop has been found stabbed to death at her home in the western town of Iten, with police treating her husband as a suspect.\n\nThe two-time World Athletics Championships bronze medallist, who finished fourth in the Olympic 5,000m final two months ago, was 25.\n\nLast month, Tirop set the world record for a women\u2019s only 10km road race in Germany.\n\nA criminal investigation is now underway into her death, with police saying her husband has gone missing.\n\nOn Wednesday, crime scene investigators were at the house of Tirop, who police say was reported missing by her father on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWhen police got in the house, they found Tirop on the bed and there was a pool of blood on the floor,\u201d Tom Makori, head of police for the area, said.\n\n\u201cThey saw she had been stabbed in the neck, which led us to believe it was a knife wound, and we believe that is what caused her death.\n\n\u201cHer husband is still at large, and preliminary investigations tell us her husband is a suspect because he cannot be found. Police are trying to find her husband so he can explain what happened to Tirop.\u201d\n\nMakori added that police believe that CCTV in the house may be able to help with their investigation.\n\nTirop was also found dead with a stab wound to her stomach, sources have told the BBC.\n\n\u201cAthletics Kenya are distraught to learn about the untimely death of World 10,000m bronze medallist Agnes Tirop,\u201d the country\u2019s athletics body said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are still working to unearth more details surrounding her demise. Kenya has lost a jewel who was one of the fastest-rising athletics giants on the international stage, thanks to her eye-catching performances on the track.\u201d\n\nTirop\u2019s first taste of international success saw her win the world junior 5,000m bronze in 2012 and 2014, as well as a world junior cross country silver in 2013.\n\nTwo years later, during a rapid ascent, she won the senior World Cross Country championships in China, becoming the second-youngest woman after Zola Budd to claim gold.\n\nAt the 2020 Olympic Games in August, Tirop finished just outside the medal places for the women\u2019s 5,000m, trailing Ethiopia\u2019s bronze medallist Gudaf Tsegay by 0.75 seconds.\n\n\u201cIt is unsettling, utterly unfortunate and very sad that we\u2019ve lost a young and promising athlete who, at a young age of 25 years, had brought our country so much glory,\u201d Kenya\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta said.\n\n\u201cIt is even more painful that Agnes, a Kenyan hero by all measures, painfully lost her young life through a criminal act perpetuated by selfish and cowardly people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge our law enforcement agencies to track down and apprehend the criminals responsible for the killing of Agnes so that they can face the full force of the law,\u201d the head of state added.\n\nAs well as her 10,000m bronze medals at both the 2017 and 2019 World Athletics Championships, Tirop also impressed off the track.\n\nIn September, she set a time of 30 minutes and one second in Herzogenaurach, Germany, as she took 28 seconds off the old 10km road race record set in 2002.\n\nFormer double Olympic champion and World Athletics president Sebastian Coe led tributes from the sport, describing Tirop as \u201cone of the world\u2019s best female distance runners over the past six years\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAthletics has lost one of its brightest young stars in the most tragic circumstances. This is a terrible blow to the entire athletics community, but especially to her family, her friends and Athletics Kenya and I send them all our most heartfelt condolences.\u201d\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach called her \u201ca young and bright talent,\u201d who \u201cgave hope and inspiration to so many people,\u201d while the athlete\u2019s sponsor Adidas said Tirop\u2019s \u201clegacy will forever live on in our memory\u201d.\n\nMichel Boeting, who has acted as a sports agent for many of Kenya\u2019s leading runners, tweeted: \u201cWe will never again see that majestic running style. We will never again see you raising your arms in celebration.\n\n\u201cBut the worst is we will never see your beautiful smile again. You were Royal. It was a pleasure knowing you.\u201d",
