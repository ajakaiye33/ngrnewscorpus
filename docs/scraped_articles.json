Mike Umoh, stated these during an interactive session with journalists in Abuja on Friday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe next dispensation, which we eagerly look forward to with hope, does not give room for trading blames or for that petty partisanship, which has often been defined along tribal, ethnic, religious or political affiliations.\n\n\u201cThese tools, in the hands of typical politicians, have been used for too long to mesmerise and exploit the people; most politicians use them as a smokescreen to hide their clandestine interests and ambitions.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, is the time true Nigerians must rise in unison to act and lend their voices to all that is good and noble to save our country. It is time to wise up and correct mistakes of the past that have plunged the nation into the excruciating pains we now experience.\n\n\u201cThe only reasonable political consideration now left to choose from, irrespective of our tribe, tongue and religious beliefs, is between truth and falsehood, good and bad, the oppressed and the oppressor, and the loyal and disloyal citizens of our country.\u201d\n\nUmoh also decried the level of political apathy of citizens, noting that millions of citizens do not yet have the permanent voter cards while many who had failed to vote on election days.\n\nHe encouraged Nigerians to get their voter cards.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023: Utomi, Na\u2019Abba, Agbakoba\u2019s mega party issues APC, PDP quit notice",
          "text": "..\n\n.As Adebayo emerges party\u2019s presidential hopeful\n\n\u2026Nigerians\u2019ll reject them, says Adebayo\n\n\u2026Blames inability to tame worsening insecurity on divisive security architecture\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nABUJA: A presidential aspirant under the Mega Political Movement, Mr. Adewole Adebayo has predicted doom for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, ahead of 2023 general elections, saying Nigerians will reject during the polls.\n\nAdebayo is seeking to occupy the nation\u2019s number one position under a political party to be unveiled soon by the National Consultative Front, NCFront.\n\nREAD ALSOPDP\u2019s attack on Buhari over cancellation of Zamfara visit, shameful, disgraceful \u2014 Presidency\n\nThe new mega political movement expected to transmute into a third force, a political party being championed by renowned economist, Professor Pat Utomi, legal luminary, Olisa Agbakoba, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Na\u2019Abba and Northern Elders\u2019 Forum, NEF, chieftain, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed among others.\n\nSpeaking with select newsmen, weekend in Abuja, Adebayo, who is an international legal practitioner said he joined the presidential race to give hope to Nigerians again.\n\nHe said after terrible performance records of PDP and incumbent APC administrations, admitted that Nigerians need a new leadership would offer them that hope of getting other things.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAnd Nigerians we used to have it, it was common to us in the Guinness Book of Records, any message, any survey you do, will tell you that Nigerians are the happiest people in the world and you cannot be happy if you are hopeless.\n\n\u201cSo the government has robbed us of that hope and Nigerians now, for the first time since civilisation, Nigerians now believe that \u201ctomorrow no go better.\u201d But tomorrow go better used to be our motto in this country that the person who had the worst day will be sure that tomorrow would be better.\n\n\u201cThat has been stolen from us. So we need to come out and bring a new narrative to show that we have hope.\u201d\n\nOn his second reasons to join the race, Adebayo said, \u201cThere\u2019s these private treaties that politicians sign with one another, it\u2019s a conspiracy of perpetual underdevelopment whereby you meet and say well, let me help you to come to power.\n\n\u201cYou do it anyhow you want to do it, people are happy or not, then you rotate it to me, you also help me to come there. So the equation does not include the people.\n\n\u201cI thought that what we should do is to listen to what people are saying and you see many people who are coming out to run, they always say they helped Buhari to come to power or they helped somebody to come to power in the past and they are promised that it is their turn but no one is mentioning the people.\n\n\u201cSo I thought that we should come out and let people know that whatever bounced cheque you are given out on the corridors of power, it is not binding on the people. People want to elect a government that comes from them.\n\nOn the worsening security situation in the country, the Ondo State born politician, blamed the failures to return the country to path of normalcy on disunity within the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\n\u201cThen the fourth element he police, judiciary, army, DSS, whatever institution, insurance, whatever. Once you set institution up, those who are in government, those who are supposed to work in those institutions, streis lack of professionalism across board. Every institution has been compromised .\n\n\u201cEvery institution is there to serve those who are incumbent, whether it\u2019s tngthen them, leave them alone for the next person to take over, privatise and personalise these institutions.\n\n\u201cSo these institutions start to conflict. So you find out that DSS is fighting EFCC, EFCC is fighting police, police is fighting army, the Airforce does not want to give air cover to the soldier because it\u2019s fighting with the chief of army staff, the NSA does not greet the chief of army staff, everything is upside down.\n\n\u201cThese institutions which are supposed to be complementary and work with one another to give continuity to the state have been personalised by those who are there and the character and indiscipline of those who are there is now reflecting on these institutions.\n\n\u201cSo the new people who go there pay money to enter because they see these institutions as a means of exploiting the people. They don\u2019t go there reflecting the philosophy of the institutions and lastly and very importantly, is the question of the role of money in politics.\n\n\u201cEverybody will tell you that you first have to be s thief before you look for public office or you have to go and register your name among those people who are thieves so that they can sponsor you.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t believe the ordinary Nigerian, can come out and vie for any office in the country and offer a platform. So we thought that we should do this. And for me personally, it would be a case of gross malpractice for me and for all that Nigeria has done for me, in became 50 years old last week.\n\nOn why APC and PDP must be voted out next year, Adebayo said, \u201cWe have the All Progressives Congress, APC, which came to power in 2015, on the mantra of change and the issues that we are confronted with that time -security, corruption unemployment and generally bad infrastructure and low currency management. Now that government had a second term, have had seven years plus to put their change into action.\n\n\u201cWhat we got from them is change for the worse. The insecurity is now worse and taking a new dimension \u2013 banditry, killing and all sorts of threat to human life. The infrastructure we\u2019ve not see much of it, but we still have a lot of debt.\n\n\u201cThe foreign exchange has gotten worse. It couldn\u2019t have been worse than what it was before but they managed to make it worse. Now we have no employment and staple food and basic things have gone up and the country is being given an excuse that well, as bad as the APC government is, its badness came from the previous government of PDP.\n\n\u201cAnd we have in the opposition the PDP which goes without apology that it ran a very bad government but it\u2019s always taunting us saying okay, you see we ran a very bad government but look at the one you replaced us with, they are even worse than us.\n\n\u201cSo let us come back and run another bad government for you because we have a franchise for running a bad government. So when you are having these raised to the bottom, in your analysis, you discover that it\u2019s time for ordinary citizens to come out.",

Local Government Administration as a tier of Government.\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nAHEAD of the presentation of the report of the Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Senators have bowed to President Muhammadu Buhari, thereby rejecting the creation of State Police.\n\nThe Senate Constitution Review Committee while it rejected state Police, it has resolved that President and the thirty- Six State Governors will constitute Federal and State Executive Councils respectively within 6o days after being sworn in.\n\nThe Senate Constitution Review of the 1999 Constitution is chaired by the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, All Progressives Congress, APC, Delta Central and when inaugurated in August 2020, it was saddled with the responsibility of coming up with a reviewed constitution, with the overall interest of Nigerians at heart.\n\nAs part of moves to complete its work to enable Senators to vote on the various issues, the Committee has been engaged in Marathon meetings since last week, with one of such meetings held on Wednesday last week after plenary.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSuspected armed robber burnt to death, 3 escape in Imo\n\nA source told Vanguard that the issue of state Police has been rejected by the Senators as it will not form one of the issues that have been adopted when the report will be presented at plenary\n\nAccording to the source, voices against the creation of State police outnumbered those that are for it against the backdrop that members of the All Progressives Congress, APC are speaking the language of the party and that of President Buhari who had kicked against State Police.\n\nWhen Vanguard sought to know if State Police has been adopted by the Committee, the sources responded severely, saying\u201d No State Police\u201d\n\nThe Committee has also voted for full autonomy to the Local Government Councils and same with the Judiciary.\n\nAccording to the report which Vanguard sighted, the Committee has voted for no more joint account of Local government Councils with the State Governments.\n\nWith this development, Local Government Councils will now receive their allocations directly from the federation account. Local Government Administration as a tier of Government.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cNo state police. President and Governors to constitute Federal and State Executive Councils respectively within 6o days after being sworn in. Full autonomy to the Local Government Councils. Same with the Judiciary. No more joint account of LG Councils with State Government. LG Councils to receive their allocations directly from the federation account. Local Government Administration as a tier of Government.\u201d\n\nRecall that President Buhari early this month had again rejected the institution of state police in the country.\n\nSpeaking during an interview with Channels Television last night, the President said: \u201cState police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local governments and the governors. Are the third tiers of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Let the people in local government tell you the truth; the fight between local governments and the governor.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s position, which came a day after a Chief Superintendent of Police, CSP defied the order of Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo- Olu to vacate the Magodo Phase 2 Estate area of the state, elicited sharp criticisms in the polity with a host of groups and eminent Nigerians insisting on state police.\n\nIn a swipe reaction to the President, former Federal Commissioner for Information and South-South Leader, Chief Edwin Clark asked President Buhari to listen to the popular opinion of Nigeria by establishing State Police that forms one of the cardinal ingredients in a Federal system of government.\n\nAccording to Clark, the excuse by President Buhari for kicking against the creation of state police that state governors will misuse it was not be obtainable because the Federal government is also using the Nigeria Police Force to persecute perceived political opponents, thereby undermining the National Assembly and obstructing free speeches.\n\nRecall that Senator Omo- Agege had at a briefing in May last year assured that the report where Senators will vote on the issues will be ready in July before the lawmakers embark on their annual recess.\n\nHe had disclosed that prior to the close of submission of memoranda, the Committee had received 250 memoranda, but have been suppressed into sixteen issues of discourse, adding then that there was still room for fresh submissions at the six geopolitical zones of the country where the zonal public hearings were held simultaneously in all the centres on Wednesday 26th and Thursday 27th May 2021.\n\nAccording to Omo- Agege, Gender Equality for Women, Federal Structure and Power devolution Local Government / Local Government Autonomy, State Local Government Creation, Electoral Reform, State Police, Judicial Reforms, Time-line for Assent of Bills and Passage of Appropriation Bill, others would form issues of discourse in the process of the Constitution review.\n\nOmo-Agege had said, \u201d by the time the window for receiving these memoranda closed, the Committee had received over 250 memoranda. The memoranda have been analysed and the Committee have held several consultations and meetings to deliberate on the process and submissions in preparation for the Public hearings at the national and zonal levels. Following from the analysis of the memoranda submitted, the issues have increased to sixteen as listed below: Gender Equity/Increased participation of Women and Vulnerable groups in governance, The Federal Structure in governance and Power Devolution, Local Government Administration/Local Government autonomy, Public Revenue, Fiscal Federalism and Revenue Allocation Constitutional Provision for the Establishment of State Police, Judicial Reform \u2013 Adjudication of election and pre-election matters and other justice delivery concerns.\n\n\u201cElectoral Reforms that will make INEC deliver transparent, credible, free and fair elections, Political parties, Independent candidature and election management Socio-economic rights as contained in Chapter II of the Constitution.

They say charity begins at home. This is the case with all the roads in Idea to nation.\u201d\n\nThe chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), also reminded Okorocha that being a President is about service delivery, obedience to rule of law, adherence to due process, constructing quality projects, management or deploying scarexe resources to things that will benefit the people, sincerely leading the people and being altruistic in governance, adding that Okorocha must consider quitting from the presidential race to save himself from political extinction.\n\nNwamkpa further posited that Okorocha\u2019s presidential aspiration is a mockery of an expected sound leadership that Nigerians yearn for in 2023, insisting that he is under illusion that Okorocha emerging President of Nigeria will be a disaster of monumental proportions, and imo state may be cursed by the rest of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs Imolites, we have had your experience the bitter way in your eight years here and we are afraid Nigeria will explode under your hand if the country experiences what we experienced here with you.\n\n\u201cOga, please don\u2019t be offended ooo, do you mean you really want to be Nigerian President? I ask this question because I am afraid that two years into your regime, National Theatre, NNPC, University of Abuja, International Conference Centre, Abuja and other national assets may end up being converted to your personal or family property. You know you have that rare courage to pilfer and brazenly convert public properties without any qualms of conscience. You know we had such an experience with you in Imo state. And you will justify it when you will tell the world that Rochas Foundation acquired 95% of the equity share of NNPC while the entire country has 5%.and will even offer to buy off Nigeria 5% equity share. Oga, you know we had the experience here with you as governor.\u201d\n\nNwankpa also queried Okorocha, \u201cas senator for two years plus now, how many Senatorial zone briefings have you held? How many bills and motions have you sponsored or co-sponsored? What is the size of your performance at the Senate?\n\nHe, however, submitted that Okorocha\u2019s presidential aspiration is one aspiration that offends good conscience and defeats the genuine desires of Nigerians for a tested and trusted leader.\n\n\u201cYour outing as Governor is a morrow to what you will do if given the opportunity.

Whatever be the case, there must be a limit to trivialization\u201d, the statement read.\n\nIt added that all over the world, Commanders-in-Chief, serving or those that have left office, \u201ccannot hop into a car and go anywhere they want, at any time of the day\u201d.\n\nShehu said when roads are closed for presidential movements, consideration is also given to the safety of other road users, not just that of the President or Governor.\n\n\u201cThe statement on the issue by the PDP attacking the President for not making it to Gusau without this being planned ahead of the journey is shameful and disgraceful for a party that held the presidency of the country in the past. What is their own record?\n\n\u201cIt is sad for the country that the bankruptcy of issues has forced the PDP, so-called leading opposition party, to hang on to life by only telling lies. And their caravan of falsehood has moved even more speedily following the inauguration of their not-so-new national executive at the end of last year.\u201d\n\nHe told Zamfara political actors, who claim the cancellation was a victory for their faction of the APC using songs and videos, to know that their joy is a short lived one.\n\nThe presidential aide reiterated that as promised in his address, Buhari will visit Gusau in matter of time.",

          "text": "By Cosmas Omegoh (Lagos), Gyang Bere (Jos), Femi Folaranmi (Yenagoa), and Emmanuel Adeyemi (Lokoja)\n\nIn few months\u2019 time , the electoral process will start running in full swing. Then politicians will launch into electioneering, jostling to win the electorate and their votes. The potpourri of political activities will set the polity buzzing; tension will follow; anxiety will be running over. All sights, all thoughts will focus on the elections and 2023.\n\nBut what about insecurity \u2013 the nemesis many believe is currently ruling every inch of the Nigerian space like a leviathan? Has anyone given a thought to how it might shape the colour of things to come?\n\nWhat are some of the realities of insecurity in the country today?\n\nFindings showed that in the country now, many are ruled by high-level fear. Fear of bandits and banditry, political thugs and thugery, insurgents and insurgency, agitators and agitation, herders and their bloodletting. Then of kidnappers.\n\nAt the moment, there is a sustained orgy of banditry and mindless killing in the Northwest. And the activities of Boko Haram and ISWAP in the Northeast still remain a serious threat. Pockets of the insurgents have drifted to the North-central. There, they have established various terror cells; sacked villages and taken over territories from the government, imposing their own taxes, while mowing down innocent citizens. Then there are marauding herdsmen driving the natives far from their fields and ancestral homelands in Plateau and Benue states in particular. Then in the Southeast, the activities of IPOB/ESN are there; the South-south and Southwest zones too have their own fair share of the problem. The wind of violence is blowing everywhere \u2013 gusty without any let up or so it seems.\n\nDisappointed over insecurity\n\nFormer member of the House of Representatives representing Plateau State, Hon Bitrus Kaze, is aghast that the country is having a rough patch under the Muhammadu Buhari presidency.\n\n\u201cWe have never gone this badly, and this should tell Nigerians that people who raised our hope and trust in 2015 have demonstrated to us the stuff they are made up of. If they themselves couldn\u2019t handle our security, how can they bring people that will handle our security in 2023?\u201d he queried, lamenting that \u201cfor this to be happening under President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired military head of state, is disturbing and worrisome.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, another former House member, Hon Bolous Sylva Indiamowei who represented Yenagoa/ Kolokuma/ Opokuma between 2003 and 2007 said that the state of insecurity and the grinding poverty in the country might push the country to the edge.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria might be at the crossroads in 2023 because of the general elections, but expressed optimism that God would rescue the country.\n\n\u201cElection year is always turbulent in Nigeria. The general state of insecurity is a source of concern, so also the economic situation.\n\n\u201cForget about the figures the various agencies are churning out, there is widespread poverty in the country. And I am sure the president is aware of the real situation.\n\n\u201cThese two issues put together affect the society and could push Nigeria to the crossroads such that we might have to be on our knees to pray to God to rescue the country.\u201d\n\nA security analyst, Ben Okezie, echoed that \u201cright now, the security agencies are overwhelmed,\u201d emphasising that \u201ceven the president is overwhelmed. Short and simple!\n\n\u201cWhy are the security personnel overwhelmed? Simple! They are not being adequately taken care of.\n\n\u201cNow, look at the ISWAP. They have good hands, with retired security personnel all over the world joining them. Now, they are in Niger and Zamfara states collecting taxes and installing emirs. They don\u2019t sleep, but it looks like our own security agencies are sleeping. With their presence in those places how do you conduct elections?\u201d\n\nInsecurity has been there for long\n\nBut not everyone believes the level of insecurity in the land is such a big deal to hold back the hand of things.\n\nAfter all, Nigeria has been expressing similar challenges all along.\n\nFormer All Progressives Congress (APC) chairman, Enugu State chapter, Dr Ben Nwoye believes that \u201cinsecurity has been there much longer before now,\u201d although he admits it is a little bit \u201cwidespread\u201d today. He also believes the situation has come to stay, adding that \u201cit is a global issue.\u201d\n\nHe is optimistic this \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to stop the country from moving forward,\u201d as it can be contained.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Kogi State governor on Water Resources, Alhaji Yahaya Ade Ismail, also believes that the 2023 general election will be peaceful despite the security challenges. He, however, called for \u201cfairness, justice and equity across the party lines.\u201d\n\nHe is of the view that \u201cif all the state governors will work hard to secure their own states, there will be no fear of any security threat.\u201d\n\nLet elections hold\n\nEven while Nigerians battle with insecurity in the land, they stand united that elections have to hold as scheduled.\n\nDr Nwoye and others want the 2023 general elections to go on unhindered. According to him, \u201cthere is no need saying that because of insecurity, we should all vamoose.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, there was insecurity, yet elections held. Recently, governorship election held in Anambra State amid all the noise and hoopla.\n\n\u201cIt is the job of the government to fight insecurity and ensure that our democratic process continues.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that in 2014, Boko Haram insurgents were at their heights in the Northeast, yet elections were conducted. He, therefore, wants the country \u201cto borrow from such experience.\u201d\n\nFor ex-lawmaker, Kaze, \u201cthe question on the minds of many Nigerians in view of the degenerating situation is whether there will be elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cBut the point is that for anybody to contemplate not holding election in 2023 should not be an option. Holding elections in 2023 is a matter that cannot be compromised.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts express fears\n\nBut experts in security matters are expressing fears.\n\nSecurity analyst, Ben Okezie, is afraid that already the insecurity in the land presents a gloomy picture.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe is emphatic that if the situation persists with no conscious efforts at stopping it doom might follow.\n\n\u201cAfter my thorough analysis of the situation,\u201d he says, \u201cmy conclusion is that the security situation ahead of 2023 elections looks gloomy.\n\n\u201cFirst, the military came out to say that they discovered some people were putting on military uniforms for political purposes. That shows you that the bad boys will be out there to cause harm at elections time.\n\n\u201cIt follows that if some people are wearing security personnel\u2019s uniforms, they must also be armed. Now, we can see the number of arms that were alleged to have disappeared from the police amoury unaccounted for?\n\n\u201cNow, consider that a former military head of state General Abdulsalami Abubakar alleged that over six million illegal weapons are in various hands. So, what we are saying now is that there is so much illegal arms in the hands of non-state actors and our security agencies do not know in whose hands those arms are.\u201d\n\nIt is his considered view that \u201cwith what we are going on now, it might not be palatable for the country, especially the security agencies.\u201d\n\nHe went on to outline the developments which point to the danger he sees ahead.\n\n\u201cLook at the killings everywhere, even in places where one doesn\u2019t expect such. Look at the killing of an Oba in Ogun State. Look at what is happening in Zamfara, Plateau, Imo, Katsina and Kaduna states. Look at violence everywhere. All these are clear pointers to what to expect when the elections come.\u201d\n\nLet govt mop up illegal arms\n\nAhead of the elections, Okezie wants all \u201csecurity agencies to as a matter of urgency begin now to mop up illegal arms in every local government in the country. And who are the ones to help them? Retired security agents \u2013 the army, police, DSS.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t mop up all the illegal arms, we are just joking. Arms speak power everywhere. Everything should be done about this; they should be fast about it. Once arms are out of the way, our security agencies can handle every other challenge. Arm in the arms of a child is dangerous. But if he doesn\u2019t have that, you can draw his ears and ask him to kneel down and he obeys.\u201d\n\nRichard Amuwa former secretary, Association of Licenced Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria insists \u201cthe insecurity situation we have at the moment is a major challenge.\u201d\n\nAmuwa who works with Mega Guards Services Ltd says he has observed that insecurity during elections in Nigeria follow a trend.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has always been part of our challenges, and has continued to be so. One hopes it wouldn\u2019t go higher than what we have at the moment.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that because in \u201cevery election year, we always have loud talks about insecurity and how it is going to be. But I don\u2019t exercise any fear, although I know that insecurity presently is a major challenge.\u201d\n\nHowever, he expressed fears that \u201cif something else is added to it, that will be a huge disaster.\u201d\n\nLets recruit more security personnel\n\nRecruitment of more staff for various security outfits, for Dr Nwoye, is the way right way to go in addressing the situation at hand right now.\n\n\u201cWe need to recruit more security personnel. From my experience, our security numbers are abysmal compared to our population. Something has to be done about this. The number of policemen and other security agencies cannot police what is going on now. And so, what we have now has to change. Government has to look at recruitment and training of new officers.\u201d\n\nAllow citizens bear arms\n\nDr Nwoye suggested that the government allows the citizenry to bear arms and defend themselves.\n\nHis words: \u201cOn the alternative, let\u2019s consider what Governor Aminu Masari has said. If it becomes clear that we don\u2019t have enough personnel to defend us as a nation, then allow the people to procure their own arms. There is no reason criminals would be running around and killing people in cold blood while law-abiding citizens remain defenceless \u2013 all because we don\u2019t have enough personnel to defend us.\n\n\u201cLet there be more talks on private citizens legally obtaining arms to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, he advised politicians going on their campaigns to be very careful.\n\n\u201cBut how careful can you be?\u201d he asked, adding \u201cthat\u2019s where we have come to be.\u201d\n\nHow private security agent can help\n\nIn Amuwa\u2019s opinion, government can leverage on hundreds of private securities agencies in the country to fight insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe have over five million guards. Government can find a way to work with them. They can supply information to our security agencies and that will be a good collaborative effort.\n\n\u201cInsecurity happens in every community. If there is a guard in a community, and they see people gathering with arms, they can always report.\n\n\u201cBut we have a situation where the security personnel are not working with private security personnel; that is not very good,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic education very important\n\nAmuwa is also of the opinion that \u201cwe need to educate the citizenry on what to do when the politicians come up with their crazy stuffs.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cwe need to educate our communities to stay safe because arms proliferation, use of thugs \u2013 all of them will constitute insecurity challenges in 2023.\u201d\n\nHis sentiments were shared by Hon Kaze who also expressed the need to \u201cspeak to our people; we should speak to Nigerians because the insecurity level we have now is intolerable; this government has failed us; they have failed much more than every other government before now, civilian or military.\u201d",

          "title": "Controversy trails Abuja rice pyramid show",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen, Olakunle Olafioye (Lagos) and John Adams (Minna)\n\nIt was a moment of joy in the penultimate week as the Federal Government unveiled the Central Bank of Nigeria/RIFAN Paddy Pyramids in Abuja.\n\nNigerians who saw the heaps of rice were happy. Since then, many have started saying goodbye to hunger, which has become common in many households in the country. The new hope is that local rice will soon flood the Nigerian markets. But that may be a pipe dream as there are many who despite the cheers and new hope believe that the Abuja rice show was a scam\n\nSenator Hanga Rufai is one of the stakeholders in rice production in Kano State. Speaking with Sunday Sun in a telephone interview, he dismissed the unveiling of the rice pyramid in Abuja as a scam.\n\nAccording to him, the bulk of the rice they showcased was imported from the neighbouring countries to augment the small quantity produced locally in Nigeria so that they could cover up the money they have stolen from the Anchor Borrower Programme.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a scam. In a situation where bandits did not allow people to go to the farms, how could they have produced such a huge quantity of rice they showcased? Even where the bandits allowed farmers to farm, they didn\u2019t allow them to harvest. In some cases, they went and razed their farms with fire. Not up to 20 per cent of our land last year and the year before was cultivated because of this banditry that is all over the Northwest.\n\n\u201cIt is a scam because the Anchor Borrowers coordinators were stealing the money. The arrangement is for the farmers to produce rice commensurate with the money given to them, but at the end of the farming season, the coordinators of the Anchor Borrowers programme were seen running helter-skelter looking for rice to buy both internally and from foreign countries so much that a bag of rice which was hitherto sold for N10,000 went up to about N17,000 in the market. So, the rice they showcased was not actually produced in Nigeria, the bulk of it was imported from neighbouring countries like Niger, Benin Republic, and Burkina Faso.\n\n\u201cKano is one of the largest producers of rice in Nigeria, we know what happened. We were there physically when they were buying rice in the market. There was production of rice, but not to the volume they showcased. If they said they produced one million tons, I am sure they did not produce up to 1000 tons.\n\n\u201cI have a large farm but didn\u2019t have enough money to produce. So, I saw the Anchor Borrowers programme as an opportunity and showed interest to borrow. They featured thousands of us, but eventually, they gave about 100 of us. Each person got one bag of manure, one sprayer, a container of chemical, which was largely water, and one bag of fertilizer. I saw it as a scam and returned the items.\n\n\u201cThe input they provided for farmers was for subsistence farming and the money they released did not reach the farmers because the leaders of the Anchor Borrowers programme stole the money. Before the former Minister of Agriculture was fired, I went to him and advised him to report the matter to the CBN, but he refused. Eventually, the president sacked him.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a scam. And you know that our man (Mr President) takes anything they tell him. But Nigerians know that this is a scam. The very poor people of this country know that they didn\u2019t produce this rice pyramid. If it was produced here in Nigeria, how did a bag of rice jump from N10,000 to N28,000 or N29,000 during Christmas? So, the ordinary people were competing with them (leaders of Anchor Borrowers Programme) to buy rice in the market.\n\n\u201cThe programme should have been run by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with the states. That way, there would be competition among states. But at the end of it all, everything turned out to be a scam. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, rice dealers in some parts of Lagos State have criticized the Federal Government over its claim of availability of locally grown rice in the country, describing the claim as false and misleading. Some of the traders who spoke to Sunday Sun said the pictures of rice pyramid which the government boasted so much about was not real.\n\nWhen Sunday Sun correspondent visited some areas in the state, including Agege, Ipaja, Alagbado and Ogba, most dealers claimed that they did not have local rice in their stores while the few who had said they only have limited supplies and offered to sell it at marginally cheap price compared to foreign rice.\n\nA dealer in Alagbado area of the state, Joel Oganiru, told Sunday Sun that a bag of locally grown rice costs 26,500 while the same quantity of foreign rice sold for between N27, 800 and N29, 000.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cI have less than one bag (of locally grown rice) at the moment but if you would like to buy half a bag it is N13, 250. A bag sells for N26, 500,\u201d Oganiru said.\n\nThe dealer also confirmed that he had equally seen the purported rice pyramid on social media but said there was scarcity of the brand the last time he tried to replenish his stock. \u201cMay be they have not shipped it to Lagos,\u201d he reasoned.\n\nThe story was not different at Agege and Ipaja-Ayobo area of the state where another rice dealer had to make three different calls to his fellow dealers before he was able to ascertain the availability of the local brand of the rice which he offered to sell at N26, 800 per bag and on the condition that the correspondent would have to wait for about 30 minutes before the product would be brought to his shop.\n\nIn Niger State, only 20 per cent of the N6.5 billion given out to farmers in Niger State under the Central Bank of Nigeria Anchor Borrowers loan being jointly supervised by the apex bank and Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) have so far been recovered from rice farmers in the state.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2019, the CBN through RIFAN, Niger State chapter, approved and disbursed the said amount as loans to 32,500 rice farmers in the state.\n\nThis loan, according to the Chairman of RIFAN in the state, Mallam Idris Abini were given in form of farmer implements and equipment, ranging from water pumps and accessories, rice seeds, sprayers, fertilizers, pre-emergency herbicides and post-emergency herbicides.\n\nHe revealed that the 20 per cent loan recovered so far in the state was made possible by the new policy introduced by CBN to appoint an individual as coordinator between the RIFAN, CBN and the farmers, and all farm inputs and equipment would be channelled through the person.\n\nHe pointed out that all the 32,500 beneficiaries of the loan in the state were made to pay 20 per cent of items given to them as equity through the coordinator, who served as a guarantor, adding that the policy was introduced by the CBN in 2019 when the farmers refused to pay back their loan.\n\n\u201cAll items were given to the coordinator, who served as guarantor between the farmers, CBN and RIFAN. That policy has kept the programme going since 2019 till date. The CBN in its wisdom decided not to shut the door on Niger State because of her potential in rice production so it introduced the policy, and an individual was appointed to be in-charge of special RIFAN projects.\n\nExplaining implementation modality of the new policy, Abini said: \u201cAll the inputs will be given to the Coordinator based on the number of registered farmers under him and they pay 20 per cent of the value of the items given to them as equity.\u201d\n\nHe added that since the policy was introduced in 2019, about N195 million had been recovered from about 9,500 farmers who have benefited from the loan.\n\nHowever, due to the policy and commitment towards the loan repayment shown by the state RIFAN since 2019, as contained in it reports recently presented to the National Headquarters of RIFAN, the state is being considered for the dry season funding.\n\nAbini said about 65,000 hectares of rice farms is being cultivated by farmers in the state every year, producing an estimated 260,000 metric tons of rice in the state.\n\nHe, therefore, attributed the current high cost of the commodity to hoarding by the middlemen who want to exploit Nigerians and paint the present administration in a bad light of not doing enough in the area of rice production, stressing that \u201cit is purely act of sabotage by some few individuals.\u201d",

          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nRenowned academic and tactical politician, Prof Tunde Adeniran, was former Minister of Education, former Ambassador of Nigeria to Germany, as well as the chairman of the defunct Directorate for Social Mobilization (MAMSER).\n\nHe was also a former member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before his defection to the Social Democratic Party in 2018.\n\nHe left partisan politics in 2020, after serving as the national chairman of the SDP, a position he took over from Chief Olu Falae (former finance minister and presidential candidate).\n\nIn this exclusive chat with Sunday Sun, the celebrated scholar, spoke on critical national issues, including delay in electoral bill, petroleum subsidy, zoning and the president that Nigeria needs in 2023. Excerpt:\n\nLatest Transparency International (TI) report on corruption index on Nigeria is again damning. What is your reaction to it?\n\nI believe the report is worrisome, it shows that we still have a long way to go and unless we tackle it head-on, it will continue to haunt us and we need to be very decisive about our national policy or determination to fight corruption because it is all over the place, in the political, the economy, in fact, in all areas of our national life. We really need to tackle it and what is worrisome about it is that when you see the younger generation not giving much hope and thinking that that has become a way of life then that becomes more disturbing. So, I think it is an issue we really need to tackle head-on. It is something that we can conquer; we can put an end to it if we are so determined. It means that we have to work it out together within our various systems, dealing with it in our daily life, in our public and private life. We need to deal with it because if we don\u2019t deal with it, it will not go away on its own.\n\nWhat do we really need to do? Is it that the culprits do not receive appropriate punishment?\n\nThat is part of what I mean because it is becoming increasingly fashionable for people who have been alleged to have cheated the public or an institution to feel that it is something normal and some even celebrate it, giving impression that it is a show of, look, we have become big men. It is really a tragedy because they believe that when they do it they will go away with it and they do it with impunity, but if they are well sanctioned, if adequately punished there will be an end to it. When they are really sanctioned and the courts do not adjoin endlessly and without coming up with judgments that are ridiculous, then things will gradually begin to fall in line. Once justice is done and offenders are made to face the music, then it will serve as deterrent to others.\n\nThere is this issue of Electoral Act being delayed. Are you worried?\n\nI do not believe that the Electoral Act should take as much time as it is taking to have its finality. When people begin to see this type of delay it gives a signal that there is something wrong somewhere, maybe that some people are trying to play games, maybe that some people are trying to manipulate to favour their political lining etc. We should not be doing things in such a way that every situation creates tension. Nigeria does not deserve all this, it is most unfortunate this is something that is so straightforward that ought to have been handled with transparency and decisiveness, and there is no need for all these rigmarole.\n\nAlready, there is a parade of presidential hopeful from the different political parties for the 2023 presidential battle. Are you satisfied with the stuff you have seen so far?\n\nSo far I am not particularly satisfied because I believe that this country has a lot of human resources. We are not just endowed with mineral resources alone, God in His mercy gave this country a lot of materials, in terms of human resources and they should come out and serve this country. The more the merrier, once the people see many more people with the capacity to turn things around for better in this country joining the race they will have confidence that the future indeed will be better than today. So, we are expecting that more people will definitely come out to join the race so that the people will be able to make more informed choices based on their antecedents, based on their vision, based on their capacity, their competence and, of course, based on their ability to understand and appreciate what is on ground and what it will take to turn things around for Nigerians and the Nigerian nation.\n\nNigerian politics today seem to be a struggle between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Do we really need a Third Force if there must be something different?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nI believe what has been lacking all along is the absence of an ideologically-rooted party, a party that is based on clear ideology. When you talk about the APC and the PDP today being the dominant party, yes they are dominant, yet at the same time people are walking in and out of both parties because there is no difference. That is why today you can hardly tell in some cases who belongs to which party. Today, you think they are in the APC, tomorrow you discover they are not. There is no clear-cut ideological distinction between those two parties; they are just mere vehicles for winning positions. What is different is just the name, but people within those parties in terms of their philosophy and ideological orientation there is no difference.\n\nThe government has shifted subsidy removal to another 18 months, while some say it\u2019s victory for Nigerians; some are of the view that its postponement of the doomsday. What is your view on it?\n\nWell, if some people see it as the extension of the doomsday they have their reasons. I think it is really unfortunate that you cannot do some things and get positive result or effect out of it unless you sacrifice some other good things also. It should be possible to remove the subsidy and at the same time not having the type of negative consequences that people anticipate and which ordinarily and normally will also happen, simply because we have not put in place measures that will address the consequences of subsidy removal. Subsidy, it has been stated over and over that it is a fraud, it is fraudulent, it is a rip-off of the Nigerian people and the Nigerian nation, so it has been carefully thought out that it is time to remove it, but yet, it cannot be removed now because if you do the burden will also be burn by the people who have all along been suffering from the subsidy. Money that should be used to develop the communities, build infrastructure, improve the quality of life of the people are being siphoned to the so-called subsidy. So, it\u2019s most unfortunate, but one believes that okay, let them enjoy another era of the subsidy within when Nigeria will be liberated from it. I believe it cannot continue forever, so it has to go.\n\nWhat exactly is your take on zoning concerning the country today and the different strategies from different zones? Do you have sympathy for any zone to take the presidency in 2023?\n\nWell, anybody has a right to be strategizing to become anything; it depends on the value of the various parties and then their orientation, which direction they want to go. One thing I have said which I believe in is that we have to think more of people with competence, people with capacity, people who know what it will take to turn things around for this country. Within that context you know that when you look at any zone you get some competent people. At the same time, you look and say okay because of the mood of the country you cannot just say okay some people have done it and that let them just continue because they are competent and all that. People feel or think that there should be a shift and then this shift will also be based on not just any character, like some of the people that we are getting now. We have to get people that Nigerians will have confidence in, those they can trust. People that can deliver, people that will represent competence, people that will represent a new change for the Nigerian people and the Nigerian nation, a new direction. I am resolute and committed to having an ideologically-oriented leadership that will be able to lead this country out of the woods.\n\nThere is this speculation in the political circle that your party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is one of the parties that will provide platform for National Consultative Front (NCFront)\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) I don\u2019t belong to any political party now. I left partisan politics since 2020, when I resigned as the national chairman, of the Social Democratic Party. Since then, I am not a member of any political party, but I belong to the group, the orientation that believes that we need to get this country on a very solid base and to do this we need a strong ideology that will be people-oriented.\n\nWhat is your take on the security challenge in the country?\n\nI am not happy and I am not satisfied with what is on ground in terms of security. The protection of lives and property is the first and most important responsibility of any government. I believe that we can do much more. A number of steps are being taken by the government, but I believe that we need to do much more. We should create the type of environment that will mobilise the entire nation to ensure an end to this insecurity. By that I mean that those who will work and ensure that we are all secured are not just the military, not just the police or the security agencies, but each and every one of us must have to be involved in it at different levels. It means that all of us will be able to make meaningful contributions to securing ourselves, protecting ourselves and all that. When you go to some countries, by the time you land as a visitor, tourist or whoever, they know that you are there and you are monitored here and there. In Nigeria today anybody comes in and goes out, so many things happen, people are trooping in with weapons of destruction, our people are being murdered and massacred here and there, abduction takes place on a daily basis, school children can no longer go to school for fear of being kidnapped, people cannot be on their farms for fear of being kidnapped, people are in their houses they cannot sleep well because they don\u2019t know what will happen next. That is not good. That should end. In the present situation, people are living in fear and this is not in any way good for our country. Without peace and good security, development cannot take place in an environment of insecurity.\n\nWhat kind of leadership do we need, and one that Nigerians should vote for in 2023?\n\nI want Nigerians to go for a leader that has the clear vision as to where Nigeria should go, who understands the entire dynamics of this country. A leader who will be able to unite the Nigerian people, a leader who will recognise our shortcomings and our goals and be decisive in solving those shortcomings, in resolving the crisis of basic trust among various groups in the country. we need one who will address the issues of not just insecurity, but mass unemployment, particularly among the young people. A person that will adequately address the issue of economic gaps which is a very serious one and, of course, the issue of justice and equity and development so that people will feel proud and happy that they are Nigerians, that there is no second class citizens in this country and that there is no marginalisation anymore and that people can achieve their ultimate goal because they are Nigerians.\n\nIn this choice, you think age should not be a barrier or should it?\n\nAs far as I am concerned you get to a point whereby you should not aspire for such an office that is so demanding, in terms of the energy needed. For instance, you cannot see or hear me saying again that I want to be president of this country because of the physical exertion that will be required. Of course, everybody has the right to come forward as far as you fall within the constitutional requirement, but I think the younger the better and not only that, it will be better when you have people with vision, capacity, commitment and the right orientation. But we should not also write-off people based on their age, we must consider antecedents and other factors to make informed choices.",

          "text": "\u2022$3.54bn joint venture debts offset since 2016\n\n\u2022$1.143bn still outstanding\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) paid an additional cash call arrears of $452,535,270 to its joint venture (JV) partners between November 2020 and November 2021, bringing to $3.54 billion the total debts it paid to the international oil companies (IOCs) since 2016, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nNew data from the national oil company indicated that among the five International Oil Companies (IOCs) being owed the backlog, Mobil Nigeria Producing and Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) had been fully settled as of November 31, 2021.\n\nThe figures gleaned from the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for January 2022, revealed that the two oil majors got a total of $833.7 million and $1.097 billion, respectively, since the arrears repayments started in 2016.\n\nHowever, a THISDAY analysis of the data showed that the NNPC still has an outstanding balance of $1.143 billion, according to the latest data, out of the negotiated total debt of $4.689 billion with the Joint Venture (JV) partners over five years ago.\n\nAside from Mobil and Chevron, other oil majors that are being owed arrears by the NNPC include Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Total Energies and Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC).\n\nWhile the SPDC has been paid $680.6 million so far, with an outstanding $691.9 million out of the initial $1.37 billion owed, Total as of November 31, 2021, had been paid $411.73 million with a balance of $199.2 million, out of total debt of $610.97 million.\n\nFurthermore, with an initial debt of $774.6 million owed NAOC, payment to date made to the oil company was $522.6 million, with an outstanding of $252 million.\n\nThe NNPC, in 2016, signed a cash call repayment agreement with its JV partners to defray cash-call arrears within five years after many years of its indebtedness to its partners.\n\nBefore then it had consistently for years failed to meet its indebtedness to the IOCs, a situation the operators said caused loss of new investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAt the time, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources had negotiated a discount with the IOCs, comprising SPDC, Total, Mobil, Chevron and Agip from about $5.1 billion down to $4.68 billion and had since then continued to reduce the debt payments in instalments.\n\nThe NNPC further explained that in the case of SPDC, repayment was from the price balance distribution on Project Santolina; while in the case of CNL, repayment was from price balance distribution on Projects Cheetah and Falcon.\n\n\u201cNNPC has fully repaid its cash call arrears to MPN and all incremental barrels have reverted to base,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe cash call arrangements, under which NNPC had to pay for its 55 per cent to 60 per cent share of investment in the upstream joint ventures, had been in place for over 40 years before it was restructured.\n\nRecently, President Muhammadu Buhari had declared that the reforms initiated by his administration in 2015 when he took office, including the JV renegotiations, succeeded in saving the oil and gas industry in the country from total collapse.\n\nBuhari noted that, for instance, the payments of huge cash call backlog owed the country\u2019s JV partners took off a huge burden from the NNPC, saying that the current transparency drive in the national oil company was a product of those critical restructurings.\n\nThe president lamented that the sector which accounts for a huge source of foreign exchange for Nigeria, was in dire straits when he took over.\n\n\u201cWhen we were elected into office in 2015, the industry was in a very dire situation worsened by a backlog of Joint Venture (JV) Cash Call arrears.\n\n\u201cThe industry needed reforms to attract more investments and attract the needed revenue to support the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cAs a new administration, we needed to act fast to address the declining prospects of the industry and aggressively drive economic recovery and improve the country,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nAside from the cash call presentation before the joint committee, the NNPC in its data further explained that it would deduct N127 billion during next month\u2019s FAAC, for what it termed under-recovery.\n\nBut the N127 billion February projected petrol subsidy payment (for January) is far less than the N270 billion netted off the company\u2019s revenue in December 2021, accounting for the highest under-recovery paid yet.\n\n\u201cThe November 2021 value shortfall recovery on the importation of PMS (petrol) amounted to N270,831,143,856.56. The recovery consists of the November 2021 value shortfall of N220.110.853.427.56, plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N50,720,290,429.00 for October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N127.035,585.354.25 is to be recovered from January 2022 proceed due for sharing at the February 2022 FAAC meeting,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the information, the overall NNPC crude lifting of 8.31 million barrels (export & domestic crude) in November 2021 recorded a 7.78 per cent increase relative to the 7.71 barrels lifted in October 2021.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that Nigeria recorded an average production of 1.27 million barrels per day in November/December, while crude oil and gas export revenue received in December 2021 amounted to $5.13 million and $40.14 million respectively.\n\nNigeria LNG feedstock gas receipt was $113.39 million, including receipts of $51.85 million which slipped to December that ought to have been received in November 2021.\n\nFor other receipts, the NNPC data showed that the sum of $62.35 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas fees, as well as interest income was received in December 2021.\n\nIn addition, the sum of N352,518.463,538.25 was the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue for December, while strategic holding cost and pipeline repairs amounted to N3,976,516,985.27 even as product losses amounted to N3,307,613,578.863.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Plan to throw presidential ticket open, ridiculous, says PANDEF\n\n\u2022Middle Belt Forum vows to mobilise against any northern presidential candidate\n\n\u2022Be ready to collapse, Ohanaeze Ndigbo tells main opposition party\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nCondemnations have trailed the alleged plan by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to shun the clamour for power shift from the North to the South in 2023.\n\nWhile the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has vowed to mobilise against any political party that fields a northerner as its presidential candidate, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo has stated that PDP\u2019s plan to throw the presidential ticket open would lead to the eventual collapse of the opposition party.\n\nOn its part, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described PDP\u2019s move as ridiculous.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the main opposition party, Mr Debo Ologunagba, had reportedly declared that the party would not stop northern presidential aspirants from contesting, adding that the party would leave the presidential ticket open to all the geopolitical zones.\n\nReacting to this development, the President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, told THISDAY that the Northern region has no moral right to contest next year\u2019s presidential election after the eight years of President Mohammadu Buhari.\n\nHe vowed that the Middle Belt and South regions would mobilise against any political party that selects a northerner as its presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe PDP statement, I understand was from the Publicity Secretary of the party. The final statement will come from its National Chairman after a National Working Committee (NWC) or National Executive Council (NEC) meeting.\n\n\u201cI believe the PDP will see the reason why it should not present a northern candidate, knowing also that the Middle Belt Forum and the South strongly advocate the mobilisation of their members to work against any political party that selects a northerner as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe need to address our security and development issues, and the North does not have the moral right to the presidency after eight years of President Buhari,\u201d he explained.\n\nBe Ready for a Requiem, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Tells Main Opposition Party\n\nOn its part, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday described PDP\u2019s plan to throw its presidential ticket open as the most unfortunate decision that if not quickly reversed would lead to the eventual collapse of the opposition party.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia in an interview with THISDAY said it was sad that the party had refused to reciprocate the kind gesture of the people of the South-east over the years.\n\nWhile describing the current agitation for the emergence of the next president from the South-east zone as one based on equity, Ogbonnia said the organisation remained unfazed in its agitation.\n\n\u201cI must tell you that we feel so bad that a party that has enjoyed tremendous support of the Igbos would come out boldly to throw the presidency open not minding our very just and fair agitation.\n\n\u201cFrom 1999 till date, we have continued to support the PDP. In 1999, despite what the party did to our leader, Dr Alex Ekwueme, we still supported Obasanjo. In 2007, we supported Yar\u2019Adua, sustained the support for Jonathan. And today, the best way to pay us back is for the party to throw its ticket open. This is very unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman further noted that the Igbo nation will sustain its agitation until such a time when the whole world will come to the reality that we must have the presidency.\n\n\u201cToday, we have so many of our people who have declared their intention to seek the presidency of the country come 2023, that\u2019s to show you how ready we are,\u201d he said.\n\nOgbonnia however warned that should the PDP refuse to change its decision and reserve the ticket for only candidates from the South-east, it must be ready to face a requiem.\n\n\u201cThis will certainly be the end of PDP. They still have the opportunity of doing the needful. If they fail to do the right thing, it will be the end of the party. From 1999 till date, the other two legs of the tripod have had the presidency, the Hausas, the Yorubas have had their fair share, Even the South-south have had their share and yet the Igbos are treated with levity,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso reacting, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described as ridiculous the move by the main opposition party to jettison zoning and throw open the 2023 presidential race to all interested aspirants.\n\nThe group also said it would watch and see how far the party can go with the arrangement.\n\nPANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, made the position of the group known in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say, it\u2019s a ridiculous decision. We have sufficiently made our position known on this matter. We\u2019ll wait to see how it will go,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Welfare of average Nigerian paramount to ruling party, says Osinbajo\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nBarring any unforeseen circumstance, the National Caretaker Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by the Yobe State Governor, Mallam Mai Mala Buni, will meet this week on the zoning of all the party offices, ahead of the party\u2019s February 26 national convention, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is coming as the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has disclosed that the ruling party would remain committed to the welfare of the common man.\n\nA member of the CECPC told THISDAY at the weekend that the caretaker committee would also set up a zoning committee to address the issue of the zoning of the party\u2019s elective positions.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning committee will consider equity and justice before coming up with its position on zoning.\n\nThe CECPC member, who urged members of the party to ignore all former reports of zoning, also described such reports as fake.\n\nHe said that the expected zoning committee would be guided by justice and fairness by ensuring that all zones and states are fairly represented.\n\nWhen asked whether the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the APC would be summoned to approve the zoning arrangement before implementation, he said the Buni-led committee would play the dual role of the NWC and NEC of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are a child of circumstance. We are playing two roles in one. CECPC is playing the role of both the working committee and the NEC.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any NEC meeting, but we are working with the governors of the party and others to ensure that everything about the convention is set on course and that there will be no trouble. We shall deliver a smooth and transparent convention.\n\n\u201cAfter our meeting this week, every doubting person will keep quiet. At the end of the day, because there is no NEC, the report of the zoning committee will be sent to the President who is the leader of the party and the governors for their perusal and advice and we are set to go for the February 26 date,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, one of the chairmanship aspirants, Mr Saliu Mustapha has insisted that the North-central geopolitical zone should produce the next national chairman of the APC. \u201cIt is for balancing and equity. We are the bridge linking the North and South,\u201d he said.\n\nWelfare of Average Nigerian Paramount to Ruling Party, Says Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Osinbajo has disclosed that the ruling APC would remain committed to the welfare of the common man.\n\nHe attributed this to the party being that of the people and the resolve of the APC to continually ensure that the common man benefits maximally from the government.\n\nOsinbajo, according to a statement issued yesterday by his Media Assistant, Mr Laolu Akande, made this disclosure when he played host to a delegation of the APC Professionals Forum at the State House, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThis is a party of the common man, a party of the people, a party that takes as its cradle, the importance of ensuring that the common man benefits maximally from the government which is why we have the big programmes like the Social Investment Programmes, the largest of its kind in the continent and several of such other programmes that emphasise how serious we take the lot of the common man\u201d.\n\nReminiscing on the party\u2019s formation about nine years ago, the VP noted that APC has made an impact and it is determined to improve the well-being of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the party is also where many young people are, stressing that \u201cwe are the ruling party in Africa\u2019s largest democracy, which by itself is a phenomenal achievement for such a young party.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll find that in the particular ideological direction of our party, it\u2019s one that was clear to the founders of the party, the initial persons and groups that came together to form the party and they came from different parties, but it was to present a left of centre, a social democratic alternative to the ruling party.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo further stated that the APC is determined to ensure the country\u2019s further growth and development, noting that the party carries with it, the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe party is not a mere platform for running for political office, it carries with it the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians and we must make it a place where they are comfortable, a place where they feel this belongs to us. We can even put our resources into it; it is not just for politicians; it is for us all.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said leaders and politicians are there to serve the people and give them reasons to believe in a better country.\n\n\u201cOur people, the Nigerian people, need hope; they need to be able to believe in the politicians; they need to be able to believe in their leaders and if the leaders are within the political party, that political party must have an ideology that is attractive to them, that makes them feel wanted, that makes them feel cared for and I think that role is so crucial.\n\n\u201cIt is the role this Professional Forum must take on to itself. And what it entails aside from that logical objective of the forum; what it entails is defining in writing in various ways what our party stands for.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the significance of the APC Professionals Forum in the scheme of things, the vice president urged the Forum to play more important roles in shaping the party\u2019s ideology.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are many people that say well, we have not done this, we have not done that. There are so many ways of looking at it, but the truth of the matter is that the party was committed and is seen across the country as a party of the common man, which is why I think the role of the Professionals Forum is particularly important because we are trying to shape the ideology of the party\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that professionals are integral to ensuring the party stays focused on the wellbeing of Nigerians and its ideals, as stated in the Constitution and manifesto, respectively.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the professionals cannot do that, then our party becomes all comers, anything goes so long as we have a platform to run for political office. But I think that we, especially professionals, have a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cWe have many who have run their businesses, who have professional organisations or who have excelled in their professions and we know that the only way to do things properly is if we can press on without relenting.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo further hoped that the APC Professionals Forum will also carry the hopes and expectations of millions of the party\u2019s supporters nationwide.\n\nHe also believed that the Forum, made up of professional elites, will be of great benefit to the party and Nigeria because of its leadership and quality of professionals on its board of trustees and as members, who he noted \u201care not just politicians, but people who have distinguished themselves\u201d in their respective fields.\n\n\u201cI think our party will rely a great deal on this forum and I hope and pray that the Forum will realise all of its objectives, including the extra ones that our party must place upon you, especially at this time in the life and history of our dear country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Say over 20 churches burnt, several houses, businesses destroyed\n\nInsist 110 abducted Chibok schoolgirls still unaccounted for since 2014, after 57 escaped from captivity\n\nBy Michael Olugbode\n\nThe people of Chibok local government area of Borno State have decried the neglect of their area by the government, which has left them vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks.\n\nChibok got famous when on April 14, 2014 Boko Haram invaded a school in the community, abducting over 270 schoolgirls.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja on Saturday, Kibaku Area Development Association (KADA), an association of people from Chibok local government area of Borno State, lamented that since the break out of insurgency attacks over a decade ago, their area had been attacked over 72 times, with over 407 persons killed.\n\nThe group also lamented that over 332 persons had been abducted in the council, over 20 churches burnt, unquantifiable houses and businesses burnt, vehicles stolen and grains barns burnt or destroyed by the terrorist group.\n\nThe group, which was led to the press conference by the National President of KADA, Dauda Iliya said: \u201cWe are on behalf of the entire Chibok Community, using this medium to once again call on President Muhammadu Buhari to rescue Chibok Community, an ethnic nationality, from total annihilation by the Boko Haram Terrorists. This is because since the mass abduction of our 276 daughters in April, 2014, wherein 57 escaped (on their own) we still have 110 of them still unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cThe parents and the Community have continued to be subjected to persistent and sustained attacks, killings, abductions, maiming, arsons and other myriads of criminality without adequate government protection. Chibok has been for all intents and purposes abandoned to its own devices by all layers of government in Nigeria.\n\nRight from late 2012 up to this time, the statistics of the state of damage and destruction of lives and property inflicted on the Community presents a worrisome and pathetic picture.\u201d\n\nThey alleged that: \u201cFrom late 2018 to date, the frequency of attacks and level of destruction have escalated and are simply alarming. Just this year (2022) alone, Kautikari (second largest town in Chibok area) was attacked on January 14 with five girls abducted, three persons killed, many houses and churches burnt, etc. In sustaining their carnage, Piyemi, another big town in Chibok area, was attacked on January 20 with 19 persons (mostly girls) abducted and one person, the Vigilante leader, beheaded!\u201d\n\nThey added that: \u201cThe town was practically razed down and virtually all the recently harvested agricultural produce completely burnt down and/or looted. Chibok is predominantly an agrarian community and the whole year\u2019s harvests have been lost to these sustained and targeted attacks posing serious food security concerns in the community.\n\n\u201cWe call on all well-meaning Nigerians and Mr. President in particular, to rise up to the occasion and urgently save our people from total annihilation and starvation.\u201d\n\nThey asked government to synergize with security forces in confronting the menace so as to end the sustained carnage on the people of Chibok and facilitate the return of the remaining 110 daughters abducted in 2014 and numerous others subsequently abducted at different times; for the immediate setting up of IDP Camps in Chibok town and provide Chibok with skills acquisition centre so as to avoid imminent hunger/starvation.\n\nThey also requested the federal government to order deployment of more military personnel as well as better arms to Chibok to halt the continuous attacks on the community and plead with Borno State Governor to do more in organizing and helping the people of the area in securing the state in general and Chibok in particular from attacks.\n\nThey condoled the Nigerian Army for the loss of gallant soldiers including the very brave Brigadier General B. K. Zirkushu who lost their lives in Askira protecting the people against the invading terrorists on November 13, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Osinbajo: Only Leaders Not Inspired by Personal Profit Can Bring about National Transformation",
          "text": "* Asserts Nigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday took a deep look at the countless problems bedeviling Nigeria and declared that only people not inspired by personal profit could bring about the desired national transformation in the country.\n\nOsinbajo, who was speaking in Abuja at the 1st Annual General Assembly of Catholics in Politics and Catholic Business Leaders, also highlighted the imperative of servant leadership and transformational leadership at different levels in society as a force for the common good.\n\nHe said: \u201cHistory teaches us that everywhere there has been a national transformation, it has been brought about by public-spirited men and women of goodwill who, inspired by their belief in a higher purpose other than their own profit, have entered the public square to champion the common good.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said transformational leadership, particularly in a multi-ethnic and multi-faceted country like Nigeria, \u201cis needed\u201d across all levels of government and spheres of society, as its primary focus is the pursuit of the common good to ensure fairness, justice, unity and development in a nation.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cbuilding credible institutions of justice, the rule of law and orderly society are crucial expressions of the pursuit of the common good.\u201d\n\nRecalling the words of His Holiness Pope John Paul II during his visit to Nigeria in February 1982 in an address at the State House in Lagos, the VP stated, \u201conly the harnessing of all the forces for the common good, in true respect of the supreme values of the spirit, will make a nation great and a happy dwelling place for its people.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President stated that the common good as an imperative of public policy and governance was articulated by the second chapter of the Nigerian Constitution, adding, \u201cThe challenge of actualising the common good is coterminous with our quest to actualise the Directive Principles and Objectives of State Policy. Achieving both requires transformational leadership across all levels and spheres of our society.\u201d\n\nHighlighting why transformational leadership is critical to national life, the VP noted that it would spur positive changes across all sectors and spheres of society.\n\nHe added that as a model of leadership, transformational leadership operates by serving and uplifting others because it is servant leadership.\n\nThe VP noted: \u201cThe purpose of power is service, not domination; it is to uplift and empower others rather than to control or oppress. This is a model of leadership that is inseparable from our conception of the common good.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership is, therefore, the pursuit of the common good. But the pursuit of the common good itself is not as easy as it sounds. This is especially so where the wounds and enmities of ethnic and religious conflicts are deep.\n\n\u201cThe common type of leadership will seek the path of relevance and popularity within their own ethnic or religious camps by seeking only the good of their own. The servant-leader will serve his people by emphasising the letter and spirit of the gospel that even our worst enemies were still made in the image of God.\n\n\u201cAnd the pursuit of the common good is the pursuit of the good of those who hate us and have hurt us even in the recent past.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership means that we do not mourn and condemn the killing of those who belong to our own tribe or faith alone, or seek justice for ours alone, because all men are equal before God, and that the pain and anguish of a mother\u2019s loss of a child, is not different from one faith or tongue to the other.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways to cultivate the values that promote the common good (that seeks out the good of others) is in the delivery of justice and cementing the foundations of integrity in society, the Vice President noted.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe most progressive expressions of faith are concerned with justice and justice is impossible without taking the institutions that govern public life into account. In this sense, the purpose of governance and public policy is to establish a paradigm of justice that is measured by how well society deals with its most vulnerable members, settle disputes fairly and speedily, meting out punishment to violators of law without bias or fear.\n\n\u201cOur courts of law must be courts of justice. It means that we must pay attention to the quality and caliber of the men and women who are appointed judges. We must be concerned with their remuneration, and welfare. We must be unrelenting on insisting on their integrity.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also described corruption as a \u201ccancer\u201d noting that \u201cthe cancer in governments anywhere is corruption: \u201cWhen public officials, (be they high or low in the executive, legislature or judiciary) are toll gates for the extortion of the populace while seeking government dispensations, the common good, happy and prosperous lives for the people is impossible.\u201d\n\nHe added that the pursuit of the common good must \u201cinvolve a relentless pursuit of integrity and transparency of public officers: \u201cWe must think through the systems that will reduce human discretion in public-facing institutions. So we must, as a collective, condemn and call out corruption and corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also encouraged Nigerians not to despair, despite some of the challenges, but have hope and belief in the promise of a great nation while urging that Nigerians must be willing to pay the price to achieve national greatness by actively pursuing the common good of all, regardless of tribal and religious differences.\n\n\u201cFulfilling the immense promise of our nation requires men and women of goodwill from various communities and faiths to collaborate in advancing the common good. This is all the more important because it is such coalitions that can heal society of the wounds inflicted by the crude identity politics of religion and ethnicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur future will be shaped by how well we make common cause with other citizens of progressive persuasions to transform our communities,\u201d said the Vice President.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of forging collaborative partnerships, \u201cnot only within ourselves but with other forces which are committed to the common good to positively impact society.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo adds: \u201cOur greatest adversary in our task of national renewal is a feeling of hopelessness \u2013 a sense of futility that seems almost overwhelming. However, we cannot afford to even indulge in such despondency and despair. There is hope and there is much work to be done.\n\n\u201cNigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again. Contrary to opinion in some quarters, this house will not fall. It is being built and needs yet many more people to commit to building the sort of nation that we want. The throes and pangs of birth must not be interpreted as the pains of impending death. We are by the grace of God, more than able to overcome our present difficulties and we will overcome them.\u201d\n\nThe summit, otherwise known as the AGORA Conference, had as theme: \u201cThe Advancement of the Common Good towards Justice, Unity, Structure and Development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A president from the North is better because Northerners are better managers of the nation than southerners.\n\n\u201cThe North has demonstrated that there is no difference among them in the region. They don\u2019t show this is Fulani, this is Hausa, and this is this and that, unlike in the South. Northern people have managed the country better than Southerners.\n\n\u201cIf your enemy asks you to join him to scatter your father\u2019s house, can you support him to break your father\u2019s house? You shouldn\u2019t do that. But if he overshadows you and you help him to accomplish that, you would cry later.\n\n\u201cIt will be very difficult for a southerner to manage Nigeria the way a Northerner would. The Northerners that are ruling or governing were trained by our leaders that ruled the country before.\u201d\n\nBodejo also spoke on the grazing routes, adding that states should return areas earlier marked for reserves to herders.\n\nHe also accused Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, of \u201cplaying politics with the Fulani\u201d.\n\n\u201cOrtom wants to be a hero by force. After the end of his tenure, even to be a councillor in his village, he can\u2019t get it. He is doing politics with the Fulani.\n\n\u201cHe was the first person that called for the stoppage of Fulani from grazing their cattle, but we went to court to stop his evil plot and that is why he is running here and there, asking Buhari to declare Fulani organisations as terrorist groups,\" he said.",

We are facing our own just like Egypt did some years back and they are out of it now,\u201d the minister was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have the challenge of banditry, Boko Haram, and militants but that does not mean that Nigeria is at war.\n\n\u201cNigeria in the last six years has been making tremendous developmental progress in infrastructure development, agriculture, aviation and other fields of endeavour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the noise of the mischief makers have drowned the laudable success of the administration.\n\n\u201cI want to assure everyone of you here that whatever problem we have in Nigeria has nothing to do with religion or ethnicity.\u201d",

We are facing our own just like Egypt did some years back and they are out of it now,\u201d the minister was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have the challenge of banditry, Boko Haram, and militants but that does not mean that Nigeria is at war.\n\n\u201cNigeria in the last six years has been making tremendous developmental progress in infrastructure development, agriculture, aviation and other fields of endeavour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the noise of the mischief makers have drowned the laudable success of the administration.\n\n\u201cI want to assure everyone of you here that whatever problem we have in Nigeria has nothing to do with religion or ethnicity.\u201d",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian musician Buju wanted to reward his fans, so he created an NFT project",
          "text": "Towards the end of 2020, project lead of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d, Iyobosa Rehoboth, a creative director of Global Creative Operations (GCO), started brushing up on his knowledge of crypto. After learning extensively about ethereum and NFTs, he started selling the idea of an NFT project to several Nigerian music artistes.\n\nThe award-winning music director, popularly known as Prodigeezy, had initially created a design for a joint NFT project for the trio of Nigerian music superstars, Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy, but when he realised that getting the three of them to collaborate on something would be difficult, he abandoned the project.\n\nRehoboth presented his design to some other artistes, who rejected it, until he got it to a Nigerian musician, Daniel Benson, popularly known as Buju. \u201cBuju was open-minded. Having made tremendous progress with his career that year, he was keen on making his brand a global one,\u201d Prodigeezy said. Buju was also, at the time, working on a comic book idea, so it was fairly easy to convince him.\n\nBuju released the remix of \u201cItaly\u201d, featuring Blaq Diamond, with a colourful artwork of his head as the song\u2019s cover. He didn\u2019t want to release a full song, so he uploaded \u201cItaly\u201d to multiple streaming platforms. Before he knew it, it was making waves and, unknown to his many fans jamming to the song, the colourful art cover is in fact an unreleased NFT project.\n\nBuju had seen the NFT project as an opportunity to build a community around his fans, reward and connect with them like never before. \u201cI feel like it is something that people are going to enjoy. I\u2019m always working on a lot of recordings. I feel like it is the best way I could reward people that enjoy my music,\u201d Buju said.\n\nThis Sunday, on a Twitter Space, Buju and the team behind the project offered more details about his NFT project \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201c, a collection of 10,001 unique NFTs of his face. Holders of these NFTs would get perks like access to physical and virtual concerts hosted by Buju, merch items, and a part of the revenue the musician makes from specific music projects.\n\nBuju explained that he would drop more songs, mixtapes, and refixes, and that the project would motivate him to drop some of the songs he has been recording for years now. Buju said that he is always dropping snippets and imagines that holders of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d will be able to claim ownership of some of the snippets he drops.\n\nHe said that while he hasn\u2019t decided the arrangement for the sharing revenue with holders, holders will have a fraction of ownership of some of his songs, which will allow them to earn part of his streaming revenue.\n\nThe roadmap for the project, whose Discord channel has close to 4,500 members, is divided into 3 quarters for this year. More plans will be provided in quarter 1of 2023.\n\nfloats, an extended reality company under GCO, which is building the project, will start and intensify an educational campaign to teach people the fundamentals of blockchain, onboard people into crypto, help them set up a wallet, and educate them about the polygon network.\n\nIn this quarter, the \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d project will be minted publicly and pre-sale will start. It is then holders will begin to get some of the perks of the project. This includes access to PlaySpace, an AR filter for Snapchat and Instagram that takes users through Buju\u2019s career and also offers access to special events and interaction with Buju. Some of the other perks are an airdrop and a life membership mic that unlocks more possibilities in the metaverse and in real life.\n\nIn the second quarter, when Buju announces the release of his debut album, another limited collection of NFTs will be released, which will help holders unlock special access to Buju\u2019s concerts, events, and studio sessions. Merch items with virtual and physical utility will also be released, and some of the virtual merch will contain unlockable NFT content.\n\nThe HeadsByBuju project will dedicate 10% of its primary sales to a creator fund, and the entire community of holders will vote to decide what kind of creative project it would be. This creator fund will also be used to purchase some land in metaverses like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels.\n\nTo ensure that holders reap real-world benefits, the project is collaborating with restaurants, clubs, hotels, and health centres to provide discounts for holders.\n\nThe \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d team wants to build the project on the polygon network, instead of the ethereum network\u2014which NFT projects are usually based on\u2014because they want to get as many people as possible onboarded to the blockchain. While developing the project, the team spoke with prospective users and discovered that the biggest problem to getting onboarded into the space was ethereum\u2019s high gas fees\u2014the amount of money you pay to execute any command on the ethereum network. So, to make onboarding easier for their audience, some of whom are interacting with NFTs for the first time, they said they want a popular and efficient marketplace and less expensive protocol, and polygon ticked all the boxes.\n\nThis is perhaps the first time any African musician has tried to use crypto technology to establish a connection with fans and reward them.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Employers use the platform by uploading their employees and setting a budget. Employees can choose from over 100 Health Plans from top HMOs in Nigeria\u201d Olude told Techpoint at the event.\n\n\u201d roHealth is on a mission to increase access to healthcare in Nigerians by providing free health Insurance for a limited period. A lot of companies do not trust HMOs and believe that it does not provide value to their employees. We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlalekan Olude, roHealth CEO\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us it is a synergy having a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, their partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving them healthcare to them or covering them as part of their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that people use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy produce up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spend.\n\nSince its inception 4 months ago, over 7000 lives and 500 businesses actively use roHealth for making their health coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "title": "Using its credit analytics solution, Periculum wants to improve financial inclusion for Nigerians",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Amirah graduated from the Obafemi Awolowo University, she found it difficult to get a job despite her second class upper grade in economics. Six months into her search, she was getting frustrated. While hanging out with friends, one suggested that she start a tailoring business. As a student, she had made most of her dresses and even made some for her friends.\n\nThey were confident she could build a business out of her skill. But there was a problem. She needed to get a sewing machine but had burnt through her savings during her job search. She could ask her friends for a loan, but like her, they were also broke.\n\nWhile this is a fictional story, it paints a picture of numerous people in emerging markets like Nigeria. For Amirah, she could take out a loan, but only a few financial institutions would offer her one.\n\nAccess to credit is crucial for the growth of an economy. It gives access to consumers who would otherwise have been unable to afford certain products. However, no one gives out loans for fun. Financial institutions need to get these loans back with interest after a certain period and without a good enough guarantee of that, they will desist from granting these loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat has been the case in Nigeria, where commercial banks have shied away from granting loans to most people but instead focused on a few high net worth individuals. In the past few years, fintech startups like Carbon and FairMoney have sprung up looking to solve this problem using proprietary technology.\n\nWhile some focus on lending, others embed it as a part of their service offerings. Still, one similarity is their use of technology to determine the creditworthiness of customers before granting loans.\n\nImproving access to credit for underserved markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all organisations have this capability, and this is where Periculum believes it has found its sweet spot. Like many Nigerians have done in the past few years, Michael Temitope Collins moved to Canada for his university education, where he studied business administration and management at Thompson Rivers University.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at a couple of Canadian banks and started a few businesses himself. While working at these banks, he researched and discovered many underserved customers, even in Canada.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nHis research also showed that one reason for the problem was the inability of financial institutions to assess individuals and their creditworthiness accurately. With this knowledge, he built a solution \u2014 Periculum \u2014 using existing financial and non-financial datasets.\n\nThe startup, launched in 2019, has seen some traction, getting into Techstars Toronto in 2021 and raising a pre-seed round of $620,000 from investors such as Loyal VC, First Fund, and White Hibiscus Capital, which Collins says exceeded their initial goal of $500k. Although the startup has clients across three continents \u2014 Africa, South America, and North America \u2014 it plans to focus on Nigeria in the interim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe plan now is to build out a separate entity in Nigeria and focus strictly on the Nigerian market. The Nigerian market is unique; it\u2019s not a market where you can operate remotely.\u201d\n\nIn pursuing this plan, the startup has hired Damilola Aluede as managing director to head its Nigerian division.\n\nAccess to credit facilities provides businesses and individuals with numerous benefits. Businesses can scale and unlock demand using credit like M-KOPA and Daystar Power do. On the part of the customers, they can access products and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nHowever, getting credit is difficult for both individuals and businesses in Nigeria. According to Business Day, seven in ten bank customers in Nigeria lack access to credit. In the same vein, only 4% of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the country have access to credit. Therefore, providing a way for banks and lending institutions to assess creditworthiness will increase access.\n\nThe startup has also signed up a few customers in Nigeria, including Lendaba, Sycamore, Golden Ox Partners, Vola Africa, Venero, and Fundii. It also has a working arrangement with API fintech, Mono.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing technology to predict the creditworthiness of a customer is great in theory. However, doing this requires data that is notoriously hard to collect in Nigeria. Unsurprisingly, Collins points out that this is their biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cThe ability to get good data sources is a big challenge in Nigeria. A lot of our data partners have specific customers, so their customers are just a small group of customers compared to the whole. So the challenge now is for us to try and find different ways to get data or the ability to assess the creditworthiness of the large majority that are not involved in the economy.\u201d\n\nTo solve this problem, Collins discloses that Periculum will be making use of existing data such as the NIN and BVN for customers who are already involved in the economy. For those who are not, the plan is to draw on data from mobile transactions.\n\nBusiness model and key differentiator\n\nPericulum can make money in two major ways \u2014 a credit analytics and data analytics service to businesses. Consequently, the startup can charge its customers for API calls or a subscription fee.\n\nPericulum is not the only African startup trying to solve this problem. In addition to the lending startups mentioned above, there is also Toju and CARMA. However, Collins believes that their data analytics solution gives them the edge over their competitors.\n\n\u201cA lot of our competitors do one thing, maybe a couple of things, but we do multiple things. We don\u2019t just provide a credit scoring system; we do a lot of data analytics as well. In fact, our core business proposition is data analysis.\u201d\n\nAs the government and private sector work to improve the economy, increasing access to credit facilities for individuals and businesses will be key. However, challenges such as a lack of uniformity in data collection remain, and startups that can work around them could be successful while unlocking pathways to wealth for more Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "There\u2019s more to crypto than buying low and selling high",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin was at an all-time high (ATH) of $68,000; it was definitely a great time to be in crypto. At times like that, crypto traders and evangelists seize every opportunity to remind everyone who isn\u2019t into crypto trading what they are missing.\n\nHowever, it is a different story on the crypto streets as Bitcoin is bleeding out. The flagship crypto has lost almost half of what it gained during the ATH of 2021, and the charts remain crimson red.\n\nThe continuous nosedive has wiped out $1 trillion from the total market cap of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor those who are not new to the extreme volatility that comes with trading or hodling crypto, the current decline is just one of those things. For Ruth Iselema, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange, Bitmama, the current dip in crypto prices isn\u2019t so much of a bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselema revealed this at Techpoint Build 2021 while speaking on the topic, Crypto beyond trading. She touched on other use cases of cryptocurrencies besides trading and how they could be very important to finance in Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s more to crypto than trading\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily for speculative purposes, buying low and selling high, but they weren\u2019t originally created for speculation. According to the white paper by Bitcoin\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the essence of Bitcoin is to provide a \u201csystem for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nToday, Bitcoin trading is more or less a career path for some, an edge against inflation and the light at the end of the poverty tunnel. According to Iselema, cryptocurrencies are viewed this way, especially in Africa, because of the high poverty rate.\n\nAround 40% of Africa\u2019s population \u2014 1.3 billion \u2014 lives in extreme poverty, making crypto trading a very attractive venture. Iselema also pointed out that crypto trading is more popular among other use cases because of the complexities of using cryptocurrencies.\n\nBringing crypto into regular finance\n\nFrom lending, insurance, and exchange of value, cryptocurrencies have other use cases beyond trading. All these are classified under decentralised finance (DeFi), financial activities performed on decentralised networks.\n\nWhen it comes to alternative use of cryptocurrencies, DeFi paints a very vivid picture. It allows crypto to perform the same function as traditional financial institutions with fiat currencies, but, of course, without the need for those institutions.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThe goal of DeFi is to create a financial system without third parties. It does this through decentralised peer-to-peer networks. This means anyone without an Internet connection can lend, trade, and borrow without the usual documentation in centralised finance.\n\nThere are several DeFi protocols such as Compound that provide crypto lending and borrowing services. People who have crypto will make it available to those who want to borrow. Collateral can be provided in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other crypto assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart contracts are an essential part of DeFi as they ensure that every party holds up its end of the bargain. As opposed to lending apps that hassle borrowers after they default on payment, smart contracts immediately carry out the action that was agreed upon if the borrower defaults on payment.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also another interesting use case for crypto. From buying valuable art or music to creating one, NFTs have been a life-changer for Africans and many across the globe.\n\nThere\u2019s still a high barrier\n\nWhile these use cases seem simple enough on the surface, there is a high educational barrier to using them. According to blockchain research tool, Dune Analytics, there are 4 million unique DeFi addresses as of January 2022.\n\nIt is important to note that one person can have up to 10 addresses, and the actual users of DeFi protocols could be less than half of the number of existing addresses. This means that not even a fraction of the global population uses DeFi protocols.\n\nWhile Africa might be the home of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions, it\u2019s still behind in alternative crypto usage such as DeFi. In Statista\u2018s ranking of 20 countries with the most DeFi interactions, only one African country \u2014 Togo \u2014 made the list, ranking 20th.\n\nThis can be owed to the fact that many DeFi platforms are complicated and expensive to use. Blockchain expert Oluchi Enebeli believes that the blockchain space is still largely composed of engineers and developers who do not pay much attention to design and simplicity.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve been touted as the path to financial freedom, crypto usage can be very costly, thus creating a financial barrier. Transactions on the Ethereum network, the most popular network for alternative crypto usage, cost a lot. For context, transaction costs could be higher than the value of the transaction.\n\nWhile there are new networks, Solana and Polygon, for instance, springing up and reducing the cost of crypto usage, only time will tell if alternative crypto usage will catch on in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

The programme has been hailed as a workable, effective and sustainable template for basic education service delivery reform.\n\nFollowing the success of the programme in the state many States in Nigeria, including Lagos, have launched similar reform programmes mirroring EdoBEST while other countries have also visited the state to under study the programme.\n\nIn November 2021, the Executive Chairmen of all 37 State SUBEBs and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the management of the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) met in Benin City and an understudy of the EdoBEST programme resulted in glowing endorsements and unanimous calls for a nation-wide implementation of similar technology-backed education reforms.\n\nThe exit of former SUBEB Chairman Joan Osa-Oviawe and the entrance of a new Executive Chairman Edo SUBEB Mrs. Ozavize Salami has not stop more developmental gains of the programme as more grounds have been covered for the advancement of EdoBEST to the benefits of every Edo child.\n\nHolding up to the vision of Mr. Governor Mrs Salami created more platform for more teachers to undergo professional development as EdoBEST penetrates hard-to-reach areas in Edo State.\n\nThe SUBEB Chairman believed that the professional development for teachers in Edo State is necessary to boost the capacity of Edo State\u2019s teaching corps and further spread the gains of EdoBEST.\n\nDetermined to tread the path of developing, the EdoSUBEB has commenced the training of over 2,000 primary and secondary school teachers to further drive the gains of EdoBEST to the grassroots.\n\nAdditionally, 109 newly employed Learning and Development Officers and 26 Quality Assurance Officers are also being trained to strengthen the school supervisory system.\n\nThe professional development training, which is ongoing in Benin City the Edo State Capital is designed to provide qualified teachers and field officers for more communities in rural and hard-to-reach areas in Edo State.\n\nSalami said \u201cThis training will enable more of our esteemed pupils and students get the full benefits of EdoBEST as it brings junior secondary schools and more primary schools under the EdoBEST reform umbrella.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 In it\u2019s contribution to the Federal Government coffers in 2021, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) revealed that it paid N37.69 billion to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) last year.\n\nThe NIMASA Director-General Bashir Jamoh who disclosed this during a media chat in Lagos at weekend noted that the N37.69 contribution was higher than N31.83 billion contributed by the agency in 2020.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn 2020, the agency contributed to the consolidated revenue account by paying N31,839,917,978.20k. We went ahead to increase the amount we paid in 2021 with a total amount of N37,691,630, 450.22k.\u201d\n\nJamoh said NIMASA was striving to strengthen its security mechanism, while enhancing revenue collection process to the Federal Government.\n\nThe NIMASA DG also revealed that the N50bn floating dock being built would be operational before the end of the first quarter of 2022, noting that the facility would, however, be subjected to a privatisation process to help lessen the cost burden.\n\n\u201cWe expect before the end of the first quarter the floating dock to be operational. Our floating dock is owned by NIMASA and we handed it over to a public-private partnership. The issue of privatisation is not a product but a process\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe DG of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) was here to give us the first certificate, telling us that privatising the modular floating dock is profitable. We have gone ahead to do negotiations with the Managing Partner, the Nigerian Ports Authority. We expect that by the middle of February, we would get the final no-objection certificate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NIMASA DG stressed that the privatisation of the floating dock must be approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) because it was a national asset. He added that the agency suffered a lot of challenges when work began on it, but the cost could not be borne by the Federal Government alone.\n\n\u201cWhen it is privatised, the managing partners can decide and move it to the proper position it should be. Operationality of the floating dock would be taken over by foreigners to service it before the approval of the FEC. By the time we receive approval and the floating dock is in use, we will move it to where it belongs,\u201d he added.\n\nA floating dry dock is one of the five types of dry docks used for ship repairs. It is a submersible platform that is specifically designed and used to repair vessels.\n\nThe multi-million dollar modular floating dock acquired by NIMASA since June 11, 2018, has been lying idle in Lagos, with the cost of maintenance estimated at about $30,000 daily.\n\nThe floating dock, which was conceptualised and acquired by the Dakuku Peterside-led administration, was expected to serve as a maintenance base for visiting vessels and those domiciled in the country, with the intention to save about $100 million yearly in capital flight, generate employment and boost local capacity.\n\nSpeaking on the involvement of the European Union in the safeguarding of the Gulf of Guinea, Jamoh said the agency had to make the collaboration since Nigeria\u2019s integrity was at stake.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cWhatever happens in the Gulf of Guinea affects Nigeria. Our integrity is strained and nobody respects us. Sometimes, they see us as part of the criminals. We took it upon ourselves to have a meeting called the Joint Industry Working Group. It was from this we got the shared Gulf of Guinea where international communities contributed to lessening insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit down and watch Nigerians being accused anyhow. That\u2019s how the European Union came to the Gulf of Guinea. They consist of Denmark, France, Italy, Britain, United States (US) and even the Danish. The Gulf of Guinea is large and we allowed them in. In a bid to address this issue, we experienced the issue with the Danish Frigate. That\u2019s why the issue was there,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile noting that there were lots of errors on the rules of engagement of the foreign navies in the Gulf of Guinea, he disclosed that the frigate, which was deployed off West Africa in October, intervened in an alleged attack on a commercial vessel in November, killing four pirates and taking four other suspects on board the frigate, according to Reuters. Three of them suspected to be Nigerians were freed by the authorities in the country.\n\nThe fourth, who was injured and had his leg amputated, appeared in court in Copenhagen, where he was charged with the attempted manslaughter of Danish soldiers. He could not be released due to his condition, though he pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge.\n\nHe disclosed that wreck removal had reached an advanced stage from Badagry to Tin Can Island.\n\n...",

          "text": "Africa is on the spotlight once again with the resurgence of military takeovers of democratic governments sweeping across the continent with the concomitant negative implications for the beleaguered continent and its hapless citizens.\n\nFrom 2019, it is either one successful coup or coup attempt across the continent as the soldiers seem to have abandoned their professional call to usurp power. Regional organisations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union (AU) appear to be bewildered and lacking coordinated measures to forestall the scourge of coups.\n\nThe latest in the gale of coups was Burkina Faso, the land of the famed Thomas Sankara. Last Monday, January 24, 2022, 41-year-old Paul- Henry Damiba rallied his troops to topple the democratic government of Marc Christian Kabore and took charge of the country.\n\nThere was a deluge of reasons offered by the soldiers who removed Kabore ranging from his alleged incompetence in handling the menace of armed groups killing the citizens of Burkina Faso, to poor economic atmosphere leading to massive suffering.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nECOWAS has suspended Burkina Faso from its institutions but the coup leaders are not bordered about that.\n\nDespite the spirited condemnation and sanctions by international community, the soldiers have refused to budge and in some cases initiated a transition programme that is headed nowhere.\n\nThis ugly trend became very pronounced last year 2021across Africa. On September 5, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya led a group of soldiers to overthrow the democratic government of President Alpha Conde in Guinea. The deposed Conde may have provided the leeway for the junta when he manipulated his country\u2019s constitution to force himself on his people for tenure elongation after he had served out his constitutionally required two terms of office. However, democracy pundits believe that on no situation should the military take power because of the massive disruptions in the development process that it engenders.\n\nDoumbouya had accused the 83-year-old Conde of high-handedness and incompetence in the face of glaring economic hardship facing ordinary citizens. ECOWAS and other regional organisations have since imposed suspension on Guinea but the coup leaders have remained unperturbed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Sudan following the uneasy power sharing arrangement between a civilian government and the military, army General Abdel Fattah al-Burnhan, on 25 October 2021, removed the civilian government, citing political infighting.\n\nThe coup leaders dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders including the Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and declared a state of emergency. Waves of protests have since hit the country with pro-democracy groups, despite massive crackdown by soldiers, vehemently demanding a democratic transition process that is devoid of the trappings of the army.\n\nRecall that this is the second coup in Sudan after the military shoved aside the government of long-serving dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 following huge protests.\n\nHowever, the coup leaders buckled under intense pressure and reinstated Mr. Hamdok in order to appease pro -democracy groups who have refused to allow the army to have its way. Hamdok has since resigned leaving the situation tense.\n\nIn May 2021, Colonel Assimi Goita carried out a second coup in nine months in Mali. He overthrew the transition President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane accusing them of sidelining the army in a cabinet appointment.\n\nIncidentally Goita had in August 2020, removed the democratically elected government of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita after mass protests against Keita\u2019s government. Despite condemnation by the international community, Goita has remained unyielding. He has elicited severe sanctions on his country by the ECOWAS which banned flights and taken other stringent measures to force him to stick to the initial election timetable scheduled for February, which he has jettisoned and demanding for five more years in power.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Chad, long-serving despot, President Idris Deby, was killed on Tuesday April 20 2021, in a battle with a rebel group -the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT). But instead of his death to usher in a new democratic dispensation, soldiers loyal to the Deby dynasty quickly imposed his 37-year-old son, Mahamat, as successor in blatant violation of the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nChad\u2019s constitution stipulates that the head of the country\u2019s parliament should assume power in the event of the death of the President within a time frame in which elections are to hold.\n\nAlthough Chadian military leaders have initiated an 18- month transition period to conduct elections, the transitional process is headed to a certain outcome- which is to entrench Idris Deby dynasty that started in 1990, now represented by his son.\n\nApart from the aforementioned countries, there was an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ethiopia in 2019. Also between 2020 and 2021 Central African Republic had its fair share of coup attempts and there seem to be no end in sight to this bugbear.\n\nExperts feared that the succession of coups can only lead to destabilization of the continent and worsening the already bad situation because the military do not always have what it takes to direct things towards positive change.\n\nThe implication is that military coups and coup attempts are becoming a regular occurrence in Africa in the decades since independence and this poses a great danger to democratic development.\n\nInternational constitutional law expert, Livingstone Wechie told LEADERSHIP Sunday that the root causes of Coups in Africa in recent years are largely hinged on greed and \u201cpower absolutism.\u201d\n\nHe said the implication is that a programme aimed at sustaining instability in Africa has been mapped out because of the besetting impacts coups have on the state.\n\nHe added that coups lead to \u201cthe reversal of government programmes that are already in place, beacsue a new system that totally negates development is put in place by decrees. It turns the state several years backwards and the ripple effect is that when more states are subjected to this type of situation it eventually spirals across Africa which end we never get to see.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, none of the reasons for the coups are based on a genuine concern for good governance and democracy. The bait of corruption and malgovernance remains a smokescreen used to mislead the people so the coup leaders can continue to perpetrate themselves in power for ulterior motives.\n\n\u201cThe absence of genuine patriotism is a clear indication of high appetite for unbridled power,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, public affairs analyst, Austin Onuoha, said the coups have become constant because democracy has failed to deliver its dividends to the people of Africa and so coup leaders are trying other models of government.\n\nHe said \u201cIf democracy has delivered may be we won\u2019t be where we are today. I think is a vote of no confidence on democracy. There is nothing wrong with democracy but the way we have practiced it. Democracy addresses three challenges; one is leadership challenge, which deals with who we recruit as leaders and how we remove them if they failed.\n\n\u201cThe second challenge that democracy addresses is the issue of development, clearly mapping out what our development priorities are because in every nation there are so many things to be done. And the final challenge that democracy should address is governance. So, if democracy cannot address the challenge of leadership, development and governance, then there is likely to be coup.\u201d",

          "text": "The Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Aloy Ejimakor, has stated that the Abuja Federal High Court may reinstate Kanu\u2019s initial bail.\n\nAccording to Ejimakor, the Abia State High Court\u2019s decision may pave the road for Kanu\u2019s bail to be reinstated by the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nIn 2017, the IPOB leader was granted bail by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nSoldiers raided his Afaraukwu home in Abia State shortly after he was given bail.\n\nIn the midst of the invasion, the IPOB leader fled to Europe, where he continued to campaign for Biafra.\n\nKanu was apprehended and repatriated in June 2021 in an African country thought to be Kenya.\n\nKanu filed a fundamental rights infringement complaint against the Nigerian government through Ejimakor in October 2021.\n\nIn his decision, Justice Anya termed Kanu\u2019s detention in Kenya as unconstitutional and ordered the Federal Government to compensate him with one billion naira.\n\nThe government must also apologize to Kanu, according to the ruling.\n\nEjimakor, on the other hand, said the decision was significant and will have a direct bearing on Kanu\u2019s appeal in the Federal High Court.\n\nIn a statement he signed, Ejimakor said: \u201cThis press release is necessitated by the flurry of public commentaries on the 19th January 2022 judgment of the High Court of Abia State in favor of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cMost of the commentaries have bordered on examining the latent impacts the judgment may have beyond the monetary award and the apology. Of particular note is whether the judgment should directly or indirectly impact the persisting notion that Kanu had jumped bail in 2017, which was what grounded the bench warrant that was used to justify his rendition.\n\n\u201cIn summary, the answer is in the affirmative that this landmark judgment has created new legal opportunities for Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, especially as regards impeaching the bench warrant that grandfathered his extraordinary rendition.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that from late 2017, I had maintained a well-publicized stance that Nnamdi Kanu never jumped bail and that he will, in due course of time, prove that it was the Nigerian government that compelled him to flee and seek refuge outside Nigeria. This was the material issue before the Court and it prevailed.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the Court held that: \u201cIt is the view of this Court that the Army set out as pythons to terminate the life of Nnamdi Kanu. The military invasion of his home at Afaraukwu Ibeku is so notorious that this Court cannot turn a blind eye to it. He deserves an apology and compensation.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the Court held that: \u201cKanu has by credible evidence proved to the Honourable Court that his fundamental rights to dignity of human person and personal liberty were wantonly or brazenly violated and his fundamental right to life threatened brazenly by Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Court impliedly held that Kanu never made a voluntary decision to flee Nigeria or to be absent from his trial. To this extent, this judgment has finally obliterated the vested and false notion that Kanu had jumped bail back in 2017.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the bench warrant upon which his rendition from Kenya was grounded has now become impeachable and liable to be vacated, thus paving the way for his previous bail to be reinstated.\u201d",

          "text": "Babangida Aliyu, former governor of Niger State, has said some Northerners made it impossible for former President Goodluck Jonathan to defeat Boko Haram.\n\nAccording to PUNCH, the former governor said it was unfortunate that insecurity had been allowed to escalate.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen Boko Haram started and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government started doing something about it, it fell on former President Jonathan to carry on. Many Northerners misconstrued his (Jonathan) position at that time and for political purposes, they threw many arguments that made it impossible for the proper articulation and proper implementation of policies that would have got rid of Boko Haram and now, we still have them till today.\n\n\u201cThe banditry that many of us thought was impossible to happen, I am yet to hear from anybody about the statement credited to Kawu Baraje, our former PDP national chairman in Kwara State, when he stated that they brought the bandits or Fulani from other places. I think based on the thinking that probably former President Jonathan wouldn\u2019t have handed over power even if they had won, but he handed over.\n\n\u201cHe congratulated them even before the conclusion proper counting of votes which then took away whatever purposes of bringing those people would have served and I would have thought that if that is true, then those who brought them in would compensated them to go back to where they came from.\n\n\u201cIf the governors had really done a lot from 2015 to date, we would have got rid of the banditry.\n\n\u201dToday it\u2019s so unfortunate that you probably have to be praying when you leave Abuja for Kaduna or Kaduna to Abuja or indeed, particularly in the Northern states.\n\n\u201cNow, even in the day time, you can\u2019t drive freely and comfortably. So, I believe that the first port of call for fighting insecurity is the governors. Maybe you heard me in Kano when I was saying could one be greater than 19 because at one time, even though the circumstances were different, we had one man for 19 states and now, we have 19 governors and still, we have more problems than we did the last time.\u201d",

          "text": "Gunmen Sunday morning attacked Atak Mawai in Zaman Dabo Village and Kurmin Masara in Atyap Chiefdom, Zangon Kataf local government area of Kaduna state, killing 13 people, including a pre-teen boy.\n\nBut the state government confirmed 11 residents killed, and some inflicted with gunshot injuries.\n\nSeveral people were injured in the attack just as 40 houses were razed by the gunmen.\n\nChairman, Zangon Kataf local government area, Hon. Francis Angwa Sani confirmed the attacks, but declined comment on the number of casualties and houses burnt, saying he was yet to receive the report.\n\n\u201cYes, there was attack, but I don\u2019t have complete details. I learnt people were killed and houses burnt but I\u2019ve not gotten the report yet,\u201d Sani said.\n\nHowever, a source, who preferred anonymity, said a young boy between five and 10 years and two women, were among the 13 people killed, adding that the gunmen came around 3:00am and started shooting sporadically killing anybody at sight.\n\n\u201cI was at home sleeping when I heard gunshots at 2:58am. I found somewhere to hide for safety. I learnt that the soldiers in charge of Zonkwa were called immediately but they didn\u2019t come.\n\n\u201cAround 3:45am, the commandant was called again that the situation is worse, then, he switched off his phone.\n\n\u201cThe attacks happened in Kurmin Masara and Zaman Dabo, this morning we went to the place and discovered 13 corpses.\n\n\u201cThere was a young boy of between five and 10 years who was shot in the leg and later died, two women were also killed in the attack. They burnt down almost 40 houses in the two villages.\n\n\u201cWhen the soldiers came early this morning, they said they were pinned down by some gunmen, that the gunmen blocked the road,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Kaduna state command, ASP Muhammad Jalige said he would confirm and get back to journalists.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t get back as at the time of this report.\n\nThe source further said apart from the houses burnt, the villagers\u2019 foodstuffs and other valuables belonging to residents of the communities, were also destroyed.\n\nBut in a statement, the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan said: \u201cSecurity forces have reported to the Kaduna state government that Kurmin Masara general area of Zangon Kataf LGA was attacked in the early hours of today.\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, troops of the Nigerian Air Force Special Forces who responded to distress calls from the area also fell into an ambush as they mobilized to the scene of the attack. The troops cleared the ambush and reached the general area, along with troops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH).\n\n\u201cAs of 4:30pm, eleven residents were confirmed killed, and some inflicted with gunshot injuries.\n\n\u201cThe victims confirmed killed are listed as follows: Elizabeth Ayuba, Veronica Auta, Bege Daniel, Kephas Waje, Promise Jacob, Damaris Istifanus, Hauwa Joshua, Dogara Gambo, Lidia Ishaya, Michael Achi, Gabriel Michael.\n\n\u201cOver thirty houses and properties were burnt in the attack. The injured were evacuated for treatment. Search-and-rescue operations and pursuit of the attackers are in progress on different fronts.\n\n\u201cThe government of Kaduna state will make public further details as soon as they are received from security forces.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i, who has been in touch with the security forces and is receiving hourly briefings, expressed sadness at this report of the latest in a series of attacks in the area. He prayed for the repose of all those killed and conveyed his condolences to their families. He further wished the injured a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\n12 killed in Niger\n\nIn a related development, bandits carried out fresh attack on Galadima community of Shiroro local government of Niger state killing no fewer than 12 people.\n\nIn the incident that occurred weekend, sources said many other people were injured in the attack with several others still missing.\n\nCoordinator of Concerned Shiroro Youths Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki confirmed the attack Sunday in Minna, adding that it took place in broad day.\n\nHe said: \u201cPreliminary findings indicate that, about twelve (12) people were gruesomely massacred, many more injured through multiple gunshots and yet to be ascertained numbers of people are still missing.\u201d\n\nKokki said the bandits took advantage of the withdrawal of military personnel from the community to launch the attack.\n\nHe said, \u201cHitherto yesterday\u2019s broad daylight attack, Galadima Kogo was relatively peaceful and secured due to the presence of security personnel stationed in the town. Yesterday\u2019s tragedy that recorded wanton killings among other casualties could have been avoided if those security personnel had not been withdrawn previously.\u201d\n\nIn view of the calamity at hand, the youth called with the loudest voice on the authorities concerned to restore the withdrawn security personnel to Galadima Kogo area of the state.\n\nThey also called for the deployment of additional security personnel to other areas prone to insecurity with immediate effect.\n\nEfforts to get reaction from the Police was not successful as the PPRO, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be contacted.",

          "text": "The Presidency Sunday described as disgraceful and shameful the statement credited to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over its alleged attack on President Muhammadu Buhari for the cancellation of his visit to Zamfara state due to bad weather.\n\nPresident Buhari had scheduled to visit Zamfara state after commissioning BUA Cement Plant in Sokoto Thursday.\n\nHowever, owing to bad weather in the state, the president could not proceed.\n\nConsequently, President Buhari sent a video broadcast to the government and people of Zamfara state where he regretted his inability to come to the state as scheduled due to poor weather conditions and assured that he would reschedule the visit when visibility on air improves.\n\nThe cancellation of the visit attracted condemnation from the PDP, the country\u2019s leading opposition political party which had contended that Buhari should have travelled to Zamfara from Sokoto by road if he was concerned over the plight of the people.\n\nHowever, the PDP\u2019s statement attracted the ire of the presidency.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cElaboration of the reason the Presidential visit to Gusau was postponed\u201d and signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, the Presidency expressed sadness that the \u201cbankruptcy of issues\u201d have forced the PDP \u201cto hang on to life by only telling lies.\u201d\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe Presidency wishes to give further clarification on the circumstances of bad weather which forced the cancellation of the visit to Zamfara State on Thursday of President Muhammadu Buhari in spite of the great interest generated nationwide on the planned visit.\n\n\u201cAs briefly explained by the President in a special broadcast to the people of the state, the sudden deterioration of the weather was the sole and only reason for the cancellation of the visit.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for flights to get cancelled when there is bad weather, whether this is arising from wind or rainstorm, fog or haze as we had it on Thursday over much of the northern towns including Gusau, capital of Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cMany of these cities are known to suffer from low visibility during the harmattan season as we are now in.\n\n\u201cA kilometre of visibility is usually a standard landing minimum requirement but in the case of Gusau on the day in question, this minimum requirement of 1,000 meters was down, fluctuating between 300-400 meters. Clearly, this was unsafe in the absence of precise instrument approaches that provide guidance for the pilots. The flights into Gusau were, in view of this, cancelled.\u201d\n\nIt further said: \u201cCriticism of the President, in particular the one by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for not proceeding with the journey, Sokoto-Gusau by road, a distance of about 200 kilometres shows, either a lack of understanding of presidential movements especially for a party that held that office for sixteen years, or an act that smacks of mischief. Whatever be the case, there must be a limit to trivialisation.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, Commanders-in-Chief, serving or even those that have left office cannot hop into a car and go anywhere they want, at any time of the day. In the United States, for instance, a law going as far back as 1958 prevents past Presidents from travelling on public roads without assured security (how much more of serving Presidents).\n\n\u201cWhen roads are closed for presidential movements here and elsewhere, consideration is also given to the safety of other road users, not just that of the President or even governor.\n\n\u201cThe statement on the issue by the PDP attacking the President for not making it to Gusau without this being planned ahead of the journey is shameful and disgraceful for a party that held the presidency of the country in the past. What is their own record?\n\n\u201cIt is sad for the country that the bankruptcy of issues has forced the PDP, so-called leading opposition party, to hang on to life by only telling lies. And their caravan of falsehood has moved even more speedily following the inauguration of their not-so-new national executive at the end of last year.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important that local political actors who have seized upon the cancellation of the visit to describe it as a victory for this or that faction of the party, accompanied by songs, lyrics and videos to know that their joy is a short-lived one. As he promised in that broadcast, the visit to Gusau by the President is only a matter of time.\n\n\u201cGiven the right conditions of the weather and all other things, he will return, and in time to accomplish his mission.\u201d",
