          "text": "ABUJA\u2014LEADERS of the 3rd Force Movement under the auspices of the National Consultative Front, NCFront, yesterday, urged the Federal Government to take urgent steps to immediately find lasting panacea in resolving the issues associated with the ongoing Universities Workers\u2019 (ASUU, SSANU, NASU and NAAT) strikes which commenced with an ASUU warning strike in February 2022.\n\nIn a statement by its Head of Public Affairs Bureau, Dr Tanko Yunusa stated: \u201cWe make this call in the overriding interest of our nation, but more particularly for the huge number of students, parents, academic and non- teaching staff in all federal and state-owned universities across the country who have been affected directly by this avoidable strike.\n\n\u201cOur youths in public universities are losing their most active and creative years due to no fault of theirs, while their parents are undergoing a painful agony of witnessing their children and resources waste away under their very noses. Sadly, the children of most top government officials attend private universities or study abroad; they do not feel the distress and torment of the ordinary parents which we continue to call for a law mandating state actors their nuclear families to attend only Nigerian institutions while in office. In addition, the government is also wasting our national resources because by the end of the strike, all academic staff and non-teaching staff that are mostly inactive now would still receive their salaries.\n\n\u201cThe bedrock of modern nation building is education and any country that trivializes it, is clearly on a path to failure. It is, therefore, regrettable that the Federal Government continues to be aloof to its responsibilities by undermining the issues associated with Collective Agreements with the University based unions which has become a vicious cycle for decades. These concerns are not insurmountable; however, it requires a symbiotic relationship between Government and all critical stakeholders in the education sector to resolve them amicably.\n\n\u201cLet us begin by isolating indisputable facts that are trite. The unions have an avalanche of genuine demands; and these demands are increasing from year to year due to Government\u2019s reneging or failing to address the issues in a timely manner. There have been recent meetings or dialogue sessions between Government, led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, and the unions which ended in deadlocks, probably due to past experiences of Government failure to honour agreements reached.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the issues concerning the public universities can be resolved, if government comes to the table with sincerity of purpose by recognizing the problems and show willingness to fix them. It is known to all concerned that the main concerns of the unions since the 1980s are no more than the inadequate funding of the university system, decaying and overstretched infrastructural facilities, conditions of service (salary and non-salary), autonomy and academic freedom, brain drain, and the survival of the university system. The current spate of strikes also revolves around some of these same issues and governments\u2019 failure to honour previous Collective Agreements. And for how long would our nation continue to suffer from the pains of such insincerity and incapacity?\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the 3rd Force Mega Movement, under the auspices of NCFront therefore pleads with all key stakeholders that are relevant to the resolution of the ongoing strike action to reconsider and prioritize the pains and agony of our youths and parents affected by this unfortunate situation and make every effort to resolve this impasse as quickly as possible so that our students can return to their educational and life pursuits.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the Education Confab as proposed would come up with critical resolutions that should alter current policies and laws in a way that would prevent University based Unions\u2019 strikes in the foreseeable future. Our dream is to build a nation in which every citizen shall be free and educated, healthy and prosperous.\u201d",

If you meet SMEP today, they will tell you the state government has budgeted millions to procure and distribute malaria drugs and other commodities.\n\n\u201cWe have been hearing this since 2019 but we have not seen these drugs and other commodities being procured as we were been told year in year out\u201d, he decried.\n\nHe then called on the responsible health authority in the state to increase funding for malaria activities beyond mere budgeting without releases and cashback to implement malaria programmes.\n\n\u201cWe want to see concerted efforts put in place by the state government to punish the offenders and one way to do that is to be tracking the batch identity number of supplied malaria commodities so we can track them to patient stores to check diversion. This is a part of the recommendations the partners have given. But as partners, we can only recommend, we don\u2019t have the powers to enforce.\n\n\u201cOn our part as civil society, it is our responsibility to demand accountability for malaria commodities.

          "text": "\n\n*Buhari mourns over 100 persons killed in Imo explosion, says it\u2019s national disaster *Insists those responsible must be brought to justice *Directs security agencies to clamp down on oil theft\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIIn furtherance of Operation Dakatar Da Barawo (OPDDB) that was launched to checkmate crude oil theft and related acts of economic sabotage, the Nigerian Navy said it seized 6, 000, 000 litres of stolen crude oil estimated at N264 billion.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed \u201cshock and trauma\u201d about the death of over 100 people in an explosion at an illegal oil refinery in Imo State.\n\nHowever, there were no report of seized barges and motherships by the Navy, unfortunately, that is where most of the theft occur because these are the means by which stolen crude oil are being transported to international market and sold at far below the market price. And sadly this is occurring right under the nose of the security agencies some of who the government has acknowledged collude with the the criminals to shortchange the country.\n\nFollowing the alarming increase of crude oil theft, the president had directed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, to ensure that the criminal activity was brought to a halt. Buhari\u2019s directive had followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOwing to the directive, the naval troops disclosed that they recorded more arrests and seizures between April 15th and 23rd, 2022, being the third week of the operation.\n\nA statement issued by Naval Headquarters stated that the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) DELTA in Warri, deactivated an Illegal Refining Site (IRS) around Sara creek.\n\nThe IRS had 16 ovens, 16 metal storage tanks and three wide pits filled with about 500,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, as well as 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil, a generator and 4 pumping machines.\n\nAlso, the statement revealed that an IRS at Asugbo creek in Warri was discovered with six ovens, 12 metal storage tanks and five large pits all containing about 600,000 litres of stolen crude oil including 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 150,000 litres of sludge.\n\nSimilarly, sequel to series of air reconnaissance, Forward Operating Base (FOB) FORMOSO in Bayelsa State on April 19, 2022, raided an IRS at Ereweibio creek in Brass LGA.\n\nAccordingly, seven large cooking ovens, 10 large metal storage tanks and drums all laden with about 400,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and 20,000 litres of suspected illegally refined PMS were discovered.\n\nThe site also had five large pits holding approximately 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil. Equally, two pumping machines, one gasoline generator, one submersible pump and one chainsaw machine were discovered at the site and destroyed in situ.\n\nAccording to the statement, on April 21, 2022, an IRS at Lelemu creek in Warri South-West was discovered. During the operation, 19 ovens, 26 metal storage tanks and two dugout pits laden with about 250,000 litres of suspected stolen crude oil and 50,000 litres of illegally refined AGO were destroyed.\n\nTo ensure effective deactivation of IRS, NNS DELTA on 21 April 2022 conducted swamp buggy operations during which an earlier identified IRS around Egwa creek in Warri was destroyed.\n\nDuring the operation, 16 ovens, 31 metal storage tanks and seven large pits all filled with about 850,000 litres of stolen crude oil were equally deactivated.\n\nRelatedly, on 22 April 2022, around Lelemu creek in Warri South West LGA of Delta State, personnel under NNS DELTA again discovered 22 IRS ovens, 12 metallic storage tanks and 5 large pits all containing about 150,000 litres of stolen crude oil.\n\n\u201cAt another IRS off Lelemu creek, 19 ovens, 42 storage tanks and 14 large pits containing about 300,000 litres of stolen crude oil, as well as approximately 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, 100,000 litres of illegally refined DPK and 100,000 litres of suspected crude oil sludge were all destroyed,\u201d it added.\n\nIn a related development, NNS LUGARD at Kogi State in the course of OPDDB discovered an IRS on 22 April 2022, at a location off Akili-Ozizor community of Ogbaru LGA, Anambra State.\n\nDuring the operation, four locally fabricated ovens, seven metal storage tanks, four large pits of which two were for storage of about 48,000 litres of stolen crude oil were all destroyed.\n\nOn the same day, NNS VICTORY in Calabar raided tanker garage along Harbour road in the city and seized a storage tank containing about 45,000 Litres of suspected illegally refined AGO. Also, a tanker laden with 33,000 Litres of suspected locally refined AGO was seized and the owner was arrested. Furthermore, about 58 drums of locally refined AGO were also seized.\n\nAdditionally, NNS SOROH at Yenagoa, on Saturday 23 April 2022 intercepted a wooden boat at Otuokpot Area along Kolo creek.\n\n\u201cThe wooden boat was laden with 60,000Litres of illegally refined AGO together with over 100 sacks of same product. Items on the boat which included one pumping machine, one Yamaha 40HP outboard engine and one locally made boat Anchor with the products were destroyed at Ogbia waterside,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe base also conducted a search on a Market Boat heading for St Nicolas Axis from Akassa area.\n\nAbout 2,500 litres of suspected illegally refined products stored in gallons and sacks were hidden inside the boat. Accordingly, same were evacuated for destruction. Likewise on the same day, personnel under NNS DELTA on patrol around Jones creek in Warri South West LGA raided an IRS and discovered 33 ovens, 42 metal storage tanks and seven wide pits all filled with about 1,200,000 litres of stolen crude oil, 250,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 100,000 litres of sludge.\n\nFurthermore, combing of the area off Jones creek led to the discovery of another IRS with five ovens, two metal storage tanks and eight large pits with about 150,000 litres of sludge. Both IRS off Jones creek with the discovered items and products were destroyed in situ.\n\nThe statement affirmed that over 6,000,000 litres of products valued over N3 billion from oil thieves and economic saboteurs.\n\n\u201cThe migration by operators of IRS from the South South geopolitical zone to the South East also come to the fore. \u201cThis development will in no way deter the Nigerian Navy from ensuring zero tolerance for COT, IRS, illegal bunkering and related economic crimes in the Nation\u2019s maritime environment and adjoining territory\u201d, it said.\n\nBuhari Mourns Over 100 Persons Killed in Imo Illegal Refinery Explosion, Says It\u2019s National Disaster\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Mr. Garba Shehu, Buhari, who described the unfortunate incident that occurred in Ohaji/Egbema of Imo State as a, \u201ccatastrophe and a national disaster,\u201d called on the security agencies to intensify their clampdown on oil theft.\n\nMany people were reportedly burnt beyond recognition by the explosion. It was learnt that the police were now looking for the owner of the unlawful refinery.\n\nDozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire.\n\nThe death toll continued to rise as emergency workers went through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) told the British media organisation, BBC Igbo, that the number killed now stood at 109.\n\n\u201cWe learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\u201d Nnaji said.\n\nWhile offering his condolences to the families of the victims, the president demanded that those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice.\n\nIn the statement, titled, \u201cImo \u2018Refinery\u2019 Deaths, a National Disaster,\u201d Buhari urged community leaders and the security personnel in the area to prevent a reoccurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed the nation\u2019s armed forces, security and intelligence agencies to intensify the clampdown on illegal refineries following the reported deaths of tens of people Friday night after an illegal refinery exploded at Abaezi forest in the Ohaji-Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cReacting to what he described as a catastrophe and a national disaster, Buhari said responsibility for the loss of lives and property must squarely lie with the sponsors of the illegal refinery, who must all be caught and made to face justice.\n\n\u201cIn conveying the condolences and the full depth and range of the nation\u2019s shock and trauma to the families of the victims, the Ohaji/Egbema community and the government and people of Imo State, the president urged community leaders, the police, and the secret service to never allow the occurrence of the heart-breaking incident in any part of the country again.\u201d\n\nThe damage to fishing and farming in oil-rich communities caused by the oil industry over the decades has led some to find other ways to make money from the oil business. Illegal refining is attractive in some oil-producing communities, as it is seen as somewhat easy to manage, despite efforts to halt the practice.\n\nThe authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened overnight into Saturday, but accidents like this have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.\n\nThere have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria\u2019s official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country, and making the unlawful business very lucrative.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Tambuwal: Tell us who the elders are, \u2026we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible\n\n*Saraki: It\u2019s a welcome development, painstaking efforts\n\n*Mohammed commends IBB, says recommendation not an imposition\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauch\n\nThe ripples generated by the consensus report of some northern elders, which endorsed former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and the Bauchi State governor as the preferred Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) northern presidential candidates, assumed another dimension yesterday after the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), umbrella body for the northern establishment, dissociated itself from the initiative with an effort to correct certain misgivings.\n\nThis is as some of those concerned have also continued to state their own accounts of what happened, while the others, defended and justified the report, authored by Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nWhile, the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who had maintained a rebellious stance since inception, queried who the northern elders commissioned General Ibrahim Babangida were, Saraki, on his part, commended the report, stating it was a thorough and painstaking efforts that ought to be commended by all.\n\nMohammed too commended the former military president and explained that the report was not an imposition.\n\nOn the contrary, a group known as the United Arewa Youth For Justice and Development, has thrown its weight behind the decision of the northern elders over the endorsement of Mohammed and Saraki as northern presidential consensus candidates of the PDP ahead of the 2023, presidential primaries of the party.\n\nHowever, NEF, in a statement by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the forum was not involved in the process as a body, it further insisted it was not affiliated to any political party or aspirant as it were, adding that the idea to engineer a consensus among the aspirants was that of the aspirants themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make clear that the entire process did not involve the Northern Elders Forum as a group, and is not a product of the group. It has become necessary to address the impression created in part by mischief, and in part by genuine confusion over the role of the Convener of Northern Elders Forum, in the efforts to create consensus among four aspirants for the Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\n\u201cNorthern Elders Forum is not affiliated to any political party or aspirant, and is strongly committed to the creation of a level playing field, which will allow the emergence of the best leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe forum stated that, it has also remained consistent in its conviction that all parts of the country should play their parts freely, unhindered by restrictions, which offend principles of inclusion and fairness, adding that, the North has excellent candidates whose fate should be left to party delegates and voters to decide.\n\nIt further maintained that it remained united behind the protection and projection of interests of the North and Nigeria, and would play its role as it has always done whenever the circumstances demanded.\n\nTambuwal, speaking with newsmen, queried the report saying, \u201cTell us who are the elders that sat down to come up with that decision? Who are the people that gave advice to reach that conclusion? Nobody has this information.\n\n\u201cI consulted the party leadership across the country especially, the Northern PDP leaders but no one is aware what\u2019s going on, indicating that something fishy is going on. If not, we are the ones that took ourselves to them to help the process, and later withdrew, why should anyone insist the process of consensus must continue?\n\n\u201cSo, based on this, I didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in anyway reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters. I am not involved in any of such. I am still in the race, I am seeking victory from GOD and in his mercy, God will give me,\u201d he stated.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWe discussed the possibility of agreeing on one candidate within our group to represent us (Initially not even to represent the whole North) and we all agreed based on the situation of the party.\n\n\u201cWe started consultations based on that, and the fourth person that joined us is also another presidential aspirant Mohammad Hayatou-deen. In order for people not to perceive that may be we are trying to fight the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, we also went to consult him and seek his blessings.\n\n\u201cHe was happy about it but he didn\u2019t show any interest to join us. That was how we continued our consultations. Along the line, we discussed that we really need an elder in the country, who will help us reach our goal amicably in case we may encounter any disagreement along the line within ourselves and we all agreed that we should take the matter to former president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida in Minna.\n\n\u201cWe explained to him and he immediately agreed. He was very happy. And he promised to do his best to help us achieve our mission. However, we had to at a point tell ourselves the truth. The four of us met in Bauchi State government diplomatic House in Abuja on Wednesday, we looked into the issue from all angles and we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible and we cannot continue the process, everyone should embark on independent struggle, and whosoever GOD gives the ticket to, its ok.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that senator Bukola Saraki will organise a press conference and inform the public about the outcome. Without consulting us, Bukola Saraki on his own sent us message that we need to go to Minna and see Babangida after all that wasn\u2019t part of what we agreed upon in our meeting. I communicated with Governor of Bauchi Bala Mohammed whether he received same message which he did.\n\n\u201cWe went and met Bukola Saraki. But at that point, I made it categorically clear to them that for the sake of GOD, that we didn\u2019t agree on that; our agreement was that consensus candidate isn\u2019t possible, why should we go and suffer that old man again?\n\n\u201cAnd that I will not go to Minna. Why should they be in a hurry. It isn\u2019t something urgent. Reconciliation and consensus arrangement can be achieved even lately on the elections ground on the day of election. Why the hurry? Our initial plan was to expand our consultations and make the consensus candidate even at national level before we realised that it isn\u2019t possible, even in our group let alone be at national level.\n\n\u201cBut they insisted we have to go to Minna and discuss the issue with Babangida. They were so in a hurry. And to our surprise, the consensus they agreed on yielded two candidates, the two of them not even one. That\u2019s an indication something fishy is going on, and I understand that already. Go and ask the three of them. We met on Wednesday and we agreed to bury the issue of consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cHow come Babangida and the Northern elders he invited would impose it on us after all we took ourselves to him, and we later withdrew,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut Saraki, through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyanu, described the report of the consensus as thorough and painstaking in reaching the decision.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cIt is a welcome development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent. One needs to commend and appreciate the elders, who worked to actualise the process.\n\n\u201cMay Allah bless them all. Their decision was based on equity, justice, and need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process, which can help the party later on. The process is a work-in-progress.\n\n\u201cOne person will still emerge from the on-going process here in the North. The South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East.\n\n\u201cA nation like Nigeria with all the current problems needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nMohammed, in a statement by his campaign spokesperson, Prof Udenta Udenta, said, \u201cOn Wednesday 20th April, 2022 Gen. Ibrahim Babangida GCFR, through the channel of the platform he inaugurated, announced Senator Bala Mohammed and Senator Bukola Saraki as the selected Consensus Aspirants.\n\n\u201cThe Senator Bala Mohammed Presidential Campaign Organisation will thus like to place on record its eternal gratitude to President Ibrahim Babangida, GCFR and the entirety of Northern Elders, who assisted him in reaching this decision.\n\n\u201cOur deep appreciation to them stems less from the fact that Senator Mohammed is among the two selected consensus aspirants and more on their Labour of thankless patriotic duty and uncommon leadership in attempting to bring order and coherence to bear in a condition of acute political uncertainty and fractured political process. We thank you our leaders from the depth of our heart.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached or lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a Consensus Presidential Aspirant. Rather, it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, RT Hon Aminu Tambuwal. Senator Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a Consensus Presidential Aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe above four named individuals not only initiated the Consensus Arrangement on their own volition but also agreed to fully and unequivocally abide by the decision that Gen Babangida will arrive at in consultation with other elders as well as accept, honour the steps and procedures he will deploy in arriving at any decision.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reject the current insinuations in the media from some quarters that purport that Gen Babangida and the elders either did not consult very widely or imposed a decision on an unwilling band of presidential aspirants. Gen Babangida and elders deserve nothing but commendation for the conclusions they reached and the outcome of the Consensus exercise by anybody, who believes in the tenets of truth, honour and integrity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the northern elders are scheduled to meet today in Asokoro, Abuja, to deliberate on the consensus report and the Wednesday planned NEC meeting of the PDP,\n\nBut the Arewa Youth, in a press statement by Suleiman Abubakar, the Director, Public Affairs, stated: \u201cAs we embark on the second phase of this critical assignment, the two aspirants chosen by our elders should work together with the support of other major stakeholders and decide on which of them should emerge as the sole consensus PDP northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe criteria used by the elders, revealed that the North-East in terms of zonal assessment have been considered as Governor Bala Mohammed was not the only individual from the zone, hence factors of equity, Justice and fairness should not be ignored in any attempt as we continue on this historic efforts.\n\n\u201cTo this end, with Bala Mohammed as northern consensus candidate, the rest of Nigerians will understand that as northerners, we have done justice to ourselves as Bala is a detribalised leader, who has been tested and trusted as former minister of the federal capital territory, an achiever per excellence as an incumbent governor of Bauchi state.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of readiness demonstrated by his Excellency, Bala Mohammed, since his endorsement by our elders to lead discussion with all other aspirants in the PDP with a view to having a national consensus if possible, is encouraging and this tells us that he is the man for the job, if we truly want to succeed,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Blue line at 90% completion\n\n*Laments vandalism of rail equipment\n\n\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, inspected the on-going construction of the Lagos Rail Line project and said the first quarter 2023 target for commencement of operational service was sacrosanct. Sanwo-Olu said the state was on track with its effort to complete work on both the Blue and Red lines rail projects, which are intra-city, to strengthen the intermodal transportation system.\n\nSpeaking at the Marina Station of the system after the inspection, Sanwo-Olu expressed satisfaction with the level of construction so far, saying additional trains are to be procured for speedy commencement.\n\nThe governor, however, warned those that had started vandalising the barricades around rail line to desist from the act, saying the tracks are hazardous. He added that, unlike the Red Line along Ikeja, Alagbado to Marina axis, the Blue Line from Marina to Mile 2 would be electric and people, including passengers, were not expected to walk on the tracks.\n\nHe said work on the Blue Line rail project was at 90 per cent completion, as contractors were working seven days a week so that Lagosians could start using the train by the first quarter of 2023.\n\nSanwo-Olu inspected the Blue line rail project alongside some of his cabinet members, top officials of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), and contractors handling the project. They moved from the National Arts Theatre rail station on a construction track to Orile Iganmu, Alaba and Mile 2 stations to inspect the four train stations on the Blue line rail.\n\nThe governor said the blue line rail would be running on electric tracks with Electric Motor Vehicle (EMV) and warned citizens to keep off the train lines.\n\nHe also inspected a new four-coach train, which, according to him, was a typical train that will be used on the blue line.\n\nHe disclosed the Lagos State government\u2019s plan to bring additional two sets of four-train coaches from China between September and October, adding that adequate security would be put in place at every train station and platform with the use of CCTV.\n\nSanwo-Olu told his entourage, \u201cThis is the first time I am taking you on the blue line to see where we are. The first phase of the Blue line rail project starts from Mile 2 and terminates at Marina. Marina Station is an elevated station and it stretches out to outer Marina and terminates where the Governor\u2019s residence is. At the end of the station, you could see that the track is broken into two bridges. The backtrack is for parking.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the contractors are working seven days a week. The major aspect, apart from the Marina Station, is a sea crossing from Eko Bridge to join the outer Marina. They would finish it in about three months. And by the time we will be coming back in July, the concrete construction should have been completed.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu condemned the level of vandalism along the rail corridors and warned perpetrators to desist from such evil acts.\n\nHe said the government would go after companies that purchased vandalised rail track infrastructure, adding that culprits will be traced and made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanwo-Olu yesterday issued a three-day ultimatum to traders under the Apogbon Bridge on Lagos Island to vacate or risk demolition of the space by Wednesday. He gave the warning while driving on the bridge during his inspection of the blue line rail project and observed that traders were back under the bridge with their goods displayed after they were driven away in the aftermath of a fire outbreak under the bridge about six weeks ago.\n\nThe governor said enforcement agencies would be deployed to the bridge after the ultimatum.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Denounce Babangida-backed Ango Abdullahi\u2019s report *PDP summons NEC meeting Wednesday *Tinubu, Umahi, others hosted by Aisha Buhari at Iftar\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Dutse\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal; former Governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, have rejected the emergence of a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed as the consensus presidential candidates for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the North.\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, Lamido, and Hayatu-Deen, who are all PDP presidential aspirants, have also denounced the report of Prof. Ango Abdullahi, which endorsed Saraki and Mohammed as the North\u2019s consensus presidential candidates with the backing of a former military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd).\n\nAs the controversy over the northern PDP presidential candidate deepens, the wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political divide at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThis is coming as the PDP yesterday summoned a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for Wednesday this week.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, \u201call members of the National Executive Committee of our great party are invited to the 96th NEC meeting\u201d scheduled to hold at the NEC Hall PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, at 2p.m.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the NEC meeting, which would take a final decision on the report of the 37-man committee on the zoning of presidential ticket of the party, was shifted from Thursday last week to Wednesday this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political parties divides at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe First Lady invited all presidential aspirants of all political parties, to the Ramadan Iftar, where he also hosted elected officials of the political parties.\n\nPresidential aspirants in attendance were: National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State (APC), and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nOther dignitaries include: Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; one-time National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Barnabas Gemade; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara; and oil and gas mogul, Tein Jack-Rich.\n\nOn the issue of the northern PDP presidential candidate, Abdullahi, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, had in a report said that Babangida had directed him to conduct a consensus exercise for four northern presidential aspirants \u2013 Saraki, Mohammed, Tambuwal, and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe report, which shortlisted Saraki and Governor Mohammed as the two northern presidential consensus candidates, urged Tambuwal and the investment banker and economist, Hayatu-Deen to drop their presidential ambition.\n\nThe report signed by Abdullahi said: \u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\u201d\n\nThe report also recommended that: \u201cThe two would, in turn, be required to make further concessions so that in the end, one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate, out of the four that presented themselves from the North.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi noted in the report that the four northern aspirants had visited Babangida and gave him the mandate to lead the process for a consensus and also agreed to abide by the outcome of the decision.\n\n\u201cThe former president encouraged the aspirants to have a resolution within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one out of the four, General Babangida on his part opted for inclusion, through wider consultation and assigned me to design criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with elders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\n\n\u201cThe process was conducted in the following three stages. In the first phase, the opinions of six distinguished persons each from the three geopolitical zones were sought with regards to each of the four aspirants, Each of the zonal delegates was allocated two votes to choose the first and second choice making a total of 36 votes overall. The outcome of that consultation was as follows:\n\n\u201c7 votes for the candidate (A) Aminu Waziri; 10 votes for the candidate (B) Bala Mohammed; 10 votes for the candidate (C) A-B Saraki; and five votes for the candidate (D), M Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the elders deferred his votes on grounds of continuing consultations with traditional rulers and other major stakeholders.\n\nThe report also stated that two members did not cast their second ballots bringing the total to 32 votes cast out of 36.\n\nIn its recommendation, which was approved by Babangida, the report endorsed Saraki and the Bauchi State governor.\n\nThe report also thanked all the aspirants and \u201cformer President Ibrahim Babangida for entrusting them with the conduct of this exercise and in the hope that all parties involved would continue with mutual consultations aimed at the overall success of the party.\n\n\u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Bala Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\n\n\u201cThe successful aspirants are hereby urged to work together to make allowance for further consultations to foster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancour-free primary election in which all eligible candidates would be free to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely commend the sportsmanship and statesmanship exhibited throughout the exercise by all those involved and urge continuous cooperation and teamwork to ensure victory for the party,\u201d the report explained.\n\nBut in a swift response, the Technical Committee for the Actualisation of Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Presidency in 2023, has dissociated the former vice president from the consensus arrangement. Atiku\u2019s Technical Committee, in its statement, noted that: \u201cThe report clearly stated that the aspirants who presented themselves for the exercise are: Governor Tambuwal, Governor Mohammed, Saraki, and Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nThe statement insisted that Atiku was never a part of the purported consensus arrangement and did not subject himself to this process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he is not bound by any of the recommendations and conclusions of the purported report. Waziri Atiku Abubakar as a nationalist strongly believes that Nigeria has never been so divided as it is today, and any regional, zonal, ethnoreligious gang-up or consensus-driven in this manner will further deepen and widen the wounds that urgently require to be healed,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement issued yesterday, the Director of Organisation and Mobilisation for Tambuwal Campaign Organisation, Nicholas Msheliza has also stated that the Sokoto State governor was not part of the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organisation (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger State.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.\n\nThe correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Senator Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm on the same day was aborted unilaterally by Senator Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, April 21, 2022, the same Senator Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday. Governor Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Governor Tambuwal was absent at the Friday meeting in Minna. As a result, therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Governor Tambuwal, who had earlier informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement added that Tambuwal had submitted his Presidential nomination forms, adding that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four had collapsed.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Sokoto State governor will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primary.\n\nAlso denouncing the controversial consensus report, former Jigawa State Governor, Lamido called on all members of the party in the northern states to ignore it.\n\nLamido, in a statement issued yesterday, argued that the report does not represent the opinions of members of the party in the 19 northern states.\n\n\u201cThe attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the northern states is drawn to reports in the media that some northern elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cHaving widely consulted party leaders across the 19 northern states and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what Is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North!\n\n\u201cDiscussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our party to have a national consensus if possible or at least working towards having smooth acrimony-free National Convention. The position of the northern elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the northern aspirants,\u201d Lamido explained.\n\nIn his reaction, Hayatu-Deen, in a statement by his campaign office, also stated that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed.\n\n\u201cThe candidates involved could not reach a compromise amongst themselves, resulting in the decision of our principal, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal to discontinue the process,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt described the committee constituted by Abdullahi as completely faceless and the evaluation criteria subjective.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that this entire charade was designed to achieve a preconceived outcome,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Leaders mourn monarch\n\n\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan have mourned the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, who died on Friday night at the age of 83, after 52 years on the throne.\n\nThe remains of Oba Adeyemi, who passed on at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, were committed to mother earth last night according to Islamic and traditional rites.\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar; National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, Governors Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun) and Gboyega Oyetola (Osun) have also paid glowing tributes to the late monarch.\n\n\n\nThe Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade II; the Emir of Ilorin and Chairman Kwara State Council of Chiefs, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari; and the Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has also mourned the death of the Oyo monarch.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement issued yesterday by his Media Adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, stressed that the Alaafin of Oyo\u2019s 52 years of rule was remarkable in many ways, most significant was the emphasis he placed on human development, thereby encouraging learning as a culture and formal education as a necessity while promoting values of peace and stability.\n\n\n\nAs a highly revered traditional ruler, President Buhari noted the late monarch\u2019s numerous involvements in national meetings and conferences to shape the future of the country, and the living words of wisdom he shared at every opportunity on unity and people-focused governance.\n\nIn his letter of condolence sent to Makinde, Obasanjo said Oba Adeyemi died \u201cat a crucial stage in our nation\u2019s history when his wise counsel and rich experience are greatly needed.\u201d\n\nA copy of the letter was made available to journalists yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by Obasanjo\u2019s Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi.\n\n\n\nThe former president described the monarch as a symbol of a nation\u2019s epic struggle for self-discovery and self-actualisation.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "text": "Twitter\u2019s 11-member board and Tesla CEO Elon Musk negotiated into the early hours of Monday over his bid to buy the social media platform, The New York Times reported.\n\n\n\nThis means that Twitter is nearing a deal to sell itself to Elon Musk, two people with knowledge of the situation said, a move that would unite the world\u2019s richest man with the influential social networking service.\n\nTwitter\u2019s board was negotiating with the world\u2019s wealthiest man, Mr. Musk into the early hours of Monday over his unsolicited bid to buy the company, after he began lining up $46.5 billion in financing for the offer last week, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential information.\n\n\n\nThe two sides were discussing details including a timeline to close any potential deal and any fees that would be paid if an agreement were signed and then fell apart, they said.\n\n\n\nThe discussions followed a Twitter board meeting on Sunday morning to discuss Mr. Musk\u2019s offer, the people said. Obtaining commitments for the financing was a turning point for how the board viewed Mr. Musk\u2019s bid of $54.20 a share, enabling the company\u2019s 11 board members to seriously consider his offer, the people said.\n\n\n\nAn agreement is not yet final and may still fall through, but what had initially seemed to be a highly improbable deal appeared to be nearing an endgame. The situation involving Twitter and Mr. Musk remains fluid and fast-moving, the people with knowledge of the situation said.\n\n\n\nMr. Musk, who has more than 83 million followers on Twitter and began amassing shares in the company earlier this year, declared his intent to buy the company on April 14 and take it private. But his proposal was quickly dismissed by Wall Street because it was unclear if he could come up with the money to do the deal. Twitter also adopted a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d a defensive manoeuvre that would prevent Mr. Musk from accumulating more of the company\u2019s stock.\n\n\n\nMr. Musk updated his proposal last week, putting pressure on Twitter to more seriously consider his bid.\n\nIn a securities filing that was made public on Thursday, Mr. Musk detailed how he had put together financing from the investment bank Morgan Stanley and a group of other lenders, which were offering $13 billion in debt financing, plus another $12.5 billion in loans against his stock in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs. He was expected to add about $21 billion in equity financing.\n\n\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIn previous public statements, the company had said its board was \u201ccontinuing to conduct a careful, comprehensive and deliberate review to determine the course of action in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal earlier reported Twitter\u2019s increased receptivity to Mr. Musk\u2019s bid.\n\n\n\nWall Street was likely to view the openness of Twitter\u2019s board to Mr. Musk\u2019s bid as \u201cthe beginning of the end for Twitter as a public company with Musk likely now on a path to acquire the company unless a second bidder comes into the mix,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note on Sunday.\n\n\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s offer for Twitter is a 54 percent premium over the share price the day before he began investing in the company in late January. But Twitter\u2019s shares traded higher than Mr. Musk\u2019s bid for much of last year.\n\n\n\nSeveral analysts have said they expected Twitter\u2019s board to only accept a bid that valued it at a minimum of $60 a share. Twitter\u2019s stock rose above $70 a share last year when the company announced goals to double its revenue, but has since fallen to around $48 as investors have questioned its ability to meet those targets.\n\n\n\nMr. Musk, 50, has made clear that he sees many deficiencies in Twitter as a social media service. He has said that he wants to \u201ctransform\u201d the company as a \u201cplatform for free speech around the globe\u201d and that it requires vast improvements in its product and policies.",

He told me that he only wanted to ask about what was going on on the campus since he wasn\u2019t on campus the previous day,\u201d she had written in the petition.\n\n\u201cI was astounded to hear that, but I told him to take the Road 7 route when ready to go home because road 1 was blocked. He asked me to sit down and he asked me the reason why the road was blocked. Then I told him that I didn\u2019t really know and heard that it was all about the appointment of the new VC.\n\n\u201cHe decided to leave the office immediately and he packed his things saying that I was God-sent to him because it was almost 2 pm and he needed to pick up his son from school. He carried the bag and we were about to leave the office. I offered to help him with the bag but he declined and I headed to the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe grabbed me from behind and held me so tight.

By this time, he had already pulled down his trousers and brought out his erect pen*s.\n\n\u201cHe grabbed my right hand, and used it to rub his pen*s. It happened so quickly that I was petrified. He continued to do this and I was so distressed by the entire situation that I lost count of time.\u201d\n\nReacting to the incident in a statement on Wednesday, Abiodun Olanrewaju, OAU\u2019s spokesman, dismissed allegations that the institution was foot-dragging in sanctioning the embattled professor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlanrewaju said a prima facie has been established against the professor, adding that the institution would announce its sanction in due course.\n\n\u201cThe unwholesome incident, which happened on March 18, 2022, prompted Boluwatife Hannah Bababunmi of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages, to write a petition to the university management against Joseph Ayo Opefeyitimi, a professor of Yoruba Incantations and Stylistics, of the same department, on March 21, 2022,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cProcedurally, after the receipt of the formal complaints, the first step was that the departmental committee sat on the matter and, after thorough investigation, Professor Opefeyitimi was found prima facie liable.\n\n\u201cSecond stage was the faculty level and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Professor Niyi Okunoye, referred the matter to the anti-sexual harassment committee of the university.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIt\u2019s the start of a new week, and I hope you had a good time. How was your weekend? Did you use my tips on Friday?\n\nI had a few conversations over the weekend, but one, in particular, stood out for me, and I believe it will be helpful to you, so I\u2019ll share.\n\nBlueroomcare, an online mental health platform, has announced a partnership with RelianceHMO to provide customised wellness plans at no cost to the employer or their employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Blueroomcare will provide mental health services to Reliance\u2019s customers. Customers, on the other hand, will need to know whether or not they qualify for therapy.\n\nFollowing my experience in February, I think this is a step in the right direction. I had contacted Reliance hoping that they would cover a mental health illness different from depression. I desperately needed the services of a therapist at that time.\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed me for a while, you\u2019ve probably noticed that I believe therapy is beneficial. Talking to someone you can trust relieves you, and a therapist helps clarify issues, explore options, develop strategies, and raise self-awareness.\n\nIf Blueroomcare\u2019s therapists are as qualified as they claim, this collaboration should yield positive results. I mean, following the #HorribleBosses trend on Twitter, another online mental health platform was literally dragged. Some of its customers claim that some of their therapists were unprofessional.\n\nAnyway, remember that your mental health is just as important as your physical and sexual health. So, while we raise a glass to a healthy and productive week, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nEquiano: A faster Internet connection\n\nWave\u2019s e-money licence\n\nEquiano: A faster Internet connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s Submarine Cable ship\n\nThis week looks wonderful. It\u2019s palpable, isn\u2019t it? Of course I have my reasons, and I\u2019ll share one with you.\n\nHere it is: Equiano, a cutting-edge submarine Internet cable, is set to arrive in Lagos, Nigeria, on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nFunded by Google, the Internet cable has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes) and is named after Olaudah Equiano, the historical abolitionist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tech behemoth, it will have 20 times the power and durability of the lat cable built to serve the West African region.\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? On average, your current mobile download speed is 18.7 Mbps. However, Google claims Equiano will provide 6x faster Internet, putting you above or below 112 Mbps.\n\nYou\u2019re still not getting it, are you? Let\u2019s try a scenario: A 1GB file will take more than 7 minutes to download at the current download speed of 18.7 Mbps. But Google\u2019s Internet cable could help reduce the download time to 1.2 minutes. Isn\u2019t this fascinating?\n\nClose your eyes for a moment and think about what this means for you if you work from home or rely on the Internet.\n\nWhat am I typing? Who doesn\u2019t rely on the Internet these days? Okay, maybe not everyone, but about a half of the Nigerian population does. Per Statista, Nigeria had 104 million active Internet users as of January 2021, accounting for roughly half of the total population.\n\nConsider what this means for the country\u2019s 104 million Internet users. Isn\u2019t it massive? I\u2019ll save you the trouble of imagining. Our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, provided an interesting viewpoint on what this means for you and how it can work.\n\nYou can read it here: What you need to know as Google\u2019s Equiano cable lands In Nigeria\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This was announced last Friday, April 22, 2022.\n\nThis e-money licence means Wave can now offer its current financial products to customers independently and directly, without the assistance of third-party banks.\n\nRecall that since its launch in 2018, Wave\u2019s mobile money business model has been powered by third-party banks like United Bank of Africa (UBA) and Ecobank.\n\nThe permit was issued by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), a central bank that serves the eight francophone West Africa countries that comprise the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).\n\nWhat exactly does the startup do? Wave offers free bill payments, free cash-in and cash-out, and a 1% transfer fee, making it roughly 70% cheaper than its competitors\u2019 traditional pricing structures.\n\nRemember that on Tuesday, September 7, 2021, the startup became the first Francophone Africa Unicorn after raising a $200 million Series A round at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nAnd now, with the licence, Wave will be able to offer a broader range of financial services, like merchant payments, savings, credit, and remittances, in collaboration with other partners in the WAEMU financial ecosystem.\n\nHowever, for now, the licence only applies to Wave\u2019s operations in Senegal. But, they hope to extend this licence very quickly to the other WAEMU countries so that its customer base in the region can benefit equally.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

Second, send a shout-out to Ogheneruemu, my copy editor. She does an excellent job with the newsletter.\n\nSo, how did your week go? I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "text": "Anyone would be forgiven for the expectation that Nigerian universities, especially the federal ones, should be primarily centres for the advancement of learning.\n\nThat they would be communities of scholars and students engaged in research, teaching and the promotion of cultural and religious tolerance. That the focus of the universities would be the instruction of skills and the promotion of the power of the mind.\n\nHowever, many have come to accept the mediocre, pedestrian, and general poor quality from our universities. Instead of the focus being on how to stretch the human mind for the purpose of Nigeria\u2019s development, the primary focus, in the last four decades, has been the establishment of ethnic and religious hegemonies.\n\nInvestigations show that since the late 1980s, Nigerian federal universities have been anything but federal in character and in principle.\n\nAll the universities, without exception, have focused on upholding prejudice and sectarianism.\n\nFor instance, there is no federal university in Nigeria today in which the vice-chancellor (VC) is not from the region and or the predominant religion in the region.\n\nFor instance, all federal universities in the North have VCs from the region, and same for the East, South-South, and West.\n\nIt is the culmination of the process that made some sections of Ife indigenes openly protest, demanding for an indigene of their Ife to be appointed the VC of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU).\n\nIn 2020, Ibadan aborigines led a protest to demand the appointment of an Ibadan indigene as VC.\n\nIt was in 2004 that the demand for a VC of Bini origin for the University of Benin reared its ugly head. The federal government was later bullied into appointing Bini aborigines as VCs.\n\nFor instance, the VC of the University of Ibadan in Oyo State is Kayode Adebowale from Ogun State;\n\nObafemi Awolowo University in Osun State has Eyitope Ogunbodede, from Ondo State, as VC;\n\nthe University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) in Enugu State has Charles Esimone, from Anambra State, as VC.\n\nThe VC of the University of Lagos is Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, from Lagos State;\n\nBayero University in Kano is led by Sagir Adamu Abbas, also from Kano State, while the VC of Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Kaduna State, is Kabiru Bala, from Kaduna State.\n\nRead also: ASUU berates NITDA, says UTAS scored 99.3%, best for university system\n\nThe VC of the University of Benin in Edo State is Lillian Salami, from Edo State, while her counterpart at Usman Dan Fodio University in Sokoto is Lawal Bilbis, from neighbouring Zamfara.\n\nDisturbingly, this pattern is not new. The last time a non-Yoruba man was VC in OAU was in 1982. Cyril Onwunechili was VC from 1979 to 1982.\n\nIn the University of Ibadan, it was in 1979, and Tekena Tanumo was the VC.\n\nIn Ahmadu Bello University, the last non-Hausa VC was Oladipo Akinkugbe, who held the position from 1978 to 1979.\n\nAt Ado Bayero University, the last non-Hausa VC was J.O.C Ezeilo, who held the position from 1978 to 1979.\n\nAt the UNN, the last non-Igbo VC was Umaru Gomwalk, who ran the school between May 1994 and 1999 as sole administrator.\n\nThe indigenisation of the leadership of universities including faculties and departments fails the students, the university system as centres of excellence, and the nation because, rather than promoting integration, it promotes segregation. Essentially, Nigeria\u2019s federal universities are only meant for those from the region and from the predominant religion in the area.\n\nWhile it is a given that institutions in Nigeria are polarised along income lines, the polarisation along ethnic and religious lines is even more toxic. Poor Nigerians have no choice over where to send their children, especially after primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe children of poor or lower-middle-class Nigerians who have attended primary and secondary schools in which they were denied the mix with children of diverse social classes are confronted with the same pattern of polarised education.\n\nInvestigations further show that the increasing selection, arguably not on merit, of people from the same region and predominant religious group, inadvertently continues the mediocrity in the recruitment of university officers further down.\n\nThis has gone on to generate mistrust and prejudice in the recruitment of students. It thus becomes unlikely for large numbers of students from the North to seek admission to universities in the South and vice-versa.\n\nSamuel Ukit, the dean of the School of Technical Education, Federal College of Education, Akoka, in Lagos State, said: \u201cThe unfortunate trend has been on for several years now even in federal colleges of education, which should not be.\n\n\u201cQualification should be the standard for choosing who to mount which office in our tertiary education sector, especially the federal government-established ones.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ukit, corruption is one major reason people, most times, would want the key offices to be given to a person from the ethnic group of the institution.\n\nMany times when people come from other regions, they do not seem to have a personal attachment to developing the education community where they found themselves.\n\nHowever, Ukit believes that the polarisation of offices in tertiary institutions will not generate mistrust and prejudice in the recruitment of students.\n\nHe cited the Federal College of Education (Technical) Akoka as an example, where he said people are admitted purely on merit irrespective of the fact that the indigenisation quest also is obtainable to some extent.\n\n\u201cOnce there is quality education, anyone can learn from any region and institution, provided he or she is qualified,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Information Communication ICT, Agency which has earned Edo State various local and national awards for ICT development, E-governance implementation and broad band penetration plans and programs has lived up to its mandate as the power house of the MEGA agenda revolution of the Governor Godwin Obaseki led administration.\n\nThis was disclosed at the weekend by Mr. Goodluck Igbinedion, Managing Director, ICT, Agency during the sixth session of the Webinar series by Edo State Ministry of Communication and Orientation in collaboration with Edo Media Connect Forum with the theme, E-Governance and the Civil Service Transformation Agenda: A Catalyst for institutional Reform in Edo State.\n\nHe said the mandate of the ICT agency is to provide a one stop shop for all technology solution, partner with government departments and agencies, ware house government data and automate government processes and build the e-literacy of the civil service and its employees, adding that in terms of implementation, the ICT agency developed the EdoGov program to automate all government operations.\n\n\u201cThis program has various approaches captured under three headings, Networked Government and Accessibility, Government presence and Open \u2013source E-citizen participation and collaboration and Data capture, Preservation , Privacy and Security. The EdoGov program has enabled an accessible, transparent, accountable and responsive centralization of all government operations to enhance decision making, improve public administration as well as contribute to inclusive democratic practices.\n\n\u201cThe government is ramping up quickly to connect all ministries, Departments and Agencies into a fully centralized process and the VPN is currently being installed to complete the connectivity of all public institution in Edo State. Apart from ensuring the integration of all administrative operations, business processes, reporting , human resource activities of Ministries and Departments and Agencies, the ICT Agency also provides broadband connectivity, digital equipment, document management system, onboarding of staff and training of all civil servants.\n\n\u201cThis is to ensure seamless and prompt information flow across the entire ecosystem, widen access for communication, promote smooth and coordinated knowledge creation within the civil service structures, enable prompt risk assessment and encourage interoperability of systems and processes. This approach is now being extended to local government areas and so far ten community proof of concept rural telephony projects are in place with ongoing surveys to assess density for effective deployment,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the Government Presence through Open-Source E-citizen to ensure transparency, participation and collaboration necessitated the incorporation of a user \u2013 interface in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tool so as to engage civil servants in planning and decision making across government structures and work is ongoing to introduce more open source tools and applications in government .\n\nMr. Igbinedion maintained that Edo State government has a three tier data management system with full proof data management coverage and back \u2013 up, cloud solution and security, data warehousing centre in Benin with up to date data management template and to ensure effective security and management of this repository, the system infrastructure is reliable and administered by certified data personnel with up to date knowledge of the legal, regulatory policy, ethical and technical issues in data management, availability, integrity, security and privacy.\n\nThe second speaker during the Webinar, Precious Imuwahen Ajoonu, Managing Director, John Odigie Oyegun Public Service Academy, maintained that knowledge economy and Information society sit at the heart of the MEGA Agenda of the Obaseki-led administration, therefore the John Odigie Oyegun Public Service Academy developed the EdoSTEP program and adopted three functional approaches to drive its cultural transformation agenda in the Edo State civil service and they include, pedagogical approaches, performance management and institutionalization.\n\n\u201cOn the pedagogical reform approaches the Public Service Academy has developed a system to assess the prior competencies of staff of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies in Edo State with a view to identifying their learning needs and developing bespoke contents to address those needs. In addition, a post training assessment measure is introduced as part of performance management approach to ensure the effectiveness of the evidence based training of civil servants.\n\n\u201cTherefore, a system of peer learning , training the trainer and infusion of trainers from the various communities of practice is being implemented under a cultural atmosphere of unlearning and relearning . The development of ICT labs and E- learning Management System in collaboration with the ICT Agency is in progress to shape and advance these initiatives ,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe performance management reform approach enabled the use of balance scorecard as a tool for measuring performance against set benchmarks on cultural transformation and the goal is to build high performance culture, instill a reward mechanism for improved cultural behaviors and codification of the processes. This reward system is being driven in collaboration with the head of service. On the institutional approach, the Public Service Academy is codifying its processes working on an enabling law and developing an operational play,\u201d she noted.\n\nBoth speakers, Precious Imuwahen Ajoonu and Mr. Goodluck Igbinedion enjoined Edo Citizens and inhabitants both at home and in Diaspora to support the E-Governance initiatives of the Obaseki led administration with a view to bringing the dividends of democracy to Edo people.\n\nIn his executive summary of the event which featured questions and answers from participants in Diaspora and across the nation, Chairman, Planning Committee, Dr. Ikpenmosa Uhumuavbi said the fundamental goal of the Godwin Obaseki led administration\u2019s drive to transforming the civil service system was chronicled by both speakers and critical to this assignment is the maintenance and enhancement of democratic processes in the state civil service within the context of opportunities and challenges that the information society brings\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Rising subsidy, debt hobble economic recovery",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere is a gloomy outlook for Nigeria\u2019s economic recovery drive, with inflating petrol subsidy payments posing serious threat to more growth-enhancing activities of both the federal and sub-national governments.\n\nThis is even as the situation is accounting heavily to more government borrowing, which is raising concerns of possible debt distress among economic experts.\n\nA plan by the government to deregulate the sector, following enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (2021) that prescribes a free market for the downstream sector of the petroleum industry has been abandoned, with the government seeking and obtaining legislative approval to spend N4 trillion on petrol subsidies in 2022.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the total cost of subsidy in January and February, 2022 alone was N396.72 billion, the cost of subsidizing the product in 2020 was N450 billion.\n\nPetrol subsidy payments grew by 349.42 per cent from N350 billion in 2019 to N1.573 trillion in 2021, propelled by the rising price of crude oil in the international market and the falling value of the Naira.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had previously disclosed that federal government spent N10.413 trillion on fuel subsidies between 2006 and 2019.\n\nAstronomical Rise\n\nThe Executive Secretary of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Mr Clement Isong, in a monitored interview on Tuesday, listed spike in the international price of crude oil, foreign exchange rate and high rate of petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders as three factors responsible for the astronomical rise in petrol subsidy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe first is the international cost of crude oil and the derivative products like Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) has gone up significantly as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine. So the price of crude itself, and the price of petrol, diesel and all products that come from petroleum have gone higher than they normally would be because of the war and the sanctions imposed on Russia, which is a major exporter of crude.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the rate of foreign exchange is exceedingly high right now. That is to say, the exchange rate for the Naira is at its highest level. Im not talking of the black market which is even higher, Im talking about the Central Bank of Nigeria rate which is N411-N414 to the dollar. It is higher than it has ever been historically.\n\n\u201cFinally, and this is the most important reason because you have capped the price, at one third or one quarter, of the price that it is across the borders, the propensity for the product to move across the borders is at the highest.\n\n\u201cWhat I mean by that is that so many people, ordinary Nigerians, ordinary human beings on both sides of the border engage in moving the product from the Nigerian side to the other side. Whether we are talking about Cameroun, Chad, Republic of Benin, Niger or Equatorial Guinea, this product goes to the whole Central and West African regions.\u201d\n\nIsong believes that ordinarily, the volume being imported into the country ought to be lower, but has been shot up by the activities of smugglers.\n\nDirector, Centre for Petroleum, Energy Economics and Law, University of Ibadan, Professor Adeola Adenikinju, noted that the governments decision to continue subsidy payment was more political than economic, given the revenue challenges facing governments at all levels.\n\nHe argued that by retaining the petrol subsidy, the government would find it difficult to meet other commitments.\n\n\u201cIt is a political decision, not an economic one. Economically, we know that subsidies have been very costly to the country and this is going to have serious implications on government revenue, particularly the state governments.\n\nThe states are going to feel it more because they depend heavily on revenue from the Federation Account and secondly, they do not have the leverage to borrow like the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf it goes ahead, the states are going to be hard-hit financially and it is going to be extremely difficult for them to meet all their commitments in terms of payment of salaries and keeping their obligations to pensioners.\u201d\n\nTriggering more borrowing\n\nReuters reported the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, as saying at the Arab-African Conference in Cairo, Egypt that fuel subsidy was widening governments deficit gap so much that it was considering tapping the 2 billion Euros it raised in the Eurobond sale last year to support its fiscal position.\n\nThe minister said that the administration would target more local borrowing this year to help fund the budget deficit which has been exacerbated by rising oil prices, due to Russias war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRising oil prices have put us in a very precarious position \u2026 because we import refined products \u2026 and it means that our subsidy cost is really increasing,\u201d Ahmed had noted.\n\nMeanwhile economic experts are kicking against the federal governments proclivity for debt, which they have described as unsustainable, calling for increased productivity with a view to boosting revenue.\n\nData from the Debt Management Office (DMO) showed a rise in Nigeria\u2019s total public debt from N32.92 trillion in 2020 to N39.56 trillion at the close of last year.\n\nOnly recently, the DMO revealed that the federal government has incurred N950bn new domestic borrowing between January 2022 and March 11, 2022.\n\nDisclosing the fresh borrowing in the presentation of the Public Debt Data as of December 31, 2021, the Director-General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, revealed that the federal government was considering all options to raise funds externally.\n\nAccording to the document, the federal government still plans to borrow an additional N1.6tn, while the 2022 debt target for domestic borrowing is N2.57tn. There is also a plan to borrow N2.57tn from foreign creditors, while N1.16tn is expected from multilateral/bilateral drawdowns.\n\nIn total, the federal government plans to add N6.3tn new debts to the current debt stock, which would push the countrys total debt stock to N45.86tn by December 2022.\n\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s current debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 22.47 per cent is relatively low, giving it room to borrow, its inability to generate adequate revenue has worsened its debt problem.\n\nThe debt to GDP ratio stood at 22.47 per cent compared to 21.61 per cent in 2020. At this level, the ratio is within Nigerias self-imposed limit of 40 per cent, the World Bank/IMFs recommended limit of 55 per cent for countries within Nigerias peer group, and 70 per cent for ECOWAS countries.\n\nNigerias revenue to GDP ratio has remained low at nine per cent compared to countries, such as Ghana at 12.5 per cent; Kenya at 16.6 per cent; Angola at 20.9 per cent; and South Africa at 25.2 per cent.\n\nReacting to the situation, an economist Dr Muda Yusuf, said the country is on the brink of debt distress.\n\nHe said, Nigeria is on the brink of debt distress because our debt profile now is not sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe had a debt service to revenue ratio getting to 76 per cent as of November last year. The situation is likely to get worse because our deficit in the 2022 budget is N6.4tn, and we need to borrow to finance the deficit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, the federal government has submitted a supplementary budget proposal for subsidy for N2.55tn after the budget was passed. Adding that to the deficit, we will get about N9tn.\n\n\u201cHow much is the revenue? It is just about N10.7tn, and we are not likely to get the full revenue, maybe 70 per cent. So, we are getting to a point whereby the time we service our debts, which should be around N4tn, and spend another N4tn on subsidy this year, we have consumed almost all our revenue for the year. Does that now mean that we are going to be using debt for personnel costs? For overhead?; for capital budget? That is where we are heading to.\u201d\n\nYusuf, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), regretted that instead of the country gaining from the increase in oil price like other oil-producing countries, the government is losing money on fuel importation and fuel subsidy\n\n\u201cWith the increase in oil price, the subsidy price will have to increase beyond what the NNPC requested. While other oil-producing companies are happy, as their reserves are increasing and currencies are getting stronger, we are lamenting because we are not getting the full benefit of the oil windfall,\u201d Yusuf said.",

          "text": "By BUKOLA LONGE\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the impact of the war in Ukraine is likely to sustain pressure on commodity prices, affecting oil and gas prices severely in 2022 and food prices well into 2023 in Nigeria and other countries of the world.\n\nThe Washington-based lender disclosed this in its World Economic Outlook: War Sets Back the Global Recovery April 2022, report.\n\nAccording to it, inflation is expected to remain high, and far longer than it had previously forecasted.\n\n\u201cWith the impact of the war in Ukraine and broadening of price pressures, inflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than in the previous forecast.\n\n\u201cThe conflict is likely to have a protracted impact on commodity prices, affecting oil and gas prices more severely in 2022 and food prices well into 2023 (because of the lagged impact from the harvest in 2022). For 2022, inflation is projected at 5.7 per cent in advanced economies and 8.7 per cent in emerging market and developing economies\u20141.8 and 2.8 percentage points higher than in the January World Economic Outlook.\n\n\u201cInflation in 2023 is projected at 2.5 per cent for the advanced economy group and 6.5 per cent for emerging market and developing economies (0.4 and 1.8 percentage points higher than in the January forecast).\n\n\u201cHowever, as with the growth outlook, considerable uncertainty surrounds these inflation projections.\u201d\n\nThe IMF added that energy and food prices contributed significantly to the headline inflation in 2021, in varying degrees across the regions.\n\nAccording to it, the sharp hike in oil and gas prices led to an increase in energy costs.\n\nThese increases were the main driver of headline inflation in Europe and to a lesser extent the United States.\n\nIn most emerging market and developing economies rising food prices also played a significant role, as poor weather hit harvests and rising oil and gas prices drove up the cost of fertilizer. Higher prices for international food commodities impact countries differently depending on the food share of households consumption baskets and the types of foods consumed.\n\nHouseholds in low-income countries are particularly exposed to changes in the price of staple cereals, with diets often concentrated in just one type of grain. Low-income countries where wheat, corn, and sorghum are a large part of the diet (especially in sub-Saharan Africa) have seen inflation almost wholly driven by rising food prices.\n\nIt added that commodity price increases are expected to persist through 2022 before easing, in a way, in 2023 with food inflation expected to be robust by 14 per cent in 2022, before declining by a small fraction in 2023.",

          "text": "National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has arrested Chief Afam Mallinson Emmanuel Ukatu, the drug baron allegedly behind the N3billion Tramadol deal involving the embattled suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari-led Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\n\nThe agency in a statement by Femi Babafemi, its spokesperson on Monday, said after months of surveillance and evading arrest, Ukatu who is Chairman of Mallinson Group of Companies was eventually nabbed onboard a flight to Abuja at the MM2 terminal of the Lagos airport, Ikeja on Wednesday 13th April.\n\nInvestigations, according to the statement, revealed he\u2019s been a major importer of large consignments of different brands and high dosages of Tramadol Hydrochloride, ranging from 120mg, 200mg, 225mg and 250mg, all of which are illicit. Ukatu owns pharmaceutical and plastic manufacturing companies, which he used as a cover to import illicit drugs into Nigeria. This is in addition to operating 103 bank accounts, most of which are used to launder money.\n\nUkatu came under watch last year after five cartons of Tramadol 225mg were seized from his staff on 4th May 2021 when he sent them to sell to undercover police officers (unknown to Ukatu) from the then Kyari-led IRT of the Nigeria Police, Ikeja Lagos. The price of a carton of Tramadol was negotiated at N17million each as against the then black market value that ranged between N18million and N20million a carton in Lagos.\n\nAfter the arrest of Ukatu\u2019s staff: Pius Enidom and Sunday Ibekwete, Kyari\u2019s men were then led by the suspects to Mallinson\u2019s warehouse at Ojota in Lagos where 197 additional Cartons of Tramadol 225mg were seized by the IRT Team. The monetary value of the 202 cartons of Tramadol seized from Mallinson in one day was over N3billion.\n\nThree weeks after the seizure, the Kyari\u2019s IRT team transferred only 12 Cartons of the Tramadol with one truck and a suspect to the Lagos Command of the NDLEA, leaving 190 cartons unaccounted for. After over eight months of following the lead, anti-narcotic officers of the Agency eventually arrested Ukatu at the Lagos airport on 13th April 2022. Kyari and four top members of his team are already facing trial for a different but similar offence at a Federal High Court in Abuja.",

He enjoined the residents not to take law into their hands.\n\nIt took the prompt intervention of the Police Commissioner, Mr. Oyediran, who had arrived the town, Amotekun Corps and other security agencies, to calm the frayed nerves and appeal to the angry youths for peace.\n\nBut the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Funmilayo Odunlami, dispelled the recklessness allegation against the police, saying that the deceased flouted traffic law and incidentally had an accident.\n\n\u201cIt was not due to the recklessness of the police officers, they took one way and they had an accident. So there was no way the police can be reckless in a situation whereby there is a route to take and they took another one.\n\n\u201cOf course it was an oncoming vehicle that they collided with and died, it was not police recklessness there,\u201d the PPRO said.",

The ball is in their court. They should go and meet the Benimi Briggs Committee and look at what the committee is doing and make further inputs so that the work can be accelerated.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with our correspondent on Sunday, ASUU President Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke said it was humiliating for Ngige to encourage the union to work with a party other than the government.\n\nHe went on to say that the union may have no choice but to extend the strike after it expires.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe rollover ends in two weeks, and there is no information, nothing new from the FG. They didn\u2019t make any effort to get in touch with us or seek ways of ending the strike.\n\n\u201cOur members will decide after two weeks what step to take. We will meet. We are not begging them for discussion; they should invite us for any meeting. That\u2019s the way it should be. We are not on strike with Ngige or Briggs but against the government, so why is he saying we should go and meet one committee or one person? We are on strike against a system.

          "text": "The row generated by the consensus arrangement among some presidential aspirants within the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) has generated further row, with the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) distancing itself from the plan.\n\nThe quartet of Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Bauchi state Governor Abdulkadir Bala Mohammed, former Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki and renown economic expert and seasoned banker, Mohammed Hayatuo-Deen, had traversed the length and breadth of the country championing the consensus arrangement.\n\nBut the arrangement collapsed when the duo of Bala and Saraki from the North-east and North-central respectively, were announced by a committee of northern leaders and presidential aspirants within the party.\n\nThe exercise in stages\n\nThe committee\u2019s recommendations were contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed weekend by former Vice-Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nThey said the decision to elect both Saraki and Bala was based on certain criteria adopted in the assessment of the four aspirants who submitted themselves for the exercise.\n\nPrior to the election, the four aspirants visited former Military President Ibrahim Babangida, and asked him to lead the process for a consensus, with a promise to abide by the outcome of the decision.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal and Mr Hayatu-Deen were also reported to have presented themselves for the election.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 quoted Abdullahi as saying that a leading aspirant from the North-central and one from the North-east would be presented as northern presidential candidates.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 also said, the two \u201cwould in turn be required to make further concessions so that in the end, one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nIn phase one of the exercise called \u201ccandidates assessment,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 said leaders sought the opinions of six persons from the three geo-political zones who were asked to also cast their votes.\n\n\u201cAt the end of this phase, Saraki and Gov. Mohammed scored 10 votes each while Tambuwal and Hayatu-Deen got seven and five votes respectively,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 said.\n\nIn phase two which was on \u201czonal assessment\u201d, Saraki got eight votes, while Bala and Tambuwal got seven and two votes respectively, with Hayatu-Deen scoring zero.\n\nIn the third phase, Abdullahi said resort was made to the historical antecedents of the PDP with regards to previous northern aspiration and the following conclusion was reached.\n\n\u201cThat the North-west has had the opportunity of contesting and even forming government in 2007.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, a consensus was made among the four northern candidates, which North-east got but lost at the primaries. In 2019, it got the slot again though the party could not form the government.\u201d\n\nThe panel also noted that the North-central has not had a single opportunity to get the PDP ticket since the inception of the current fourth republic.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Gov. Bala Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 therefore urged both Saraki and Bala to \u201cfoster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancour-free primary in which all eligible delegates would be free to exercise their right.\u201d\n\nBut the duo of Tambuwal and Hayatou-Deen had since rejected the decision, saying they were not in any way part of it and not based on the principle of equity and transparency.\n\nNEF disowns decision\n\nAnd amid the raging controversy, the NEF said it was not part of any process in producing a consensus candidate for the PDP ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement made available to this medium Sunday, NEF Director Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the group\u2019s convener, Professor Abdullahi, acted in his personal capacity.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cIt has become necessary to address the impression created in part by mischief and in part by genuine confusion over the role of the Convener of Northern Elders Forum in the efforts to create consensus among four aspirants for the Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe idea to attempt to engineer a consensus among the aspirants was that of the aspirants themselves. Governors Aminu W Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed, former Senate President A.B.Saraki and Malam Mohammed Hayatou-Deen had informed President Badamasi Babangida of their intention, and requested elderly intervention and advise in the event that their efforts failed to produce consensus.\n\n\u201cPresident Babangida in turn requested Professor Ango Abdullahi in his individual capacity to design and manage a process that could improve a consensus agreement among the four aspirants. Professor Ango Abdullahi concluded that assignment and released a detailed report and recommendation, signing it in his individual capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to make clear that the entire process did not involve the Northern Elders Forum as a group, and is not a product of the group. Professor Ango Abdullahi is free to undertake any lawful activity as a citizen, and genuine misinterpretations of his role are understandable.\n\n\u201cNorthern Elders Forum is not affiliated to any political party or aspirant and is strongly committed to the creation of a level playing field, which will allow the emergence of the best leaders in the 2023 elections. It has also remained consistent in its conviction that all parts of the country should play their parts freely, unhindered by restrictions which offend principles of inclusion and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe Forum believes the North has excellent candidates whose fate should be left to party delegates and voters to decide. The Forum remains united behind the protection and projection of interests of the North and Nigeria, and will play its role as it had done whenever circumstances demand,\u201d Baba-Ahmed further added.\n\nBala furthers campaign\n\nNotwithstanding the controversy around the consensus, Governor Bala Mohammed has promised to build on it and unfold his vision in a matter of days.\n\nIn a statement Sunday by his campaign manager, Professor Udenta O. Udenta, the aspirant commended Gen. Babangida and other northern leaders for their \u201cthankless and patriotic duty to bring order to bear in political uncertainty.\u201d\n\nHe said Babangida never approached nor lobbied them to superintend the process that led to the emergence of consensus presidential aspirants.\n\nUdenta said: \u201cThe Sen. Bala Mohammed Campaign Organization will not join issues with anybody on the question of the consensus arrangement because the truth needs no further protection from its traducers but will rather press on in rallying the nation around its progressive \u201cNigeria First\u201d Governance Vision on the heels of the successful execution of the Consensus Arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe Campaign Organization, however, advises all those who are not happy with the result of the selection process or who did not participate in it to focus on their political trajectories without let or hindrance and not muddy the political waters any further.\n\n\u201cLet us clarify to the millions of members and supporters of the PDP that the Consensus Arrangement was not designed as an end in itself but as means to an end; not as a goal with a limited regional vision or appeal but first in the series of processes and exercises aimed at building inclusiveness, harmony and unity within the ranks of the Presidential Aspirants in the PDP.\u201d\n\nThe organisation further said0S\u201denator Bala Mohammed believes strongly that the search for consensus, unity, solidarity and shared vision among the PDP presidential aspirants is a worthy move and a patriotic venture that aims at reducing unnecessary tension, acrimony and unhealthy diatribe among competitors.\u201d\n\nDecision can\u2019t be faulted \u2013Saraki\n\nIn a similar position, Senator Saraki described the northern elders\u2019 decision as a welcome development that cannot be faulted.\n\nSpeaking through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the two-term governor of Kwara state said the process of arriving at the consensus aspirants was pain-staking, thorough and transparent.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a welcome development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent.\n\n\u201cOne needs to commend and appreciate the elders who worked to actualise the process. May Allah bless them all. Their decision was based on equity, justice, and the need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process which can help the party later on.\n\n\u201cThe process is a work-in-progress. One person will still emerge from the ongoing process here in the North. The South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East.\n\n\u201cA nation like Nigeria with all the current problems needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking during a visit to the PDP secretariat in Minna, Niger state, Saraki said he was ready to go into the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe carried ourselves to the elders to intervene and select a consensus candidate from among us. They left their comfort zone to attend to our request. I appreciate them, especially our elder statesman, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babaginda.\u201d\n\nSaraki further said the issue of consensus is an individual decision which cannot be imposed, adding \u201cI am ready for primaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the turn of the North Central to produce the President. It is our time. Nigeria has not been this bad. We must do something about insecurity. We must rebuild the country together. There will not be bandits and terrorists when I become the President,\u201d said the former governor.\n\nIn a goodwill message, former governor of Niger state, Dr Muazu Babaginda Aliyu described Saraki as a dependable and reliable leader capable of rescuing the nation from its present predicaments.\n\nIt\u2019s fraudulent \u2013 Tambuwal, Hayatou-Deen\n\nHowever, Governor Tambuwal has disowned the process that produced the consensus candidates.\n\nIn an interview with DW Hausa Service monitored by Blueprint in Abuja, the governor sought to know the identities of those that came up with the choices.\n\n\u201cWho were the people that gave the advice to reach that conclusion? Nobody has this information. I consulted the party leadership across the country, especially the Northern PDP leaders but no one is aware of what\u2019s going on, indicating that something fishy is going on.\n\n\u201cIf not, we are the ones that took ourselves to them to help the process, and later withdrew. Why should anyone insist the process of consensus must continue?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in any way reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters. I am not involved in any of such. I am still in the race, I am seeking victory from God and in his mercy, He will give me,\u201d Tambwal said.\n\nAnd like Tambuwal, Hayatou-Deen, through his campaign office said: \u201cFor the record, we would like to state that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed. The candidates involved could not reach a compromise amongst themselves, resulting in the decision of our principal, Mohammed Hayatou-Deen, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal to discontinue the process.\n\n\u201cThe announcement we witnessed yesterday (Friday) was not based on the principles of equity and transparency, which we believe should lead the country and the party into the future. The committee constituted by Prof. Ango Abdullahi is completely faceless and the evaluation criteria is totally subjective.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that this entire charade was designed to achieve a preconceived outcome.\n\nProcess undemocratic \u2013Lamido\n\nAlso, the immediate past governor of Jigawa state, Dr Sule Lamido, has described the process leading to both Saraki and Bala\u2019s emergence as undemocratic.\n\nIn a statement weekend, the former governor said the decision was injurious to the North and its future politics.\n\nHe also warned that \u201cthe position of the Northern Elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the Northern Aspirants\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the Northern State is drawn to the reports in the Media that some Northern Elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP Presidential Candidates.\n\n\u201cThose views across 19 Northern states and the FCT indicated that what was reported in the media was only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North.\n\n\u201cDiscussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our Party with a view to having a National Consensus if possible or at least working towards having a smooth acrimony-free National Convention,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nPrint\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Presidency has attributed the delayed delivery of 12 Super Tucano jet fighters for the Nigerian Air Force to fight insecurity across the country to comments by those it described as \u201cthe opponents of the Nigerian government\u201d including Catholic Bishop of Diocese of Sokoto Mathew Kukah.\n\nThe Presidency revealed that the reasons given for the delay\u2014poor interreligious relations between Christianity and Islam in the country\u2014were compounded by constant lobbying of US Congress by the government\u2019s opponents, including Kukah.\n\nThese were contained in a statement Sunday by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu, titled \u2018Predicting Nigeria\u2019s collapse is a perennial pursuit of US think tanks and policy experts.\u2019\n\nIt also said the United States\u2019 policy and support to Nigeria have been so inconsistent over the years, especially as regards the provision of military equipment to fight the decade-long insecurity in the Sahel region.\n\nThe presidency also berated the US policy experts and think tanks for their perennial attempts at predicting the country\u2019s collapse; which, it said, does not paint a true picture of a country that has enjoyed 23 years of steady democracy 29 years since its last coup.\n\nThe statement partly read: \u201cIt is a pity therefore that US policy and support towards our country, including during the Buhari administration, has been so inconsistent.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 the then newly-elected Buhari government requested US military support in the form of Super Tucano jet fighters for the Nigerian Air Force. The Nigerian military, security, and intelligence services repeatedly made this request. The US administration of the time concurred: the delivery of such jets would help deliver a critical turning point in Nigeria\u2019s struggle against jihadist terrorists across the Sahel.\n\n\u201cYet two years later, that jet delivery was rescinded, the reasons given that unless Nigeria improved its religious relations between Christianity and Islam then US support would not be forthcoming in this, and many other areas.\n\n\u201cSuch views were compounded by the constant lobbying of US Congress by the opponents of the Nigerian government who had lost the previous election, and many of their southern religious supporters\u2014including Bishop Mathew Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Diocese of Sokoto, who, unsurprising, provides a supportive quote for the dustcover of the new edition of Campbell\u2019s book. (Kukah even took to addressing the US Congress himself, briefing his audience on the history of coups in Nigeria\u2014without, of course, mentioning that none had occurred since 1993, some 29 years ago).\n\n\u201cFortunately, now today under a new US administration these jets have been delivered, and with it, a serious blow against the terrorists\u2014with the supreme leader of Islamic State in West Africa and scores of other leaders of the group eliminated in airstrikes.\n\n\u201cIt is also inconsistent to preach the need for stability but needlessly delay sharing military equipment in the form of jets \u2013 not least when it is now proven they would have helped Nigeria much earlier defeat the terrorists who threaten our country.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency also lamented that despite glaring contrary evidence predictors of Nigeria\u2019s state collapse have continued to bet big on their word.\n\nIt said, \u201cIn 2005, a US National Intelligence Council paper \u201cMapping Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s Future\u201d floated the idea there could be a military coup in Nigeria. However, for the last 29 years\u2014close to a generation\u2014there have been none.\n\n\u201cSince the return of democracy in 1999 there have been six general elections, four elected presidents, four transfers of power\u2014including one in 2015 between the winning opposition candidate and the losing incumbent president seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cYet despite all the evidence to the contrary, the collapse predictors keep doubling down on their bets. Most recently retired former US Ambassador to Nigeria 2004-7 John Campbell has updated his book, of which the first edition said:\n\n\u201cWhile Nigerians often claim they are masters of dancing on the brink without falling off, the disastrous administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, the radical Islamic insurrection Boko Haram, and escalating violence in the delta and the north may finally provide the impetus that pushes it into the abyss of state failure.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t of course, quite the opposite: Jonathan was defeated at the 2015 general election with power peacefully transferring to the victor, President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nPrint\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

He also affirmed that Blockchain would be central in the implementation of the National e-Govt Masterplan.\n\nThe BPSR Chief Executive equally listed the introduction of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), the Bank Verification Number (BVN), automation of enforcement activities of some agencies of the government, including the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), as well as automated performance measurement systems for public sector employees, as concrete examples of the utilisation of technology in the public sector.\n\nArabi asserted that Nigeria ranks third in Africa, in the use of telecommunications for public service delivery, coming behind South Africa and Egypt. Arabi called on policymakers to ensure robust policy formulation that ensures improved digital literacy and increased automation in public service delivery.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim Lagos\n\nTHE governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele has said, the apex bank is expecting that the foreign exchange needed for the importation of petroleum products will decline by the end of this year when the Dangote Refinery commences operation.\n\nEmefiele, speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing World Bank/ International Monetary Fund 2022 Spring Meetings in Washington DC said the country is working on merging its exchange rate on the various markets.\n\nThis was in reaction to the president of the World Bank, David Malpass, who had mentioned on Wednesday, at a press conference that, the multiple exchange rates in the country is not encouraging to investors and also not an effective way of managing the country\u2019s exchange rate.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the CBN is working on a home grown solution at merging the exchange rates even as he said there is need to first merge the level of demand with that of supply. \u201cWhat we do expect is that to develop a home grown solution that will lessen the situation.\n\n\u201cNigeria is on a managed float and what that also means is that we cannot adopt what is being proposed that we go on a free float, doing that will create an exchange rate spiral for Nigeria as long as the demand surpass the supply of foreign exchange in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith the Dangote Refinery coming up with the 650,000 barrels per day hopefully by around the end of the year. That will also start to also reduce the demand for foreign exchange that will normally will go for importation of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cI have often said between the importations of refined products alone, importation or whether it is rice or sugar or wheat, consumes close to about 40 per cent of foreign currency that is needed to fund imports in Nigeria. And if we find for instance, a situation were by around the end of this year, we\u2019re able to begin to see we are no longer going to be needing foreign import petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWe have been at this since 1986 and that is why we are saying that whereas, we are doing something to adjust the currency like for instance between 2015 and now, you would observe that we have adjusted the currency from about N155 to about N420 that it is today.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot be accused of not adjusting the currency that we are trying to adopt a very gradual approach towards adjusting the price to the level that it is today but at the same time. We have to be given a chance to also look at while we are adjusting price, we must also do something about demand and supply.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason we are saying that we need to do something on demand to make sure that those things that we can produce in the country we restrict access to foreign exchange for them so, that that will encourage people to produce locally. When that happens. What it will mean is that the demand for foreign exchange will reduce and when demand for it reduces ultimately you will find that price will not rise beyond the expectation of Nigerians and we are achieving that.\n\n\u201cToday, we have done a lot in intervention in agriculture. Is it your rice, we have stopped the import of rice. We have stopped import of maize. Right now no foreign exchange for importation of rice or maize, very little amount for wheat.\n\n\u201cI believe that demand will drop as demand drops, what you will find is that whatever supply we have is able to merge with demand and then we can see a stable exchange. That is what we\u2019re trying to do and I imagine that by the time we achieved this, we will continue to engage with World Bank or the IMF,\u201d he pointed out.",

Due to the limited quantity of food to be consumed by people this additional quantity of cooked or made food becomes waste as Iftar is not usually eaten as night snacks or as Suhoor the next day. The demand for fresh food increases as majority of people are willing to spend an extra amount for the better quality of food.\n\nOne global brand that have continuously rethink how food wastage can be better managed is home appliance leader, LG Electronics.

          "text": "The Presidency has criticized opponents of government for influencing the perception of the United States government of Nigeria which is believed to have led to delays in the supply of fighter jets to the country to boost the fight against insecurity.\n\nAccording to a statement issued on Sunday by Presidential Spokesman Garba Shehu, one of those opponents includes the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah.\n\nIn the statement titled: \u2018Predicting Nigeria\u2019s Collapse Is A Perenial Pursuit Of US Think Tanks And Policy Experts\u2019, Shehu maintained that the clergyman provided quotes from a book written by former US Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, which the Presidency observed do not suggest much improvement in the country.\n\nBut despite previous predictions of coups in the country, democracy has remained unbroken for the past 29 years.\n\nRead Full statement below.\n\nPredicting Nigeria\u2019s Collapse Is A Perennial Pursuit Of Us Think Tanks And Policy Experts\n\nIn 2005, a US National Intelligence Council paper \u2018Mapping Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s Future\u2019 floated the idea there could be a military coup in Nigeria. At the time this was hardly an earth-shattering prediction: 2005 was only six years after the return of civilian democratic rule and just over a decade since the Abacha military coup of 1993 \u2013 the final of seven coups since independence.\n\nHowever, for the last 29 years \u2013 close to a generation \u2013 there have been none. Since the return of democracy in 1999 there have been six general elections, four elected presidents, four transfers of power \u2013 including one in 2015 between the winning opposition candidate and the losing incumbent president seeking re-election.\n\nYet despite all the evidence to the contrary, the collapse predictors keep doubling down on their bets.\n\nMost recently retired former US Ambassador to Nigeria 2004-7 John Campbell has updated his book, of which the first edition said: \u201cWhile Nigerians often claim they are masters of dancing on the brink without falling off, the disastrous administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, the radical Islamic insurrection Boko Haram, and escalating violence in the delta and the north may finally provide the impetus that pushes it into the abyss of state failure\u201d.\n\nIt didn\u2019t of course, quite the opposite: Jonathan was defeated at the 2015 general election with power peacefully transferring to the victor, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nCampbell is always more careful than others who openly claim their predicted collapse is just around the corner. Still, it is always there, as innuendo: \u201cI have never predicted the breakup of Nigeria because I have never thought it would happen.\n\nBut, were it to do so, the likely consequence would be a humanitarian disaster\u201d \u2013 said Campbell in a blog post in 2012 for the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) think-tank.\n\nThat same CFR is now publishing the new edition of Campbell\u2019s book. It seems unlikely the conclusion will be that Nigeria is improving on any measure as \u2013 for international Nigeria watchers \u2013 there seems little that can ever be found to suggest it is.\n\nYet the people of Nigeria \u2013 the majority of which were born after the last coup of 1993 \u2013 and who have known nothing their whole lives except democracy and elected government are the living proof that democracy is here to stay.\n\nThough often negative, Campbell does however consistently express an important view that it is in the interests of the United States to encourage democracy and security in Nigeria. The government of Nigeria concurs. It is a pity therefore that US policy and support towards our country, including during the Buhari administration, has been so inconsistent.\n\nIn 2015 the then newly-elected Buhari government requested US military support in the form of Super Tucano jet fighters for the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThe Nigerian military, security, and intelligence services repeatedly made this request.\n\nThe US administration of the time concurred: the delivery of such jets would help deliver a critical turning point in Nigeria\u2019s struggle against jihadist terrorists across the Sahel.\n\nYet two years later, that jet delivery was rescinded, the reasons given that unless Nigeria improved its religious relations between Christianity and Islam then US support would not be forthcoming in this, and many other areas.\n\nSuch views were compounded by the constant lobbying of US Congress by the opponents of the Nigerian government who had lost the previous election, and many of their southern religious supporters \u2013 including Bishop Mathew Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Diocese of Sokoto who, unsurprising, provides a supportive quote for the dustcover of the new edition of Campbell\u2019s book. (Kukah even took to addressing the US Congress himself, briefing his audience on the history of coups in Nigeria \u2013 without, of course, mentioning that none had occurred since 1993, some 29 years ago).\n\nFortunately, now today under a new US administration these jets have been delivered, and with it, a serious blow against the terrorists \u2013 with the supreme leader of Islamic State in West Africa and scores of other leaders of the group eliminated in airstrikes.\n\nIt is all very well to claim it is in the United States\u2019 interests to help Nigeria become an even-better democracy and stable country. It is quite another to forever avoid mentioning the last coup was 29 years ago, and that since 1999 Nigeria has enjoyed 23 unbroken years of democratically elected governments and peaceful transition between them.\n\nIt is also inconsistent to preach the need for stability but needlessly delay sharing military equipment in the form of jets \u2013 not least when it is now proven they would have helped Nigeria much earlier defeat the terrorists who threaten our country. Hopefully, the United States and Nigeria are going to forge ahead with our continuing partnership in fighting terrorism in and out of the sub-region.\n\nThe dream of our founding fathers of a strong, united and prosperous Nigeria remains very much intact.",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Sunday, inspected the on-going construction of the Lagos Rail Line project and said the first quarter 2023 target for commencement of operational service was sacrosanct. Sanwo-Olu said the state was on track with its effort to complete work on both the Blue and Red lines rail projects, which are intra-city, to strengthen the intermodal transportation system.\n\nSpeaking at the Marina Station of the system after the inspection, Sanwo-Olu expressed satisfaction with the level of construction so far, saying additional trains are to be procured for speedy commencement.\n\nThe governor, however, warned those that had started vandalising the barricades around rail line to desist from the act, saying the tracks are hazardous. He added that, unlike the Red Line along Ikeja, Alagbado to Marina axis, the Blue Line from Marina to Mile 2 would be electric and people, including passengers, were not expected to walk on the tracks.\n\nHe said work on the Blue Line rail project was at 90 per cent completion, as contractors were working seven days a week so that Lagosians could start using the train by the first quarter of 2023.\n\nSanwo-Olu inspected the Blue line rail project alongside some of his cabinet members, top officials of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), and contractors handling the project. They moved from the National Arts Theatre rail station on a construction track to Orile Iganmu, Alaba and Mile 2 stations to inspect the four train stations on the Blue line rail.\n\nThe governor said the blue line rail would be running on electric tracks with Electric Motor Vehicle (EMV) and warned citizens to keep off the train lines.\n\nHe also inspected a new four-coach train, which, according to him, was a typical train that will be used on the blue line.\n\nHe disclosed the Lagos State government\u2019s plan to bring additional two sets of four-train coaches from China between September and October, adding that adequate security would be put in place at every train station and platform with the use of CCTV.\n\nSanwo-Olu told his entourage, \u201cThis is the first time I am taking you on the blue line to see where we are. The first phase of the Blue line rail project starts from Mile 2 and terminates at Marina. Marina Station is an elevated station and it stretches out to outer Marina and terminates where the Governor\u2019s residence is. At the end of the station, you could see that the track is broken into two bridges. The backtrack is for parking.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the contractors are working seven days a week. The major aspect, apart from the Marina Station, is a sea crossing from Eko Bridge to join the outer Marina. They would finish it in about three months. And by the time we will be coming back in July, the concrete construction should have been completed.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu condemned the level of vandalism along the rail corridors and warned perpetrators to desist from such evil acts.\n\nHe said the government would go after companies that purchased vandalised rail track infrastructure, adding that culprits will be traced and made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanwo-Olu yesterday issued a three-day ultimatum to traders under the Apogbon Bridge on Lagos Island to vacate or risk demolition of the space by Wednesday. He gave the warning while driving on the bridge during his inspection of the blue line rail project and observed that traders were back under the bridge with their goods displayed after they were driven away in the aftermath of a fire outbreak under the bridge about six weeks ago.\n\nThe governor said enforcement agencies would be deployed to the bridge after the ultimatum.\n\nSegun James",

          "title": "Nigeria: We\u2019re Not Involved in PDP Consensus Arrangement, Northern Elders Say",
          "text": "The ripples generated by the consensus report of some northern elders, which endorsed former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and the Bauchi State governor as the preferred Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) northern presidential candidates, assumed another dimension on Sunday after the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), umbrella body for the northern establishment, dissociated itself from the initiative with an effort to correct certain misgivings.\n\nThis is as some of those concerned have also continued to state their own accounts of what happened, while the others, defended and justified the report, authored by Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nWhile, the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who had maintained a rebellious stance since inception, queried who the northern elders commissioned General Ibrahim Babangida were, Saraki, on his part, commended the report, stating it was a thorough and painstaking efforts that ought to be commended by all.\n\nMohammed too commended the former military president and explained that the report was not an imposition.\n\nOn the contrary, a group known as the United Arewa Youth For Justice and Development, has thrown its weight behind the decision of the northern elders over the endorsement of Mohammed and Saraki as northern presidential consensus candidates of the PDP ahead of the 2023, presidential primaries of the party.\n\nHowever, NEF, in a statement by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the forum was not involved in the process as a body, it further insisted it was not affiliated to any political party or aspirant as it were, adding that the idea to engineer a consensus among the aspirants was that of the aspirants themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make clear that the entire process did not involve the Northern Elders Forum as a group, and is not a product of the group. It has become necessary to address the impression created in part by mischief, and in part by genuine confusion over the role of the Convener of Northern Elders Forum, in the efforts to create consensus among four aspirants for the Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\n\u201cNorthern Elders Forum is not affiliated to any political party or aspirant, and is strongly committed to the creation of a level playing field, which will allow the emergence of the best leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe forum stated that, it has also remained consistent in its conviction that all parts of the country should play their parts freely, unhindered by restrictions, which offend principles of inclusion and fairness, adding that, the North has excellent candidates whose fate should be left to party delegates and voters to decide.\n\nIt further maintained that it remained united behind the protection and projection of interests of the North and Nigeria, and would play its role as it has always done whenever the circumstances demanded.\n\nTambuwal, speaking with newsmen, queried the report saying, \u201cTell us who are the elders that sat down to come up with that decision? Who are the people that gave advice to reach that conclusion? Nobody has this information.\n\n\u201cI consulted the party leadership across the country especially, the Northern PDP leaders but no one is aware what\u2019s going on, indicating that something fishy is going on. If not, we are the ones that took ourselves to them to help the process, and later withdrew, why should anyone insist the process of consensus must continue?\n\n\u201cSo, based on this, I didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in anyway reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters. I am not involved in any of such. I am still in the race, I am seeking victory from GOD and in his mercy, God will give me,\u201d he stated.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWe discussed the possibility of agreeing on one candidate within our group to represent us (Initially not even to represent the whole North) and we all agreed based on the situation of the party.\n\n\u201cWe started consultations based on that, and the fourth person that joined us is also another presidential aspirant Mohammad Hayatou-deen. In order for people not to perceive that may be we are trying to fight the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, we also went to consult him and seek his blessings.\n\n\u201cHe was happy about it but he didn\u2019t show any interest to join us. That was how we continued our consultations. Along the line, we discussed that we really need an elder in the country, who will help us reach our goal amicably in case we may encounter any disagreement along the line within ourselves and we all agreed that we should take the matter to former president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida in Minna.\n\n\u201cWe explained to him and he immediately agreed. He was very happy. And he promised to do his best to help us achieve our mission. However, we had to at a point tell ourselves the truth. The four of us met in Bauchi State government diplomatic House in Abuja on Wednesday, we looked into the issue from all angles and we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible and we cannot continue the process, everyone should embark on independent struggle, and whosoever GOD gives the ticket to, its ok.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that senator Bukola Saraki will organise a press conference and inform the public about the outcome. Without consulting us, Bukola Saraki on his own sent us message that we need to go to Minna and see Babangida after all that wasn\u2019t part of what we agreed upon in our meeting. I communicated with Governor of Bauchi Bala Mohammed whether he received same message which he did.\n\n\u201cWe went and met Bukola Saraki. But at that point, I made it categorically clear to them that for the sake of GOD, that we didn\u2019t agree on that; our agreement was that consensus candidate isn\u2019t possible, why should we go and suffer that old man again?\n\n\u201cAnd that I will not go to Minna. Why should they be in a hurry. It isn\u2019t something urgent. Reconciliation and consensus arrangement can be achieved even lately on the elections ground on the day of election. Why the hurry? Our initial plan was to expand our consultations and make the consensus candidate even at national level before we realised that it isn\u2019t possible, even in our group let alone be at national level.\n\n\u201cBut they insisted we have to go to Minna and discuss the issue with Babangida. They were so in a hurry. And to our surprise, the consensus they agreed on yielded two candidates, the two of them not even one. That\u2019s an indication something fishy is going on, and I understand that already. Go and ask the three of them. We met on Wednesday and we agreed to bury the issue of consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cHow come Babangida and the Northern elders he invited would impose it on us after all we took ourselves to him, and we later withdrew,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut Saraki, through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyanu, described the report of the consensus as thorough and painstaking in reaching the decision.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cIt is a welcome development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent. One needs to commend and appreciate the elders, who worked to actualise the process.\n\n\u201cMay Allah bless them all. Their decision was based on equity, justice, and need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process, which can help the party later on. The process is a work-in-progress.\n\n\u201cOne person will still emerge from the on-going process here in the North. The South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East.\n\n\u201cA nation like Nigeria with all the current problems needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nMohammed, in a statement by his campaign spokesperson, Prof Udenta Udenta, said, \u201cOn Wednesday 20th April, 2022 Gen. Ibrahim Babangida GCFR, through the channel of the platform he inaugurated, announced Senator Bala Mohammed and Senator Bukola Saraki as the selected Consensus Aspirants.\n\n\u201cThe Senator Bala Mohammed Presidential Campaign Organisation will thus like to place on record its eternal gratitude to President Ibrahim Babangida, GCFR and the entirety of Northern Elders, who assisted him in reaching this decision.\n\n\u201cOur deep appreciation to them stems less from the fact that Senator Mohammed is among the two selected consensus aspirants and more on their Labour of thankless patriotic duty and uncommon leadership in attempting to bring order and coherence to bear in a condition of acute political uncertainty and fractured political process. We thank you our leaders from the depth of our heart.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached or lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a Consensus Presidential Aspirant. Rather, it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, RT Hon Aminu Tambuwal. Senator Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a Consensus Presidential Aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe above four named individuals not only initiated the Consensus Arrangement on their own volition but also agreed to fully and unequivocally abide by the decision that Gen Babangida will arrive at in consultation with other elders as well as accept, honour the steps and procedures he will deploy in arriving at any decision.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reject the current insinuations in the media from some quarters that purport that Gen Babangida and the elders either did not consult very widely or imposed a decision on an unwilling band of presidential aspirants. Gen Babangida and elders deserve nothing but commendation for the conclusions they reached and the outcome of the Consensus exercise by anybody, who believes in the tenets of truth, honour and integrity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the northern elders are scheduled to meet today in Asokoro, Abuja, to deliberate on the consensus report and the Wednesday planned NEC meeting of the PDP,\n\nBut the Arewa Youth, in a press statement by Suleiman Abubakar, the Director, Public Affairs, stated: \u201cAs we embark on the second phase of this critical assignment, the two aspirants chosen by our elders should work together with the support of other major stakeholders and decide on which of them should emerge as the sole consensus PDP northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe criteria used by the elders, revealed that the North-East in terms of zonal assessment have been considered as Governor Bala Mohammed was not the only individual from the zone, hence factors of equity, Justice and fairness should not be ignored in any attempt as we continue on this historic efforts.\n\n\u201cTo this end, with Bala Mohammed as northern consensus candidate, the rest of Nigerians will understand that as northerners, we have done justice to ourselves as Bala is a detribalised leader, who has been tested and trusted as former minister of the federal capital territory, an achiever per excellence as an incumbent governor of Bauchi state.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of readiness demonstrated by his Excellency, Bala Mohammed, since his endorsement by our elders to lead discussion with all other aspirants in the PDP with a view to having a national consensus if possible, is encouraging and this tells us that he is the man for the job, if we truly want to succeed,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauch",

          "text": "In furtherance of Operation Dakatar Da Barawo (OPDDB) that was launched to checkmate crude oil theft and related acts of economic sabotage, the Nigerian Navy said it seized 6, 000, 000 litres of stolen crude oil estimated at N264 billion.\n\nHowever, there were no report of seized barges and motherships by the Navy, unfortunately, that is where most of the thefts occur because these are the means by which stolen crude oil are being transported to international markets and sold at far below the market price. And sadly this is occurring right under the nose of the security agencies some of who the government has acknowledged collude with the the criminals to shortchange the country.\n\nFollowing the alarming increase of crude oil theft, the president had directed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, to ensure that the criminal activity was brought to a halt. Buhari\u2019s directive had followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOwing to the directive, the naval troops disclosed that they recorded more arrests and seizures between April 15th and 23rd, 2022, being the third week of the operation.\n\nA statement issued by Naval Headquarters stated that the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) DELTA in Warri, deactivated an Illegal Refining Site (IRS) around Sara creek.\n\nThe IRS had 16 ovens, 16 metal storage tanks and three wide pits filled with about 500,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, as well as 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil, a generator and 4 pumping machines.\n\nAlso, the statement revealed that an IRS at Asugbo creek in Warri was discovered with six ovens, 12 metal storage tanks and five large pits all containing about 600,000 litres of stolen crude oil including 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 150,000 litres of sludge.\n\nSimilarly, sequel to series of air reconnaissance, Forward Operating Base (FOB) FORMOSO in Bayelsa State on April 19, 2022, raided an IRS at Ereweibio creek in Brass LGA.\n\nAccordingly, seven large cooking ovens, 10 large metal storage tanks and drums all laden with about 400,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and 20,000 litres of suspected illegally refined PMS were discovered.\n\nThe site also had five large pits holding approximately 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil. Equally, two pumping machines, one gasoline generator, one submersible pump and one chainsaw machine were discovered at the site and destroyed in situ.\n\nAccording to the statement, on April 21, 2022, an IRS at Lelemu creek in Warri South-West was discovered. During the operation, 19 ovens, 26 metal storage tanks and two dugout pits laden with about 250,000 litres of suspected stolen crude oil and 50,000 litres of illegally refined AGO were destroyed.\n\nTo ensure effective deactivation of IRS, NNS DELTA on 21 April 2022 conducted swamp buggy operations during which an earlier identified IRS around Egwa creek in Warri was destroyed.\n\nDuring the operation, 16 ovens, 31 metal storage tanks and seven large pits all filled with about 850,000 litres of stolen crude oil were equally deactivated.\n\nRelatedly, on 22 April 2022, around Lelemu creek in Warri South West LGA of Delta State, personnel under NNS DELTA again discovered 22 IRS ovens, 12 metallic storage tanks and 5 large pits all containing about 150,000 litres of stolen crude oil.\n\n\u201cAt another IRS off Lelemu creek, 19 ovens, 42 storage tanks and 14 large pits containing about 300,000 litres of stolen crude oil, as well as approximately 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, 100,000 litres of illegally refined DPK and 100,000 litres of suspected crude oil sludge were all destroyed,\u201d it added.\n\nIn a related development, NNS LUGARD at Kogi State in the course of OPDDB discovered an IRS on 22 April 2022, at a location off Akili-Ozizor community of Ogbaru LGA, Anambra State.\n\nDuring the operation, four locally fabricated ovens, seven metal storage tanks, four large pits of which two were for storage of about 48,000 litres of stolen crude oil were all destroyed.\n\nOn the same day, NNS VICTORY in Calabar raided tanker garage along Harbour road in the city and seized a storage tank containing about 45,000 Litres of suspected illegally refined AGO. Also, a tanker laden with 33,000 Litres of suspected locally refined AGO was seized and the owner was arrested. Furthermore, about 58 drums of locally refined AGO were also seized.\n\nAdditionally, NNS SOROH at Yenagoa, on Saturday 23 April 2022 intercepted a wooden boat at Otuokpot Area along Kolo creek.\n\n\u201cThe wooden boat was laden with 60,000Litres of illegally refined AGO together with over 100 sacks of same product. Items on the boat which included one pumping machine, one Yamaha 40HP outboard engine and one locally made boat Anchor with the products were destroyed at Ogbia waterside,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe base also conducted a search on a Market Boat heading for St Nicolas Axis from Akassa area.\n\nAbout 2,500 litres of suspected illegally refined products stored in gallons and sacks were hidden inside the boat.

It is not going to be a do or die affair and it should not be.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ngige, called for unity among aspirants, adding that, \u201cIf anybody tells you that the way we are playing politics now is the best, it is not true. We have to do a rethink. We need unity, God knows who will take it\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, Bauchi state Governor, Bala Mohammed, described the gathering as historic, saying it was only the First Lady, \u201cthat could bring me here today.\u201d\n\nHe commended Mrs. Buhari for her motherly roles in uniting Nigerians, adding that \u201cbeing patient has made you to stand out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his ambition, Mohammed said, \u201cI am not saying I am the best, as some of the best are yet to come out. I assure you that I will make sure that we do our game of politicking putting Nigeria first.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, commended the First Lady for the well thought out program that attracted people of diverse political backgrounds, saying, \u201cit should be all about our nation and patriotism. We should put our nation above ourselves. This kind of gathering is going to douse hate speeches. We have to have Nigeria first. This will foster greater unity and put Nigeria first\u201d.\n\nAnother presidential aspirant, Tein Jack-Rich, urged the young people to join politics to turn around situations \u201cthat have held the nation captive, so that we can become voice for the voice less.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe destiny of Nigeria is in the hands of all Nigerians, but everything you do is in the hands of future Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe youths will not be used this time around to snatch ballot boxes this time.

I must stress the importance of the north-west zone. Kano, Kaduna and Katsina, if you want to succeed, come and talk to us in the north-west zone.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, described the gathering as another opportunity by the First Lady to display her motherly love and engender peaceful electioneering process ahead of the 2023 general elections\n\n\u201cWe are witness to your exemplary conduct, your large heart and endless display of love for mankind. We see you today, we see your love and like a mother, you have left no one behind. Nigerians are proud of you, the women are proud of you,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Special Adviser to the First Lady on Media, Mallam Sani Zorro, while describing Iftar, as an established tradition at the State House, said First Lady, is the First Lady of all Nigerians, not just the First Lady of the ruling party, therefore, \u201cthe need to host all aspirants across political parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Iftar is organised to provide opportunities for all aspirants to rub minds and promote the idea of permanent national interest especially in the eve of elections. It is used to forgive one another of both the intentional and unintentional mistakes,\u201d he added.",
