          "text": "Once the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), assent to the reworked Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill presently on his table, the Independent National Electoral Commission will be barred from receiving applications for registration of more political parties to participate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nSection 78 (1) of the current Electoral Act states that any political association that meets the requirements for registration as a political party shall be duly registered provided that such an application is submitted to INEC not later than six months before general elections.\n\nHowever, Clause 75 of the new electoral bill sent to the President for assent stipulates that application for registration must be submitted at least one year before a general election.\n\nClause 75(1) reads, \u201cAny political association that complies with the provisions of the constitution and this Act for the purposes of registration shall be registered as a political party: Provided, however, that such application for registration as a political party shall be duly submitted to the commission not later than 12 months before a general election.\n\nWith the Presidential and National Assembly elections fixed for February 18, 2023, it means that if the President signs the electoral bill, no association would be able to apply for registration as a political party from February 17, 2022.\n\nThe PUNCH had on December 26, 2021, exclusively reported that less than two years after the INEC deregistered 74 political parties due to their poor performance in the 2019 general elections, no fewer than 107 groups had approached the commission for registration as political parties.\n\nResponding to a Freedom of Information request sent by Sunday PUNCH, the Deputy Director, SERVICOM at INEC, Olayide Okuonghae, said between 2019 and December 14, 2021, about 101 political associations had applied for registration.\n\nThe bill, if signed into law, would not affect those who have already applied for registration.\n\nThe number of political parties in the country dropped to 18 when INEC deregistered the political parties.\n\nCurrently, there are 18 political parties in the country.\n\nINEC had on February 6, 2020, deregistered 74 political parties due to their poor performance in the 2019 general elections and the re-run elections that followed.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, said in addition to the extant provision for the registration of political parties, the Fourth Alteration to the Section 225(a) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, empowers the Commission to deregister political parties.\n\nDuring the 2019 general elections, 91 political parties participated in the exercise, while an additional party, Boot Party, was registered based on the order of a court after the election.\n\nHowever, the National Assembly has stripped INEC of the power to deregister parties especially based on not winning an election.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023 presidency: Group drums support for Adesina",
          "text": "Akinwumi Adesina\n\nSays he holds a new future for Nigeria\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nABUJA: Ahead of next year\u2019s general elections, a political pressure group, under the aegis of Youth Arise Movement, YAM, has endorsed the President of African Development Bank, AfDB, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina as possible replacement for President Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerian president.\n\nNigeria Publicity Secretary of YAM, Yusuf Omar Yusuf, said while speaking with Vanguard in an interview in Abuja, that, Dr. Adesina met all qualities needed to drive a new Nigeria.\n\nREAD ALSO: Reps summons NPA boss over $195m Deep Blue contract\n\nYusuf said the former Minister of Agriculture is globally known and respected development economist, with sound understanding of macroeconomic, fiscal, governance, sectoral and policy issues to drive faster pace development for Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, Adesina was an outstanding Minister of Agriculture in Nigeria, where he ended four decades of corruption in the fertilizer sector and ensured that farm inputs (seeds and fertilizers) got to farmers directly by sending farmers electronic vouchers for their subsidized seeds and fertilizers, by-passing corrupt government procurement systems.\n\n\u201cThis transformed food production in the country, providing 15 million farmers with farm inputs. Under him, Nigeria produced over 20 million metric tons of food. He is seen as the best Agriculture Minister in the history of the country.\n\n\u201cHe is a de-tribalized Nigerian. He is much loved and trusted in the North, where his programs as Minister of Agriculture transformed Northern Nigeria. He has bold and innovative ideas on solving the perennial herder-farmer challenges, for improving security in the country.\n\n\u201cHe will implement a bold vision to turn Northern Nigeria into a global power house in food and agriculture, to unleash wealth and reduce fragility and insecurity facing Northern Nigeria. \u201c\n\nThe group stressed further that Adesina \u201cWill manage Nigeria\u2019s multi-lingual, cultural and religious diversity very well. He has vast experience in managing cultural, ethnic and religious diversity.\n\n\u201cHe demonstrated this in Nigeria while he was Minister of Agriculture. He is doing the same at the African Development Bank, where he leads staff from 81 different countries from around the world, with diversity of religion, language and culture. He will be able to build trust and inclusiveness across the states and regions of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAdesina has deep experience and proven leadership to turn things around. At the African Development Bank, his innovative and bold programs \u2014 covering electricity, agriculture, industrialization, regional integration and improving the quality of life (including water and sanitation, youth and women) have impacted 335 million people in Africa in just five years.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs faster-paced development to deal with massive poverty and unemployment and insecurity. He will be able to make this happen fast for Nigeria, bringing in his vast experience.\u201d\n\nYusuf added that as well known for transparency and tackling corruption, \u201cThe AfDB President is a person of impeccable integrity. Under his leadership, the African Development Bank was ranked in 2021 as the 4th most transparent institution in the world.\n\n\u201cAlso, under his leadership, the African Development Bank was ranked in 2021 as the Best Multilateral Financial Institution in the world. He took an African institution and made it the best financial institution in the world.\n\n\u201cHe has extensive experience in driving private sector investments at scale. With his global experience in private sector investments, an excellent reputation for integrity, honesty, transparency and good governance, he will be able to raise the global profile and standing of Nigeria to attract private sector investments, while opening up trade and investment opportunities around the world, including the G-7 and G20 countries, as well as UK and Commonwealth countries.\n\n\u201cHis global leadership in world of global finance will dramatically help to open up space for the private sector to trigger greater financial flows into Nigeria. He already showed this for Africa. The Africa Investment Forum that he organized in 2018 and 2019 attracted global investors from around the world and mobilized over $78 Billion of investments in less than 72 hours.\n\n\u201cNigerians trust him. The youth trust him. The private sector trusts him. The financial industry trusts him. Farmers trust him. He is trusted in every region of the country. He has a great reputation all across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBy selecting him, the President Buhari will leave a lasting legacy for himself, Nigeria and Africa. Africa and the world trust Dr. Adesina. He has been named among the 100 most reputable people in the world.\n\n\u201cHe is well-respected by all African Heads of State and Government and will be able to work effectively with leaders in Africa. \u201c\n\nDr. Adesina the group noted speaks French fluently and has worked for decades in French-speaking countries, which will greatly enhance regional cooperation, integration, peace and security in Africa.",

Similarly, NAF jets bombarded one of the major bandits camp in Farar Doka, where over 43 bandits were eliminated. In Niger state, NAF airstrikes and military gunships destroyed bandits\u2019 camps, eliminating over 37 bandits including their leaders.\n\nAccording to the group, troops with the collaboration of civilian JTF while in another success, on fighting patrol neutralized scores of BokoHaram /ISWAP terrorists on Dunga Lawanti village near Gubio in Borno State.\n\n\u201cEarlier, weapons, motorcycles and other items were recovered from the insurgents. The Northern Youth Network profoundly appreciates the Nigerian military and particularly the Chief of Air Staff, Marshal, Isiaka Oladayo Amao. We celebrate the soldiers for taking the war to the enclaves of the terrorists\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nThe group further averred that as an association which has been involved in peace building in states ravaged by BokoHaram/ISWAP insurgents, the news of these successes is cheering and heart warming.\n\nIt commended the focus and determination of the military, most especially the Nigerian Airforce and gallant troops, who have decimated the terrorists within these weeks adding that the successes were novel, impressive and unprecedented and urged Nigerians to support the war against insurgency and banditry.\n\n\u201cWe rise to commend the Nigerian military. We particularly commend the air component for the sustained bombardment of terrorist enclaves and top commanders in the last 3 weeks. The Chief of Air Staff is appreciated for the heat turned on the insurgents with intensive air strikes. We celebrate the ground troops who support the air component by sustaining a fierce offensive on fleeing terrorists and bandits\u201d\n\nThe group, further tasked the military to sustain and intensify the heat on the terrorist until they are eliminated and peace restored to the affected states and regions in compliance with President Buhari\u2019s determination to hand over a peaceful country to his successor.\n\n\u201cAfter years of insurgency, peace has finally returned to Muna community in Borno State, Damasak market has been reopened and some major roads which were closed down have now been opened to traffic.

          "text": ".\n\n\n\n\u2026Urges Compensation for Damaged Cars\n\nThe National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has commended the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) on its handling of the scarcity of the petrol motor spirit (PMS) experienced across Nigeria in recent times.\n\nThe council also urged the nation\u2019s oil company to take a step further and compensate car owners whose vehicles were damaged by the contaminated product.\n\nThe NNPC had revealed that the scarcity was occasioned by the importation of adulterated fuel by suppliers.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Friday, in Abuja, NYCN president, Solomon Adodo explained that the council was satisfied with steps taken by the company to ensure free flow of uncontaminated products.\n\nComrade Adodo who addressed journalists after an emergency session of the leadership of the council said the umbrella youth body did set up a task force to ascertain the situation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. led by Mele Kyari immediately ordered the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck and marine) after it discovered the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/ Hyde/Ay Maikifi/Brittania- U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\n\u201cOur task force also found out that the NNPC also asked oil companies to embark on emergency supply of petrol to replace cargoes that were rejected as a result of their poor quality.\n\n\u201cThese remedial actions aimed at arresting the use of the contaminated fuel inadvertently disrupted the country\u2019s fuel supply chain and led to the damage of several cars.\n\n\u201cWe are satisfied with the prompt action taken by the federal government in order for a full investigation into the bad fuel that damaged engines of some vehicles.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we commend the transparency and full disclosure adopted by Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. under the leadership of Mallam Mele Kyari in getting to the root of the problem. Without a doubt, the decision of NNPC to order the quarantine of all unevacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel saved the nation from a monumental scandal.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, the decision of NNPC to order the quarantine of all unevacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel saved the nation from a monumental scandal. This is a welcome departure from the past when the activities of the oil giant were shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\u201cAlready, Mele Kyari in pursuit of the transparency regime of NNPC under his leadership disclosed that the cargoes quality certification at the loading port in Belgium by Am Spec Belgium indicated that the product complied with Nigerian specification but that petrol brought into Nigeria usually does not include the test for the level of methanol content.\n\n\u201cIn order to forestall future occurrence of importation of ethanol-blended fuel, a mechanism should be put in place to test the level of methanol content to make sure that it is in full compliance.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing investigation by the federal government must be transparent, holistic, far-reaching and targeted to prevent further occurrence. Government must impose punitive sanctions/ punishment on corporate entities found to be in breach of their mandate or liable for this scandal.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on the government to compensate Nigerians whose vehicle engines were damaged by the methanol blended fuel.\n\n\u201cWe call citizens not to engage in panic buying as NMDPRA has announced the arrival of 300million litres of fuel. This arrival will help resupply the nation\u2019s disrupted fuel chain and clear the queues being experienced at filling stations.\n\n\u201cThe scarcity of fuel that was experienced is not part of any secret plan of government to introduce full deregulation through the back door. The source of the problem has been identified and will be solved. The present administration has achieved so much in the petroleum industry and we are confident that it will do everything within its power to protect this legacy and pass it on to the incoming administration at the end of its tenure next year\u201d, Adodo added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Supreme Court has declared as unlawful and unconstitutional the Executive Order 10 (EO10) issued by President Muhammadu Buhari on the funding of State Judiciary and Legislature.\n\nIn a split decision on Friday, majority of the Court\u2019s seven-member panel agreed that the President exceeded his constitutional powers in issuing the EO10.\n\nSix out of the seven members of the panel proceeded to void and set aside the EO10.\n\nThe majority decision adopted the expert opinions supplied by Musibau Adetunbi (SAN) and Mahmud Magaji (SAN), two out of the five amici curiae invited by the court to advise it on the case.\n\nThe judgment, which was on the suit marked: SC/CV/655/2020 filed by the 36 State Governments against the Federal Government, decided two key issues: the constitutionality of the EO10 and the funding of superior courts in states by the Fed. Govt.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn declaring the EO10 unconstitutional, Justice Musa Dattijo Muhammad, in the lead majority judgment, said: \u201cThis country is still a federation and the 1999 Constitution it operates is a federal one.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution provides a clear delineation of powers between the state and the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe President has overstepped the limit of his constitutional powers by issuing the Executive Order 10. The country is run on the basis of the rule of law,\u201d Justice Mohammed said in the lead majority judgment.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Court remands three for allegedly robbing four people at gun point\n\nFive out of the seven Justices on the panel agreed with Justice Muhammad on this issue. They are: Justices Centus Nweze, Ejembi Eko, Helen Ogunwumiju, Emmanuel Agim and Adamu Jauro.\n\nOnly Justice Uwani Abba-Aji dissented on this issue and held that EO10 was lawful and constitutional.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are not unaware of the hanky-panky and subterfuge played by state governors against the independence and financial autonomy of state Judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is a pitiable eyesore what judicial officers and staff go through financially at the hands of state executives, who often flout constitutional and court orders to their whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cThus, the presidential Executive Order 10 is meant to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional provisions\u2026the Executive Order is to aid the states legislature and judiciary in curing the constitutional wrong of their financial autonomy, which the state have always denied. This is not unconstitutional,\u201d Abba-Aji said.\n\nOn the second issue, four members of the panel rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that it was the responsibility of the Fed Govt to fund both the capital and recurrent expenditures of the superior courts created for states under Section 6 of the Constitution.\n\nOn this issue, Justices Nweze, Ogunwumiju and Abba-Aji agreed with Justice Muhammad\u2019s lead majority judgment.\n\nThree members of the panel: Justices Ejembi Eko, Emmanuel Agim and Adamu Jaro gave a dissenting opinion, to the effect that it was the Fed Govt\u2019s responsibility to fund both the capital and recurrent expenditures of all courts created under Section 6 of the Constitution.\n\nJustice Eko, who authored the lead minority decision, said the money standing to the credit of the Judiciary on the Federation Account and Consolidated Revenue Fund Account should be applied to fund both the capital and recurrent expenditures of courts created under Section 6 of the Constitution.\n\nAll the seven members however rejected the request by the plaintiffs that the Federal Government be compelled to refund to them all that they have spent on the said courts in their states.\n\nThe court held that the states were not entitled to be refunded all they have spent before now to maintain those courts, which they put at N66billion.\n\nThe apex court said the plaintiffs failed to prove their entitlement to the refund they claimed.\n\nJustices Muhammad and Eko were absent at Friday\u2019s proceedings. Justice Muhammad\u2019s judgment was read by Justice Nweze, while Justice Agim read the judgment by Justice Eko.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja Ndubuisi Orji and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nAlmost two weeks after receiving the re-amended 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment ) Bill 2022 from the National Assembly, President Muhamnadu Buhari, appears to be in a fix on signing the document into law.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on National Assembly Matters (Senate ), Senator Babajide Omoworare, who spoke yesterday in Abuja, said the president was receiving consultations from the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and other stakeholders on the way forward for the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cA very crucial consultation is going on between Mr President, Attorney General and other critical stakeholders on the content of the bill for the required assent. If not for this programme, I am suppose to be at the very important meeting, believed to be the major determinant for the fate of the bill.\u201d\n\nHe, however, assured Nigerians that the bill would most likely be assented to by the president since issues earlier raised by him in the 2021 edition were elaborately addressed by both chambers of the National Assembly in January.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think in few days time, Mr President will do the needful since the most contentious aspect of the bill had been addressed in the reworked one transmitted to him on Monday, January 31, 2022. Time is of essence, but I believe that Mr President will do the needful,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the assurance given by Omoworare was not enough to douse the apprehension entertained by conveners of the dialogue who received message from the AGF that his planned consultation with President Buhari prevented him from coming .\n\nVirtually all the discussants at the policy dialogue, from former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega; Country Representative of Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Adebowale Olorunmola and Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Media, Benjamin Kalu, appealed to President Buhari to assent to the bill without further delay.\n\nJega in particular said no law or legislation is perfect, but that what was made available now by the lawmakers, is good and manageable for the coming elections.\n\nRepresentative of INEC at the discourse, Prof. Bolade Eyinla, said to avoid the problem of working on electoral laws at the tail end of conducting elections, INEC should be allowed to drive the process as is done in Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe situation at hand now is that roughly a year to the general election, the anticipated laws are not yet approved, meaning that the extant one will be used aside the fact that the process has not enabled INEC to come up with clear cut guidelines for conduct of the elections,\u201d he lamented.\n\nMeanwhile, the Transition Monitoring Group, (TMG), National Consultative Front (NCFront) and Middle Belt Forum (MBF), yesterday, expressed worry over President Buhari\u2019s delay to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThey wondered why the bill was still lying on the president\u2019s desk, about 10 days after the National Assembly reworked it to include the three primary options, including direct, indirect and consensus which President Buhari observed were not in the first bill transmitted to him.\n\nAuwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, Executive Director Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre( CISLAC) and Chairman Transition Monitoring Group, said President Buhari has proved himself to be untrustworthy by delaying assent to the bill after the lawmakers worked on the areas he pointed out.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari is just telling us that he doesn\u2019t care about the country and doesn\u2019t care about anybody. It is sad and unfortunate that a president who talks so much about integrity is challenging that integrity. Integrity is about honesty and being consistent. The president pointed out areas he wanted to be corrected before he signs the bill; those areas have been corrected and he is still delaying assent. This will really put the Independent National Electoral Commission in a difficult position to conduct the election.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the NCFront Convener and a former presidential adviser, Prof Pat Utomi, said the delay and claims that the president was consulting on the bill before he takes necessary action shows that something was amiss.\n\nPresident Buhari withheld assent to the amended bill initially transmitted to him in November 2021 and insisted that it restricted the mode for political parties to choose candidates for election to direct primary mode, which he said was undemocratic.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nUtomi, however, faulted the position of the president and noted that his understanding of democracy is that the president should consult the party and the people on issues that needed action.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu noted that it was too early to take a definite stand on why the assent is delayed as Buhari has 30 days to do so.\n\nBut, a lawyer and former president of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, said President Buhari is playing a power game and alleged an attempt by those who think they own Nigeria to manipulate the system.\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives has said that there was no selfish interest in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed by the National Assembly, recently.\n\nChairman, House Committee on Media and Publicity, Benjamin Kalu, stated this while fielding questions from journalists, yesterday, in Abuja.\n\nHe said the National Assembly will not lobby the Presidency to assent to the electoral act amendment bill, as that would amount to interfering with the function of the executive.\n\n\u201cWe are three arms of government. Though we are three, we are one government and it will be interfering within the parameters of our mandate not to allow them the independency as proposed by the constitution.\n\n\u201cThey should be allowed the free hand to make decisions based on what we have proffered as a reflection of the wishes, hunger and desire of the common Nigerians\n\n\u201c The executive should be able to trust the parliament enough to know that what we speak remains the voice of the people and not our own voices.\u201d\n\nKalu said the National Assembly was guided by public interest in enacting laws, and that the lawmakers had given Nigerians the electoral law they sought for.\n\n\u201cIn view of the dynamics of the society, challenges we have experienced, the 2010 electoral act is obsolete, and therefore, can no longer meet the demands, expectations, ethos and principles of democracy. If we are serious about advancing our democracy, we should stop playing to the gallery.\n\n\u201cWe should do what the public interest says. And what is the public interest? That they want the electoral act amendment bill, as submitted, having incorporated the direct, indirect and consensus. Let us move on and that\u2019s not selfish interest. That\u2019s public interest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever actions that we take, motions moved, resolution and bills that we make, we make not as unto ourselves to the exclusion of others, we make them to the generality of Nigerians because for now, we are members of the parliament. Who knows tomorrow, we might be in the executive or even be outside the government.\n\n\u201cThe laws we make today will be there to govern us in time to come as citizens of this country. So, the element of selfishness should be removed from our ideas on this particular piece of legislation.\n\n\u201cAll we have maintained, what has guided us is nothing but to increase transparency, accountability, competitiveness and fairness in our electoral system,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Buhari Talks Tough, Says Suppliers of Substandard Fuel would be Held Accountable",
          "text": "*Directs service providers to give information on consumed products\n\n*House wants companies involved suspended\n\n*Emadeb Consortium fights back, says NNPC\u2019s claims misleading\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Vanessa Obioha\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said suppliers of the methanol-blended petroleum products in the country were liable for the bad fuel and should be held accountable. Buhari directed relevant government agencies to take every lawful step to ensure the respect and protection of consumers against market abuse and social injustice.\n\nThe president was reacting to the saga of the adulterated petrol imported into the country, which was said to have damaged some vehicles. The withdrawal of the fuel is behind the recent petrol scarcity that has caused long fuel queues in some towns and cities across Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari said the protection of consumer interests was the priority of his administration. He said his government was ready to take necessary measures to protect consumers from hazardous products, loss or injuries from the consumption of substandard goods.\n\nThe president directed that in line with the law, service providers must make full disclosure of relevant information with respect to the consumption of their products. He said dissatisfied consumers were entitled to proper redress of their complaints.\n\nHowever, following the disclosure by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) that its investigation revealed the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil, the House of Representatives yesterday directed the national oil company to suspend the companies involved.\n\nThat was as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), also yesterday, called for an independent inquest into the matter. The main opposition party alleged that the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) was trying to provide cover for some of its leaders, reportedly, involved in importation of the bad fuel.\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) also said NNPC, as the sole importer of fuel in the country, should be responsible for payment of damages to affected Nigerians.\n\nBut Emadeb-consortium yesterday distanced itself from the bad fuel saga, saying listing it among those partly responsible for the importation of the off-specification petrol by the NNPC is misleading. The group in a statement in Abuja released by the Lead Consortium, Emadeb Energy Services Limited, urged NNPC to single out Brittania-U, an initial member of the coalition, which opted out of the arrangement instead of lump everyone in the consortium together.\n\nThe House of Representatives also mandated its committee on petroleum downstream to investigate the release of adulterated petroleum in the country with a view to ensuring that the culprits were brought to book and recommendations made to avoid future reoccurrence.\n\nThe Downstream Committee of the House was also mandated to ascertain whether the importation, distribution and dispensing of the toxic petrol in Nigeria till date conformed to the international standard.\n\nMembers of the committee where further mandated to find out the roles played, if any, by NNPC, the Standard Organisation of Nigeria, the Directorate of Petroleum Resources, Nigerian Navy, Customs, limited liability companies, and, perhaps, individuals in respect of the incident and report back to the House within four weeks for further legislative action.\n\nThe resolutions were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance, sponsored by Chief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno (APC, Borno).\n\nMonguno, moving the motion, noted that the country recently witnessed scarcity of fuel in petrol stations, especially in the Federal Capital Territory and Lagos State, due to the withdrawal of fuel with high methanol content. He said the House was aware that the fuel quality was noticed about a week ago when car engines of a lot of motorists were, reportedly, damaged and consumers had already started suing retail outlets for selling the adulterated fuel.\n\nMonguno lamented that as a result of actions or inactions over the years, Nigeria, known to be a petroleum producing country, has now outsourced the refining of petroleum products to jurisdictions outside the country.\n\nWhile noting that the situation was embarrassing, the chief whip said the incident further reinforced the widespread clamour that petroleum government refineries in the country should be revamped so that the ugly scenario won\u2019t happen again.\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Magaji Da\u2019u (APC, Jigawa) was of the view that for the incident to happen, it meant the system was compromised, stressing that \u201cheads will roll.\u201d\n\nDeputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu (PDP, Enugu) said it appeared the parliament had been hired by NNPC to work for it.\n\nOn her part, Hon. Taiwo Oluga (APC, Osun), wondered what NNPC had done since the matter was reported.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Hon. Mshelia Haruna (APC, Borno), advised that citizens whose vehicles were affected should be considered during the investigation and recommendations.\n\nPDP Demands Independent Inquest\n\nPDP demanded investigation into allegations that APC leaders connived with foreign interests to import the fuel laden with methanol, \u201cin their desperation to defraud Nigerians and corruptly raise billions of naira to fund the APC National Convention and rigging of the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nThe main opposition party further alleged that with President Muhammadu Buhari as Minister of Petroleum, it would be impossible to achieve results without an independent inquest, else it would end like the #EndSARS inquiry.\n\nIn a statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, the party said it was now clear that APC leaders were desperately seeking ways to steal money to fund their 2023 rigging scheme, \u201csince the PDP and well-meaning Nigerians exposed and challenged their plots to siphon a staggering N2.557 trillion padded as fuel subsidy for 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPDP strongly condemned these despicable acts by APC leaders, which further expose the impunity and wickedness of the APC towards Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe inclination for official concealment ostensibly informed the refusal by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, on national television on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, to name those involved in the importation of the poisonous fuel into our country.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, the PDP rejects the announced internal investigation of this terrible crime by the government, as the APC administration cannot be trusted, given its manifest predilection to shield the APC leaders involved.\n\n\u201cNigerians note the various investigations instituted by the APC government in the past, which ended without any meaningful outcome; notable among which was the manipulated EndSARS Report.\u201d\n\nThe PDP demanded, \u201cAn Independent Commission of Enquiry to investigate all issues connected to the APC toxic fuel importgate.\u201d It maintained that those involved must be exposed and held accountable.\n\nIt further stated, \u201cOur party insists that President Muhammadu Buhari, as the Minister of Petroleum Resources, cannot acquit himself with his reported comedy of anger, buck-passing, querying of subordinates and attempt by government to use some companies as scapegoats instead of accepting responsibility by exposing and naming individuals involved in the crime.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the APC must explain how the reported 317 million litres of toxic fuel came into our country, got cleared and distributed across the nation to worsen the life-discounting experiences of millions of Nigerians under the APC administration.\n\n\u201cApart from the consequential economic hardship occasioned by the damaging of cars and equipment, crippling of means of livelihood across the country, as well as increase in the cost of food items and essential services, the cascading effect of adulterated fuel on our aviation industry can only be imagined.\n\n\u201cSadly, the situation has the possibility to trigger loss of confidence by international airlines in our aviation fuel supply with attendant economic downturn as they would more likely prefer to fuel in neighbouring countries.\u201d\n\nNNPC Responsible for Payment of Damages to Affected Nigerians, Says IPMAN\n\nSecretary of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Ismail Osatuyi, who spoke yesterday, while featuring on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Arise News Channel, said the NNPC and its agents must go back to the drawing board and make sure things were done well.\n\nOsatuyi stated, \u201cif you are cooking a soup and you put too much salt, definitely you can\u2019t eat it. This is the scenario we are seeing now.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians whose cars were destroyed by the product had rights to take legal action.\n\nOsatuyi added, \u201cThe buyers \u2013 Nigerians that had their vehicles spoiled \u2013 have the right to take legal action. And we have told our members that we have to know who and who are affected, which stations, which companies, so that we can also pass the information to the government.\n\n\u201cSince we are not responsible for the importation, then there must be restitution and that is the fact. And the government has to come in this time around for them to mitigate whatever damage they have done to the vehicle of Nigerians\u2019 and individuals.\u201d\n\nAsked if IPMAN would sue NNPC or its agents, Osatuyi stressed that the association would rather engage NNPC in dialogue.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWe are not going to sue the government on this issue, but we are going to collate data of affected stations and what it could cost us and pass it to the authority.\n\n\u201cWe are going to engage in dialogue so that we don\u2019t add to the problem. This has already happened and they are trying to mitigate the problem.\u201d\n\nOsatuyi pointed out that if the country\u2019s four refineries were working, such an issue would not have occurred.\n\nAsked if he was confident that NNPC would reimburse IPMAN members in anyway or bear the cost, Osatuyi said the government agency had no choice than to compensate them, otherwise the association would take legal action.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThey have no choice this time around. These are facts and figures. It is only when we engage them in discussion and say these are the figures, these are the facts, and they are trying to be funny, then we can now look at what we can do within the ambit of the law.\u201d\n\nEmadeb Denies Involvement, Says Brittania-U Should Be Held Responsible\n\nEmadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi stated that in several communications, it had notified NNPC of the decision of Brittania-U not to abide by the consortium\u2019s agreement, leading to deal that other members would not be liable for damages incurred by the company in the course of operations.\n\nThe consortium stated that NNPC was aware of the refusal of Brittania-U to cooperate with other members by way of making information available when needed.\n\nThe Emadeb statement stressed that the information released by NNPC did not exactly represent what transpired.\n\nIt stated, \u201cWe refer to the press release of February 9, 2022 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited on the issue of contaminated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) with higher concentrates of methanol, allegedly, imported by Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium.\n\n\u201cWe hereby state that the said importation of the contaminated PMS was executed by a member of the consortium, to wit: Brittania-U.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the blanket claims made against the consortium by the NNPC are misleading and contradict the actual events that happened; they do not fully reflect and/or represent what transpired.\u201d\n\nThe consortium stated that the clarifications relating to the delivery of the said contaminated petrol to the country were necessary to protect their image, as they had invested a lot in building each member\u2019s respective brands in the industry.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cBrittania-U Nigeria Limited (Brittania-U) was the sole supplier of the 90,000MT of PMS delivered via MT Torm Hilde with laycan January 2 to 4, 2022.\n\n\u201cAt the formation of the consortium in May 2021 by NNPC, Brittania-U refused to execute the Service and Consortium Agreement submitted to NNPC in fulfilment of the award of the DSDP contract.\u201d\n\nEmadeb stated that as the lead of the consortium, it engaged Brittania-U severally and the company insisted on dealing with NNPC independently of which the national oil company was expressly notified via a letter dated June 2, 2021.\n\nFurther, the consortium stated that Brittania-U vehemently refused to execute the Consortium Agreement with the other consortium members \u2013 Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi- saying it became surprising and frustrating to everyone.\n\nIt stated, \u201cBrittania-U communicated all her actions to the other consortium members and NNPC harping on the following points: Brittania-U\u2019s preference to perform a sole contract for crude lifting and PMS supply under the DSDP arrangement.\n\n\u201cBrittania-U\u2019s choice to be solely liable under her supplies to NNPC and in the light of which she indemnified the other consortium members accordingly.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the alleged culprit further refused the nominated international partner agreed by other consortium members \u2013 Emadeb/Hyde/ Ay Maikifi.\n\nEmadeb stated that Brittania-U failed to cooperate or share information and documents with the other consortium members in respect of the December 2021 crude cargo allocated to her by NNPC.\n\nIt further stated that following the repeated refusal of Brittania-U to work with the consortium, it indemnified the other consortium members\u2013Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi and the resulting agreement was executed by their company on June 16, 2021.\n\nThe indemnity clause, the consortium said, covered Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi against all damages, losses, costs and expenses.\n\nIt noted that this also included reasonable legal costs, expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees and liabilities incident to claims, demands or causes of action brought by or on behalf of any person or entity as result of the performance of or failure to perform the project.\n\n\u201cThe indemnity also covers shortages in delivery of products, late deliveries, delivery of off-spec cargo or other wrongful performance of their obligations in the DSDP agreement,\u201d Emadeb insisted.\n\nThe consortium via a letter dated December 10, 2021 said it informed NNPC of non-receipt of information from Brittania-U on all correspondence relating to the DSDP crude cargo allocated to them.\n\nIn addition, it said that it stated that Brittania-U\u2019s action contradicted all efforts to ensure performance on her allotted crude cargo.\n\nThe statement sad, \u201cIn view of the notice of the contaminated product, Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi immediately notified Brittania-U via a letter dated February 3, 2022 and also expressly informed NNPC of the sole liability of Brittania U.\n\n\u201cBased on the substantial evidence provided to NNPC and several declarations by Brittania-U to NNPC, Brittania-U is therefore solely liable for the supply of the PMS via MT Torm Hilde.\n\n\u201cThis is also demonstrated by their unwillingness to be part of the consortium; however, all the other parties were duly indemnified by Brittania-U.\n\n\u201cThe other consortium members \u2013 Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi had performed and delivered 270,000MT of PMS in the last five months and they were certified by the NNPC-nominated inspector without any complaint or adverse issues.\n\n\u201cOut of the 270,000MT of PMS, 90,000MT is currently discharging via MT Fair Seas offshore Lagos. All records showing our performance are available with NNPC for verification and validation.\u201d\n\nThe consortium stated that it would continue to work with NNPC and perform creditably on all its obligations, positing that as reputable companies, they will not associate themselves with any activity that will be to the detriment of the citizens of the country.\n\nIt said, \u201cEmadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi believe that these stated positions of ours have demonstrated that we are not the suppliers of the said contaminated PMS.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to give our full and maximum cooperation to any government investigation panel and or any agency with all the relevant documentation and or information that maybe required.\n\n\u201cWe implore all our customers to continue to patronise all services provided by Emadeb/Hyde and Ay Maikifi.\u201d\n\nOando Denies Involvement in Saga\n\nOando issued a rejoinder denying involvement in the methanol petrol affair. Company Secretary, Ayotola Jagun, signed the response, dated February 10.\n\nIt stated, \u201cFollowing media reports listing Oando as one of four importers that supplied methanol-blended Premium Motor Spirits (PMS) into the country, we hereby state that Oando did not import and supply PMS that was adulterated or substandard.

          "title": "IMF: Nigeria\u2019s Debt Sustainability at Risk, Cause for Concern",
          "text": "Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability is at risk and causes a great deal of concern and unease in the long-term. IMF reiterated the need for the Nigeria government to implement timely fiscal reforms.\n\nIMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, said these yesterday, during a virtual media briefing on its Nigeria\u2019s 2021 Article IV Consultation Staff Report.\n\nRahman noted that the increase in public debt had grown rapidly in 10 years and was approaching a time when the country would spend all its income on servicing debts. She stressed the need for urgent fiscal reforms.\n\nRahman explained, \u201cBut what we should remember here and the things that make Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability at risk are the following: we have seen a rapid rise in public debt in the last 10 years or so and this is being driven by fiscal deficits.\n\n\u201cSo, the dynamics is not that great. And there are a couple of other points that we should remember; which is that Nigeria\u2019s debt carrying capacity is very low. For us, revenue levels are low comparing to a typical emerging market country that spends less than 10 per cent of revenues on interest payments.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria\u2019s case, that ratio, if you just take federal government, it\u2019s over 80 per cent of revenues, if you take the consolidated, it is around a third, but the federal government is responsible for paying this debt service. So that\u2019s one point.\n\n\u201cThe second point is on the access side. Market access for Nigeria, that is international market access, like Eurobond, etc., is highly dependent on what happens to oil prices, more so than some other commodity exporters and oil exporters. So that makes Nigeria quite vulnerable.\u201d\n\nRahman said going forward, IMF projected for Nigeria a continuous increase in public debt.\n\n\u201cSo, we are projecting you will see public debt to go up from 36 per cent of GDP to close to 43 per cent of GDP in the medium term,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, it is increasing and it is reaching that level where you should be concerned, everybody should be concerned,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cNigeria has favourable dynamics in the sense that high inflation and low interest rates are keeping these dynamics in favour of Nigeria, right. But if that were to change because growth rates are not high, you could see public debt growing up very fast.\u201d\n\nResponding to a THISDAY inquiry on the impact fuel subsidy removal and value added tax (VAT) would have the masses, Rahman explained that tax reforms were a necessity to boost the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nShe also restated the need for the federal government to remove fuel subsidy, saying it is costly and regressive.\n\nRahman stated, \u201cA country that has little fiscal space to have a subsidy that benefits mostly the rich doesn\u2019t make sense. So, there are economic and social grounds for removing this subsidy.\n\n\u201cOf course, will it impact the poor because it\u2019s a universal subsidy it affects the poor, too. So, removing subsidy would have impact on poverty.\u201d\n\nThe IMF official added, \u201cAnd if you look at Nigeria\u2019s past attempts to remove fuel subsidies, it has always been difficult. But it would be important that in addition to having social assistance, targeted social assistance for the vulnerable and the poor and it also will need strong political will and a well-designed public campaign to demonstrate the merits of this reform and a full transparency in the use of resources. Without this important reform there is risk of reversal again.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Again, apex bank extends 5% concessionary interest on intervention loans by one year\n\n*Plans to end FX sale to banks by year-end\n\n* Diaspora remittances improve to $100m weekly\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday announced a new programme to stimulate the country\u2019s non-oil exports and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three to five years.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme, code-named, \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme),\u201d which takes immediate effect, consists of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.\n\nHe added that the initiative was a product of consultation with the banking community.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja, the CBN governor also announced further extension of all the central bank\u2019s concessionary five per cent interest rate on its intervention facilities till March 1, 2023.\n\nThe CBN had in January 2021, approved an extension on all its facilities by 12 months to March 2022, from the earlier March 2021 expiration date, against the backdrop of the dangers posed by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic businesses.\n\nThe concessions were provided during the first wave of the pandemic as part of measures to cushion its impact on businesses and economy.\n\nThis was as Emefiele further hinted that the central bank may end the sale of FX to banks for the purpose of funding their export bills, adding that the banks would be rather encouraged to generate their export revenue and proceeds.\n\nHe, however, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities\u2019 expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal as well as Biannual non-oil export summit.\n\nEssentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy in FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country\u2019s four major sources of FX inflow namely: proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\u201d\n\nHe said though the $200 billion FX proceeds target appeared unattainable to some, \u201cBut I am resolute and determined that we can achieve it.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor added: \u201cMany countries that are much less endowed than Nigeria are doing it. Consider for example that agriculture exports alone from the Netherlands was about $120 billion last year.\n\n\u201cYet, Netherlands has a land mass of about 42,000 square kilometers, which is much smaller than the land mass of Niger State alone, at over 76,000 square kilometers.\u201d\n\nHe said while the RT200 Programme was not intended to be a silver bullet to all the challenges in the export segment, it remained a first step meant to ensure that the CBN was able to carry out its mandate in an effective and efficient manner, which guarantees preservation of the scarce commonwealth, and the stability of the naira.\n\nEmefiele insisted that, \u201cIt is only by boosting productive and earning capacity of this economy that we can truly preserve the long-term value of our currency, as well as the stability of our exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, while justifying the extension of the concessionary loans, said the impact of the intervention measures helped the country make the fastest recovery from recession ever recorded and changed the trajectory of inflation to an eight-month downward spiral.\n\nHe noted that although interest rates on the CBN\u2019s various intervention facilities were expected to revert to nine per cent effective March 1, 2022, it has been extended to March, 2023.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cWe are announcing that the rates would remain at five per cent for another year in view of the promising trajectory we have established in economic growth and job creation. In effect, the concessionary interest rate of five per cent on our intervention facilities would now be extended until March 1, 2023.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed that the policies and measures adopted by the bank led to a significant improvement in diaspora inflow from an average of $6 million per week in December 2020, to an average of over $100 million per week by January 2022.\n\nCommenting further on plans by the central bank to limit FX sales to banks for exports activities, Emefiele said: \u201cThe banks don\u2019t have a choice, and I said so this morning in the meeting,\n\n\u201cI said the era is coming to an end because when your customers need $100 million, $200 million foreign exchange demand, and so you want to pack all the dollar and pass it to CBN to give you dollar \u2013 that era is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI have told them at the meeting before, that latest end of this year, we would tell them don\u2019t call the central bank for FX again, rather go and generate your export revenue and proceeds.\n\n\u201cFund people who want to generate export proceeds, when those export proceeds come, we would fund them at five per cent for you and they would earn rebate and that\u2019s how we can help you.\n\n\u201cThen, when these proceeds come, sell them to your customers that want $100 million or $200 million. That you will continue to come to central bank to give you dollar, we would stop it. The banks don\u2019t have a choice because it is their bread and butter, right?\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Conveners of a meeting of 100 leading business, political, civil society, and thought leaders, which held last week in Lagos, yesterday explained that the gathering should not be linked to the 2023 presidential election but a platform to chat a new consensus for national rebirth.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the coordinators of the group, Chairman of THISDAY/Arise Media Group, Nduka Obaigbena, and former Presidential Liaison Officer to the Senate, Kashim Imam, the eminent persons noted that the gathering was meant to build consensus towards national rebirth.\n\nThe meeting, which held from February 4 to 6 under the aegis of \u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d, the conveners pointed out, remained non- partisan. They said the retreat to chart a new consensus for national rebirth was attended by 14 incumbent governors, 13 former governors, and three former senate presidents.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d conveners stated, \u201cWhilst the 2022 committee is interested in the quality of leadership that will emerge in Nigeria at all levels, we consider attempts to link the committee with candidates or political parties for the 2023 elections as an unwarranted and unnecessary distraction.

          "text": "\u2022Explains why inspectors did not detect bad petrol before circulation\n\n\u2022National oil company requests emergency supply\n\n\u2022NMDPRA says nation has 10-day reserve deficit, announces arrival of 300m litres of fuel\n\n\u2022Assures queues to disappear by Friday\n\n\u2022FG orders investigation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Company Limited (NNPC) yesterday stated that its investigation has revealed the presence of Methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\nGroup Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, who disclosed this during a media briefing yesterday, however said he has since ordered the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\nIt was also gathered yesterday that the NNPC has asked oil trading firms to embark on emergency supply of petrol to replace cargoes that were rejected because of their poor quality, Reuters quoted two sources as having disclosed yesterday.\n\nApparently disturbed by the development, the federal government yesterday ordered investigation into the bad fuel that had damaged the engines of some vehicles.\n\nIn addition to disrupting the country\u2019s fuel supply chain, the product which led to the damage of several cars, the NNPC disclosed, was imported from Antwerp in Belgium.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja, Kyari, argued that petrol brought into Nigeria usually does not include the test for the level of methanol content.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman maintained that cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\n\u201cAs a standard practice for all PMS import to Nigeria, the cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has met Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for per cent of methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari disclosed that the NNPC had ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel that led to the disruption of the petrol distribution value chain, in order to prevent further distribution.\n\nHe stressed that the NNPC and other stakeholders were making serious efforts to resolve issues generated by the supply and discharge of methanol blended product in some Nigerian depots.\n\nKyari noted that the NNPC first received a report on January 20, 2022, from its quality inspector of the presence of \u201cemulsion particles\u201d in petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from the European country.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn order to prevent the distribution of the petrol, we have ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\n\u201cAll defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions and NNPC will work with the authority to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\n\u201cNNPC wishes to reassure Nigerians that we are currently sourcing additional cargoes to ensure product sufficiency.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has ordered that all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine), should be withheld.\n\nBut the NNPC GMD\u2019s explanation ran contrary to an earlier press statement released by MRS, where the company denied culpability.\n\nIn its statement MRS had stated that it remains a responsible corporate citizen and will not be involved in the purchase, importation, distribution or marketing of substandard petroleum products in the country, coming short of directly accusing the NNPC of complicity.\n\n\u201cDue to current subsidy regime, NNPC is the sole supplier of all PMS in Nigeria. Consequently, the NNPC through their trading arm Duke Oil, supplied a cargo of PMS purchased from international trader Litasco and delivered it with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. This vessel discharged in Apapa between the 24th and 30th of January, 2022,\u201d it had alleged.\n\nAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS said it received the product in its depot and distributed the product to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\nThe company described the allegation trending at the time as mischievous, false and untrue.\n\nBut the NNPC boss maintained that the methanol blended petrol was imported into the country by the suppliers, including MRS, through its Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase arrangement.\n\nThe arrangement allows the national oil company to deliver monthly crude oil lifting on Free on Board (FOB) basis to suppliers who in return are supposed to deliver petroleum products of Nigerian standard specification to NNPC.\n\nThe petroleum products delivered are usually equivalent in value to the crude oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions as advised.\n\nBut according to the NNPC, the companies that supplied the methanol blended petrol included MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer.\n\nHe said while Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium brought in the fuel through a vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando allegedly brought in the product through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil came through MT Nord Gainer vessel.\n\nFuel queues had been building in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, due to fuel shortages caused by the withdrawal of the contaminated petrol from the market. But NNPC was said to be seeking thousands of tonnes of the product to ameliorate the situation, the report said.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had said it found fuel with methanol above national specifications in the supply chain and removed the fuel from circulation. Although methanol, in small amounts, is a regular gasoline additive, the regulator said the supplier of the off-specification gasoline was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNigeria depends almost entirely on imports to meet its domestic fuel needs after many failed attempts to revamp the dilapidated refineries, with daily consumption exceeding 60 million litres.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium receives 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total about 320,000 bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nNigerians feel that cheap fuel is one of the few benefits the average Nigerian gets from the government, which sets price caps at the pump through a controversial and patchy subsidy scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, yesterday stated that NNPC had received delivery of 300 million litres of petrol to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos, when he met with marketers in a bid to raise distribution and remove the substandard fuel from supply chain, Ahmed said the 300 million litres arrived through six vessels ordered by NNPC. He noted that with the latest delivery, the fuel queues being witnessed in the country should disappear by Friday.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cToday, I am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days, ordered by the NNPC, carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres, just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ahmed disclosed that there was a 9,000-metric tonne vessel that was being discharged at the Apapa Port to major marketers, including OVH, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, Conoil, and Ardova Plc.\n\nAccording to him, as soon as the vessels complete discharging and start pushing products to oil marketers, the fuel queues in Lagos should fully disappear by Friday.\n\n\u201cSo, once these vessels complete discharging and start pushing the products to marketers, I believe Lagos will be cleared by Friday,\u201d Ahmed stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have got that assurance from the marketers. Also, most of these vessels will be providing volumes to most of the key members of DAPPMAN.\u201d\n\nBut the NMDPRA boss stated that the country currently had petrol that could last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency is 30 but this happened because of the concern that made us withdraw the vessels, which created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days, according to the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also on-going in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products; so, there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory agency said it was also working to address the challenge thrown up by the importation of substandard petrol into the country.\n\nOther attendees at the meeting included top officials of NNPC, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), and members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\n\nFG Orders Investigation\n\nBriefing newsmen at Abuja, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said government had initiated moves to investigate the supply and circulation of adulterated petrol in the country. Sylva said the federal government wanted to get to the root of the matter, and warned against hasty conclusions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to draw any conclusions yet,\u201d the former Bayelsa State governor said. \u201cThere will be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let us really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister assured that the government would consider compensating those who might have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked whether the issue was discussed at the FEC meeting and whether the suppliers would be punished, Sylva said, \u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but, of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and the NNPC is up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to the NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we are actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nMRS had in a newspaper advertorial yesterday said Duke Oil supplied a cargo of the adulterated petrol, which it purchased from an international trader, Litasco, and delivered with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. MRS further stated the vessel was discharged in Apapa, Lagos, between January 24 and 30, 2022, explaining that major marketers received the following quantities: OVH \u2013 10,000mt; MRS \u2013 5,000mt; NIPCO \u2013 5,958mt; ARDOVA \u2013 6,000mt; and TOTAL \u2013 10,000mt\n\nSylva also spoke on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC okayed the contract for the construction of the 17-storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that in 2020, Mr. President already commissioned that project. There were some ancillary works that had to be done to connect some of the buildings and that was now presented to council for the sum of N1.817 billion and this now closes out this contract and we have told the contractor. This is the full and final payment for everything.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the end of this project and we have completely delivered this to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) engaged the services of the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) to ensure uninterrupted distribution of petroleum products and maintain sanity in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIPMAN President, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo, who disclosed this to journalists yesterday said the strategy would weaken the threat by the National Association of Transport Owners (NARTO), which recently issued a threat to embark on industrial action.\n\nOkoronkwo said IPMAN was not part of any trade association and would not embark on industrial action to further compound the predicament faced by Nigerians. He said members were already heavily indebted to banks and could not afford to stagnate their businesses, adding that already, many have shut down operations as a result of harsh operating environment.\n\nThe president said IPMAN was ready to confront the excesses of the NARTO and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), who he alleged illegally fleeced marketers.\n\nOkoronkwo stated, \u201cThey are not registered under oil and gas, but as dry dock. But today they are gradually redefining operations of marketers who have signed bulk purchase arrangement with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe have lost over N27 billion over time from illegal fees they collect from marketers. They collect about N45,000 per truck and taking in millions that ought to be part of our margins and are building stations and purchasing trucks at the expense of duly licensed marketers.\u201d\n\nOkoronkwo raised concern about the dwindling margins of marketers and the heavy debts hanging on the necks of IPMAN members.\n\n\u201cThe products we purchased with N1 million in the past is now about N7 million without additional margin to operators,\u201d he said.\n\nNARTO had threatened to stop haulage of petroleum products across the country over the hike in the price of diesel to N430 per litre and other operational challenges. The association had earlier decried the delay in the payment of about N45 billion bridging cost, and demanded an increase in the transportation allowance factored into the pump price of petrol.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Community Residents In South-East Nigeria, Others Desert Homes Over Rise In Ritual Killings",
          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich.

          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich. It is sad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSpokespersons for the police in Abia and Anambra states, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Ikenga Tochukwu, when contacted by SaharaReporters on Thursday, said that the cases will be looked into and appropriate measures would be taken to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives called for the declaration of a national emergency of the rising cases of ritual killings across Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Mr Toby Okechukwu, moved the motion during plenary at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHe and his colleagues urged the National Orientation Agency and other stakeholders in the society to embark on vigorous campaigns to open the eyes of members of the public especially youths to the evils of ritual killings for money.\n\n\n\nBut according to a Lagos-based sociologist, Nike Adetutu, tackling this dangerous trend in Nigeria will also require the return to core morals and values in society.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, training and monitoring at the family level has broken down and that is why there are young people with misplaced priorities and poor orientation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"We must go back to the family system, where everything starts, we have failed in that area as a society.\n\n\n\n\"Parents are no longer giving the right training and monitoring to their children and that is why many of them have gone astray.\n\n\n\n\"The return to core morals and values will save us from all these problems.

          "text": "First, the hard facts and undisputable sequence regarding this important issue of national security interest and presidential information keeping of viatl records in order to serve the public interest and further understand the historical contexts of contemporary American presidencies.\n\nThe United States of America and many other intelligent and properly focused countries keep and learn from the presidential records of those who led the country.\n\nIn fact, there is a law, the Presidential Records Act, which assigned an independent agency the task of keeping these documents. It is called the National Archives and Records Administration. The Republican Ronald Reagan presidency (1981 to 1989) became the first presidency to deal with the protocols, requests and transmission of such information to the National Archives.\n\nBut the 45th President of the United States Donald J. Trump is a different man who creates and acts on terms and levels of his own assortment of idiosyncratic and giddy whims and preferences. You can count on Trump to set MAGAesque disruptions of the norms. He took some of the records with him, before and upon losing the election to Joe Biden. That is, before moving out of the White House.\n\nSo, in almost 44 years of its administration of presidential records no other U.S president has been more decisive in violating, disobeying and disregarding the protocols and necessary timely submissions of information and records than Trump!\n\nIn January 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved 15 boxes of documents and relevant items from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home.\n\nIn a polite rebuke, the National Archives and Records Administration underscored the point, in its statement that \u201cthese records should have been transferred to NARA from the White House at the end of the Trump Administration in January 2021\u2026.\u201d The respected Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero noted that the \u201cPresidential Records Act is critical to our democracy, in which the government is held accountable by the people\u2026.. Whether through the creation of adequate and proper documentation, sound records management practices, the preservation of records, or the timely transfer of them to the National Archives at the end of an Administration, there should be no question as to need for both diligence and vigilance. Records matter.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe New York Times award-winning correspondent Maggie Haberman\u2019s forthcoming book, \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America\u201d is reporting that while Trump was in office, the White House residence toilet was periodically clogged by printed paper \u2014- which she and the staff assumed that the President had\u2026.\n\nTrump has denied it.\n\n\n\nIF Maggie is accurate in this reporting for her book which will go on sale in October 2022, it will be ironical that some of the presidential records of Trump were being \u201cdumped\u201d to familiar imagery of that \u201cshxthxlx\u201d category (an alleged derogattion he labeled African countries) while he we was President.\n\nThe most important point is that he unlawfully took and transported the records of his presidency that should go to the designated government agency and kept them in his golfing, private residence in Florida.\n\nFundamentally, the man who as president instigated that lawless insurrection of January 6, 2021 against the legislative temples of American democracy, the sitting Congress, has since and before that day of infamy and mobocracy continued in his wilful disregard for the law and precedence and protocol by taking critical materials and documents that were marked, clearly, as \u201cclassified\u201d and security issues to his Private residence!\n\nAs I write this commentary on Thursday February 10, 2022, most of those documents were retrieved, obviously, against his unlawful preference. Trump and his enablers are still keeping several of those.\n\n\n\nAgain, Trump had his opportunity for greatness but his mind is driven by the heathen gods of small matters and petty conquests. But in America no one is the law; and no one is above the law! What a terrible beauty, Trump\u2019s America\u2026.\n\n*Dr. Chido Nwangwu, the author of the forthcoming 2022 book, MLK, Mandela & Achebe: Power, Leadership and Identity, serves as Founder & Publisher of the first African-owned, U.S-based newspaper on the internet, USAfricaonline.com, and established USAfrica in 1992 in Houston. He has appeared as an analyst on CNN, SKYnews, VOA, BET news, SABC, and served as an adviser on Africa business to Houston\u2019s former Mayor Lee Brown. @Chido247",

          "title": "11 African startups to watch out for in 2022",
          "text": "It\u2019s safe to say the Africa startup ecosystem came full circle last year with a record-breaking number of new innovative startups and huge investment to match it. If innovation is a reflection of economic, social, and technological advancement, then we can say the ecosystem has advanced.\n\nSo, out of hundreds of excellent startups in Africa, we have curated 10 that we think you, our readers, should watch closely as we expect them to do some incredible stuff this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFintech/cryptocurrency\n\nFounded in February 2020 by Stephen Young, NFTfi is a decentralised and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan platform where users can list their NFT collateral to get loan offers from other users.\n\nOn the platform, you can request for a loan using your NFT and other users start bidding to lend you money in cryptocurrency with varying interest rates and repayment terms. Once you accept an offer, you\u2019ll receive wETH or DAI liquidity in your wallet and your NFT is transferred into a double-audited escrow smart contract for the loan duration. If you repay the loan before it expires, you\u2019ll get your NFT back. If you default, the lender can foreclose and receive your NFT.\n\nThis is a good innovation considering the amount of money locked in NFTs. Imagine being able to access liquidity without selling off your NFT.\n\nAs crypto continues to gain mass acceptance and adoption, so does the need to make it easy for holders to transact with it. Lazerpay, founded and launched into beta in November last year by Njoku Emmanuel, is a payment gateway for crypto. Think of Paystack, but for crypto.\n\nLast year, Lazerpay secured an undisclosed amount of investment from Nestcoin, an innovative venture that builds, operates, and invests in crypto and Web3 products. As it\u2019s set to launch to the public, the startup is expected to do to cryptocurrency what Paystack and Flutterwave are doing to fiat in Africa.\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July 2021, GetEquity says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nOn GetEquity, users get to invest as little as $10 in startups. Startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nAs at December last year, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nFounded by Jesse Ghansah and Barima Effah, Float, formerly known as Swipe, was launched in June 2021 as a cash management and credit provider fintech company for Africa\u2019s fast-growth companies.\n\nThe startup recently picked up $17 million in equity and debt funding from notable investors across the world including Cauris, Tiger Global, and Justin Mateen\u2019s JAM Fund, Ingressive Capital, Magic Fund, and many angel investors.\n\nThe company is already operational in Nigeria and Kenya and the seed round is expected to expedite its growth this year.\n\nLaunched in April last year by Ahmed Sabbah, a co-founder at Swvl and Youssef Sholqamy, a former engineer at Uber, Telda is a digital bank that provides free accounts for its users and enables them to send and receive money. It also provides them with a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills.\n\nIn May, just a month after it launched, the company announced that it has raised $5 million pre-seed funding led by Sequoia. It also affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers digitally.\n\nOwing to its achievement in a short period of time, we expect the startup to even achieve more in 2022, so get your eyes peeled on this one.\n\nEdtech\n\nCraydel is an edtech startup that was launched in March 2021 by Manish Sardana, John Nguru, and Shayne Aman Premji. The startup creates a reliable portal to guide African students in their tertiary education, course selection, and career decisions.\n\nCraydel provides a digital end-to-end higher education service. Its service spans from the point of students choosing schools, programmes, and courses to the application and admission stages. The company also provides visa support for those who choose to study abroad, all for free.\n\nCraydel is already in partnership with 90 institutions across Canada, the UK and US, Ireland, and African countries like Malawi and Kenya. There are over 3,000 courses\u2014spread across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes\u2014available to choose from.\n\nFounded in May 2021 but launched into beta in December by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nThe platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. It has raised a $3.5 million pre-seed capital war chest from Target Global and top African founders like Shola Akindolu and Babs Ogundeyin, among others, to bring effective education to its target audience.\n\nWith the founder\u2019s experience, quality of the team, and the early investment secured, we expect this startup to do great things in the edtech sector this year.\n\nHealthtech\n\nBypa-ss was founded by Dr Andrew Saad in 2019 and entered the market with its proprietary product, HealthTag, a platform for Health Information Exchange (HIE), offering physicians a free cloud-based clinic management solution.\n\nThrough linking with a cloud database, HealthTag securely stores medical records collected from different healthcare providers and gives them to their rightful owner, the user.\n\nAs of November last year, Saad said the company currently has over 17,000 HealthTag cardholders and over 3,500 healthcare providers\u2014mainly in clinics, pharmacies, labs, and radiology centers using their product.\n\nBuilt on the blockchain technology, Afya Rekod wants to create a seamless mobilised healthcare in Africa, where the patients\u2014who are the only moving parts in healthcare\u2014own all the rights to their data.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the co-founder and CEO of Adanian Labs John Kamara, Afya Rekod provides 4 unique offerings to its customers: its core patient\u2019s portal; electronic health record systems (EHRs) for hospitals; diagnostic centres for medical labs; and disease management for control and management of chronic diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\n\nEcommerce and logistics\n\nTendo is a social ecommerce platform that eases setup and operating costs for social commerce entrepreneurs by providing them with logistics, financing, and marketing.\n\nFounded by Derrick Mungai, Evans Darbo Boateng, Felix Manford, and Primerose Katena, Tendo provides a curated catalogue of products, marketing tools, and other tools that facilitate trading for its users\u2014resellers\u2014to choose from. Once they sell the product at their own chosen price, Tendo handles the rest\u2014ships the product, subtracts the cost and remits the profit in the account of the seller.\n\nTendo simply enables anyone to start an online shop with zero capital. The company has a unique solution to social commerce. It also made it into Y Combinator 2022 Winter Batch, and this is an indicator of its potential to be watched closely.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by Tola Onayemi and Tope Obanla, Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks, and patent intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country.

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5. Home services\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Yung Nollywood\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one-time food platters? Daily food packages that trump the time-consuming activity of cooking.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, and that includes automating home services like laundry and cooking.\n\nStartups like Eden Life have created platforms where you can subscribe to monthly packages for laundry, cooking and cleaning services. If you\u2019re going to go with the food option for Valentine\u2019s, then go all the way.\n\nPrice range: From $50\n\nThis is labelled Series C because it\u2019s also a long-term gift. Every time your loved one eats or steps into clean rooms and clothes, they\u2019ll think of you and how much you\u2019ve made their lives easier.\n\n6. Crypto\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Corporate Compliance Insights\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue. Crypto is here, and its promise is true.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk much about crypto. Like your relationships, it has its ups and downs, \ud83d\udc80 but that\u2019s what makes us love it.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, add to your loved one\u2019s crypto stash and help them build their way into digital wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, like bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. And if you\u2019re worried about the chances of the coins depreciating, remember that even your relationship is a gamble.\n\nGet on BuyCoins, Yellow Card, Quidax, Nestcoin, or Bitsika to mine your way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nPrice range: From $1 (invest as required).\n\nThis is a Series C gift because it\u2019s long-term for both of you. If the relationship dips, you can take comfort in knowing that whenever crypto dips, so will your ex\u2019s happiness.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please give TechCabal a gift by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp or Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make. He also advised them to contribute to open source blockchain projects and look for ways to solve the problems that exist today in Web2 with Web3.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nThe rate at which Africans use the Internet for cybercrime is alarming and rapidly increasing. Cybercrime affects all countries, but Africa is particularly vulnerable due to inadequate network and security.\n\nAn estimate shows that cybercrime costs the global economy $500 billion, as of 2016. A 2021 study by Techshielder, a technology and online security platform, describes Nigeria as the second most notorious country in the world for romance scams, after the Philippines.\n\nIf I continue with the types of fraud and the countries that top each list, it won\u2019t be surprising to see an African country on every list, which is very worrisome. For instance, South Africa, after Kenya, is the African country most affected by fraud, draining millions of dollars from the mobile accounts of cellular users worldwide on a daily basis, according to research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Evina, a French cybersecurity firm with a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide \u2013 including 15 in Africa \u2013 a recent report titled State of Mobile Fraud in Africa, shows that professional cybercriminals targeting Africa\u2019s one billion mobile phone users continue to be a significant problem.\n\nTo fight this, the company which claims to specialise in fighting fraud in Africa has recently raised a \u20ac20 million (~$23m) Series A to help them improve their game in fighting fraud.\n\nI find that interesting because the company declared that at least half of the \u20ac20 million capital injection will be used to combat fraud in Africa. Yes, you read that correctly; over $12 million will be invested in combating mobile fraud in Africa.\n\nWhile I\u2019m interested in how the company intends to accomplish this, there\u2019s also an indigenous company in Nigeria, Stellas digital bank planning to combat fraud. But before I discuss that, let\u2019s see what happens to your data when you die.\n\nSide bar: Is it possible that the rise of startups focused on combating fraud will help achieve its purpose in Africa? What do you think? Please, click the reply button to respond.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nWho will have access to your accounts if you die right now? Do your siblings or parents have access to all of your digital assets?\n\nNot to scare you, but those thoughts were playing through my head about a fortnight ago. What if, despite my optimism, I kick the bucket without any warning? What will happen to my social media accounts, email accounts, and the small sums of money I\u2019ve saved in Cowrywise and Piggyvest if I don\u2019t wake up again after tonight? I mean, I\u2019d like my family to have it, but how likely is that after I die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many daily functions, tasks, and memories now taking place online, the question of what will become of your digital legacy \u2013 who will preserve, control, or delete your accounts after you die \u2013 has become increasingly important.\n\nMaking a plan now can help you avoid identity theft, save documents and records you want to keep, and keep your friends and family from receiving painful pop-up reminders on social media.\n\nHowever, there are numerous potential stumbling blocks to organising your digital will, ranging from privacy concerns and cybersecurity to copyright.\n\nBut, where does your data go when you die in Africa, where you technically have no rights to your data after death?\n\n\n\nIn the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu walked us through what happens to our data when we die. Please read, where does your data go when you die?\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme in 2011, interbank transactions in Nigeria have become much faster, with several experts hailing it as one of the best globally.\n\nFraudsters have also taken advantage of this, executing faster due to the increased speed. Consequently, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in the last decade and $12 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nBecause fraud remains a problem for both digital and traditional banks, Stellas digital bank \u2014 a microfinance bank founded in 2017 to provide easy access to financial services \u2014 has launched a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? The company plans to protect user identities when conducting transactions to prevent identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nBut how is the Bukola Solomon-led company doing that? To know how, please, read: Stellas digital bank launches, plans to fix major loophole for fintech fraud in Nigeria.\n\nPoS for the web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending money from one bank to another 25 years ago was a very different process than it is today. Transfers frequently took several days to reach their intended recipients. To withdraw money, you had to go to the branch where you opened your account.\n\n\n\nHowever, banking innovation has caused the industry to evolve to the point where transfers can now be completed in a matter of minutes. And the industry has grown at an unprecedented rate due to these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more people shopping online, digital payments have become the order of the day, with startups introducing new features to aid this \u2014 like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) solution for the web, for instance. Thepeer, a startup that creates infrastructure that allows businesses to share data, has launched Checkout to create a simple online checkout experience.\n\nCheckout, according to the startup, is simple to integrate and use on a business\u2019s website. Users can shop online and pay from their favourite businesses using Thepeer Checkout.\n\nTo know what the startup does, please read: Backed by Flutterwave, Thepeer wants to help businesses share data seamlessly using its API\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMental health advice to my younger self. Read.\n\nScience vs God: Watch.\n\nThe prison of your mind | Watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThepeer is hiring an android engineer on contract for 3 months.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2011, interbank transactions have gotten much faster in Nigeria with the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme, an infrastructure that several experts laud as being one of the world\u2019s best.\n\nUnfortunately, this speed of execution meant that fraudsters have been able to execute with greater speed. In 10 years, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime, and in just nine months of 2020, it lost $12 million to electronic fraud.\n\nNigeria\u2019s banking space is, perhaps, one of its most critical sectors, as these companies are tasked with providing essential services to millions of people. Interestingly, we\u2019re observing a trend of banks moving from physical branches to having an online-only presence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear how much Nigerian consumer behaviour has adapted to this trend, investors are seemingly betting that these companies will usher in the future of banking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith different incentives and hooks like free transfers, micro-lending, speedy and efficient customer lending, these banks aim to capture segments of the market that have experienced relative neglect by traditional banks.\n\nHowever, fraud remains the bane of both digital banks, and traditional banks alike. For the newly launched Stellas digital bank, it plans to guard against one major loophole.\n\nLed by Bukola Solomon, an executive with extensive experience in the investment banking space, Stellas microfinance bank started in 2017, to provide easy access to financial services, and it soon became one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial services providers.\n\nToday, the company is launching a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease\u201d. With this launch, it plans to promote privacy and security in the financial services space with its \u201cGhost Mode\u201d feature, as well as other savings and budgeting features, but more on these later.\n\nSolomon explains that the company has always prioritised user experience as one of its biggest value offerings, and it brought that philosophy with its digital banking launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen several instances of people who need to make transactions but want it to remain confidential and private. With our Ghost Mode feature, you can execute confidential transactions, and more so, it serves as a security feature. We can encrypt transactions so that even if they get access to your phone or that of the recipient, your data is secure,\u201d he says.\n\nBasically, Stellas plans to protect user identities when making transactions, to guard against identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nIn 2020, $219 million was lost to identity theft, and these usually come in different forms from social media activities, emails, or credit cards. Solomon points out that transferring money to a random stranger you bought items from could be another potential loophole for identity theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolomon also reveals that all transactions are fully insured by the National Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC) and will strictly comply with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud regulations.\n\nInteresting bells and whistles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Solomon talks up the Ghost Mode feature, he also reveals that the company has integrated a budgeting feature that would help users create better economic plans for themselves.\n\nSo far, Solomon claims it already has a massive userbase with exciting projections for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have 10,000 users already, and we expect it to reach 200,000 in the first month.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely that Stellas would be offering its digital banking services to its existing customers, but it would be interesting to see how it would ht 200k users in one month.\n\nIn a space graced by the likes of Kuda, Sparkle, Fairmoney, and Carbon, Nigeria\u2019s digital banking space look set to be exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "Dirty petrol saga: Middlemen explore fresh tricks in Nigeria\u2019s opaque oil contracts",
          "text": "The controversy concerning dirty petrol has exposed more rot in Nigeria\u2019s opaque oil contracts as latest findings reveal middlemen involved in crude oil swap are exploring the system to short-change the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and ensure Nigerians remain hooked on cheap fuel.\n\nSources close to the business contract tell BusinessDay that the petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp, Belgium were not under the contentious direct sales direct purchase (DSDP) arrangement but under a more opaque contract, seen for the first time in the history of Nigeria\u2019s petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cUnder the DSDP contract, NNPC sells its crude oil to selected middlemen for refined petroleum products. But the contract of dirty petrol saga showed NNPC sold its crude oil to middlemen who sell the product to an international buyer, making super profits thereafter proceeds to get cheap petrol from another refiner in Europe,\u201d a source who has access to the details of the contract says.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThis means the number of briefcase companies or middlemen involved in the value chain of Nigeria\u2019s petroleum sector is increasing every day.\u201d\n\nThis development contradicts the claim by the group managing director of NNPC, who said the four petrol cargoes with methanol-blended petrol came in under the DSDP arrangement.\n\n\u201cInvestigation revealed the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported through the DSDP suppliers including the consortium MRS, Emadeb Consortium, Oando Consortium, and Duke Oil,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nLuqman Agboola, head of energy and infrastructure at Sofidam Capital, disagrees with Kyari\u2019s claim, saying, \u201cSomething shadier than the DSDP contracts we all complained about is happening in this business. The number of middlemen is increasing, which is increasing the cost of business and increasing NNPC\u2019s expenses.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThis middleman is obsessed with making more margins than adding value.\u201d\n\nAdemola Henry, former team leader at the Facility for Oil Sector Transformation (FOSTER), expressed worry about the secrecy of the contracts, noting, \u201cWhy can\u2019t NNPC deal directly with refiners.\u201d\n\nFor over a decade, every year the NNPC requests for bids from interested companies to lift its share of allocated crude since it lacks the capacity to refine them. Rather than sell directly to refiners, the corporation prefers middlemen.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the world\u2019s only major oil producer that sells almost all of its crude to middlemen, rather than end-users (with the exception of highly unstable countries like Libya),\u201d observed a report by the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), a transparency watchdog.\n\nThese trading companies buy the oil from the NNPC but do not refine it themselves. Instead, they sell it, through intermediaries, to other companies, who refine it, a development that is a distinctive feature of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry.\n\nAlthough the scheme looks brilliant on paper, however in reality, experts say the way NNPC organises the programme is overly complex and this, combined with a lack of transparency and oversight in the sector, has made the process conducive to fraud.\n\nFor instance, the 2021 DSDP winners announced for the crude oil lifting contracts had the names of \u2018who is who\u2019 in the oil and gas sector in the country as well as top players in the international oil and gas industry who are compelled to partner with the local players.\n\nAccording to sources, each consortium would receive 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total 320,000 barrels per day of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nThe 2021 winners have popular international trading companies such as major Swiss trading firms Trafigura, Vitol, and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as experienced Nigerian trading companies such as large Nigerian traders Sahara Energy, Oando, MRS Oil, and other so-called \u2018briefcase companies.\u2019\n\n\u201cBriefcase companies are small entities that routinely re-sells the cargoes it gets to another intermediary. For example, a larger, more experienced commodities trading firm, which then re-sells the cargo to a third party buyer,\u201d a report by Netherland-based independent centre for research on multinational corporations (SOMO) and Nigeria-based Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CSLAC), said.\n\nAccording to the report written by Saskia van Drunen, Ilona Hartlief, Chinedu Bassey, and Ken Henshaw, \u201cthese briefcase companies are often inexperienced companies with no track record of selling and refining crude oil, and appear to be more politically motivated than commercially driven.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are often inexperienced and lacking financial and commercial capacity,\u201d SOMO and CISLAC report explained.\n\nAnother report by the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), which analysed this phenomenon in Nigeria extensively was critical of how the NNPC organises its crude oil sales and has repeatedly advocated for reform over the years. It criticised the system of selling oil to intermediaries who can earn significant margins, but add little or no value to NNPC, especially when the buyers are unqualified, such as the so-called briefcase companies.\n\nRead also: Explainer: Methanol is good in petrol, bad for engine when excess\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of politically connected briefcase companies contributes to the perception that Nigeria\u2019s petroleum sector is pervasively corrupt, frightening off some investors,\u201d the NRGI said.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite efforts to reform the sector, the Nigerian oil industry continues to be plagued by ineffectiveness and maladministration, with corruption a recurrent problem,\u201d the SOMO and CISLAC report noted.\n\nThe report also raised red flags about the Nigerian operations of Vitol, one of the largest energy traders in the world, with annual revenues comparable to Apple.\n\nLike other oil traders, Vitol has in the past been associated with several controversies, including allegations of corruption and fraud, a development the company has repeatedly denied.\n\n\u201cThe company fails to communicate how it addresses specific risks and impacts in challenging business environments and sectors like the oil industry in Nigeria,\u201d the SOMO and CISLAC report said.\n\nIt added, \u201cDespite Vitol\u2019s stakes in Nigeria, the company is not very visible in the country. Vitol\u2019s offices in Lagos and Abuja are in the buildings of two partner companies, Hyson Nigeria Limited and Mansel Commercial Services (Vitol\u2019s commercial tanker shipping arm).\u201d",

          "title": "What Abuja council elections mean for APC, PDP",
          "text": "For the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), this Saturday\u2019s Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Councils election is not just another democratic exercise as it is done in the other 36 states of the federation.\n\nBasically, the exercise is to elect chairmen into the six Area Councils of Abaji, Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Bwari, Gwagwalada, Kuje, and Kwali, and councillors for the 62 wards that made up the territory.\n\nIn the final list published by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the umpire for the election, 14 political parties have sponsored 473 candidates, comprising 110 for chairmanship and deputy chairmanship as well as 363 stand-bearers for councilor-ship seats.\n\nWhile the other 12 political parties may merely see the election as an opportunity to control government at that level, the remaining two, APC and PDP, the poll is a launchpad to test their strength ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIt is crystal clear and audibly loud that APC, despite its perceived failure, wants to retain power while the PDP with the alleged baggage of having laid the foundation for the socio-economic quagmire of the country when it held sway for 16 years, intends to return to Aso Rock in the next round of the national election.\n\nThe FCT Area Councils\u2019 poll now provides a rehearsal stage for the APC and PDP to claim the soul of Nigeria in 2023 because the nation\u2019s capital is the microcosm of the macrocosm in the country.\n\nThough with indigenous inhabitants of Gbagyi/Gwari, the FCT-Abuja since it became Nigeria\u2019s capital city is populated by almost all the ethnic groups in the country, making it a semi-Nigeria.\n\nMost of the non-indigenous residents of the FCT who have lived in the area for a long period and with some of them given birth to in the city are registered voters and exercised their franchise in the territory.\n\nThus, for either the APC or PDP to win or lose the Saturday\u2019s area councils election may imply acceptability or rejection of each of the parties.\n\nAlso, being the seat of power, the outcome of the election in the FCT gives credence to either APC\u2019s ability to retain power and PDP\u2019s strength to stage a comeback.\n\nThis is because President Muhammadu Buhari, who heads the APC government and all the apparatus thereof, along with his appointees and lawmakers of the party are residents of the FCT, just as the PDP national leadership.\n\nThe outcome of the election is going to be a testimony on the APC, almost more than the PDP because of the general thinking that the party has brought untold hardship on Nigerians to the extent that it would be paid back in its own coins at any available ballot.\n\nThis is the belief of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who was Buhari\u2019s main challenger in the 2019 ballot when he said the FCT council polls were going to be a referendum on the APC.\n\nAtiku had days ago in a statement by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, said the people of the FCT, with their closeness to the seat of power, represent a good sampling of Nigerians and, therefore, should use \u201ctheir ballot to tell the APC government how its administration has made life difficult for the common man.\n\n\u201cThe records of performance between the PDP and APC administrations should provide a guide for the way the people of the FCT should cast their ballot on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI expect every member of the PDP to be proud of the party at this election and even mobilise their families and friends to vote for PDP\u2019s candidates across all the FCT councils on Saturday,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nNeither the political strength of APC nor PDP is in doubt in the FCT, at least judging from the 2019 general election and the Area Councils\u2019 polls.\n\nFor the presidential election, the PDP candidate, Abubakar defeated the APC\u2019S Buhari with 259,997 votes against 152,224; the main opposition also won the only senatorial and two House of Representatives seats in the territory, followed closely by the ruling party.\n\nBut for the FCT Area Council polls, APC took the day having won five out of the six chairmanship with many councillor-ship seats while the PDP got one chairmanship (Kuje Council) and a handful of councillors.\n\nUnlike in other states of the federation where governors allegedly handpick their party members or cronies as council chairmen and councillors through State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIEC), the FCT election is conducted by INEC, which is not a direct appendage of states\u2019 chief executives.\n\nThe territory has no governor despite its status of a state and is rather administered by a minister, who is always not an indigene on behalf of the President, making it a bit not subservient to the whims and caprices of any governor.\n\nHowever, the APC and PDP being at dagger drawn point to test their might in the Saturday FCT Area Council poll, each of them has deployed many of their governors, lawmakers and other top-notch for the electoral battle.\n\nThe PDP appointed a 34-member campaign council, chaired by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State with governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo as secretary, Nyesom Wike of Rivers and Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto; former Senate President, David Mark, immediate past governor of Benue State, Gabriel Suswam, among others as members.\n\nSimilarly, the ruling APC raised a 133-member campaign council, chaired by Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, which included 16 serving governors, 12 federal ministers as well as members of the National Assembly for the same election.\n\nRead also: APC, PDP, others sign peace accord for FCT area council election\n\nBoth the governors-dominated APC and PDP campaign councils are already in Abuja, perfecting plans and campaigning for the victory of their parties on Saturday.\n\nFor instance, the Uzodinma-led APC campaign council has reconciled the warring factions of the party, especially in the AMAC to strengthen the broom family ahead of the Saturday poll.\n\nAlready, an alarm is being raised especially by the opposition PDP in the FCT that APC was planning to disrupt the process and rig its way into power.\n\nFCT PDP chairman, Sunday Zaka, a few days ago alleged that the APC had planned to hire fake security agents from neighbouring Nasarawa and Kogi states to arrest some of its members ahead of the council election.\n\n\u201cIn the build-up to next Saturday the 12th February 2022, local government election in the FCT, our intelligence network have reported some appalling findings and we have deemed it fit as a law-abiding and democratic party to notify the general public and as well as the international community concerning the elections.\n\n\u201cThere is an underground plan to use fake security agents to arrest and detain prominent members and stakeholders of our party ahead of the February 12 election.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking this likely because the same scheme was deployed in the last 2019 election but failed due to the display of professionalism by the heads of security operatives in the FCT, and now this same satanic plan by the opposition is resurfacing, but we believe strongly it will fail again,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut the spokesman of the FCT APC, Usman Adaji, described the allegations as baseless, saying the ruling party had always focused on issue-based campaigns.\n\nAdaji said the opposition PDP was only shedding tears of defeat ahead of the Saturday council election, adding that the PDP was always known for raising false alarms.",

Enabulele Ferguson, while speaking to journalists during the inspection of the asphalting of 5km road, for the first phase of the total of 105.6km Benin-Abraka Road, expressed satisfaction with the progress of work on the road.\n\nThe governor, who was accompanied by members of the board of EDSOGPADEC led by Pastor Kennedy Osifo, said his government is committed to the infrastructural development of the state, ensuring that Edo is placed on the path to sustainable growth and development.\n\nHe, however, noted that despite being a federal road, the project will be completed and delivered to the people at the stipulated time, pledging to ensure its completion before 2025.\n\nOn his part, Osifo expressed satisfaction with the pace of work, asserting that the road project, when completed, will not only curtail rural-urban migration, but facilitate the development and transportation of economic crops, thereby increasing the revenue base of the state.\n\nHe charged the contractor handling the project to expedite the completion of the asphalting of the 5km for the first quarter of this year.\n\nOn behalf of the contractors handling the project, Joseph Chidac said that the federal road is 105.6km, but the ongoing asphalt laying for 5km is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022, which is part of the 40km which ends in Ugon\u2019yekorhionmwon.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Apart from improving infrastructure, building Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium and 20 other mini stadia, the standard and conduct during the games have established clearly that the state has created a new era in terms of managing sporting festivals in the country.\u201d\n\nCommending the Local Organising Committee for the hosting of the sports tourney, Obaseki stated, \u201cMost impressive for me is the prudent management of scarce resources.

With the development, 10 percent of Edo population are now members of PDP.\n\nThe e-registration and revalidation exercise is aimed at migrating the party\u2019s membership database from analogue to digital, building a durable and comprehensive database of party members.\n\nThe exercise, in its pilot phase, targets to register at least one million persons in Edo. The party has now hit a record of 500,000 whose biometrics, phone numbers and addresses are captured in the PDP digital database.\n\nThe governor noted that with the successful exercise, the party was well-positioned to retain power as the ruling party in the state.\n\nAccording to Obaseki, \u201cI want to assure our loyal party members that we are truly proud of what is going on in terms of registration, which is inching towards half a million (500,000) members in the State.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are working diligently, going round the state to register and revalidate members. By the grace of God, before the end of this month 10 percent of the population of the state will be PDP members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see how PDP will lose power again in Edo State, provided we continue to provide services for Edo people,\u201d he added.\n\nCharging members and leaders of the party on the need to remain united so as to win future elections in the state, Obaseki further noted: \u201cThere must be party discipline going forward; we can\u2019t tolerate indiscipline and disloyalty to the party. If you can\u2019t get what you want, it doesn\u2019t mean the party must be disunited.

Oladimeji Fabiyi denies knowledge of the amorphous groups insisting that they are mischief makers being used by disgruntled individuals to advance their narrow interests.\n\n\u201cI would like to make it abundantly clear that the AASG which has the records of hundreds of credible and authenticated Atiku support groups nationwide and in the Diaspora does not know of such amorphous groups. Let it be known that these so-called groups are at best interlopers,\u201d Dimeji said.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is eminently qualified under the constitution of Nigeria to contest for any office in the land. Above all, he is experienced, competent and has the capacity to preside over the affairs of our country at this critical point of its life.\n\nIt is therefore ridiculous and malicious to see some individuals acting in ignorance of the provisions of the law.\n\nIt is, however, not surprising because at every political season such as we are in, we witness all sorts of political jobbers, paid agents and charlatans masquerading as groups to do the bidding of enemies of democracy. Indeed, Nigerians expect more of such shenanigans.\n\nAlready our intelligence has exposed the plot of these enemies of democracy to malign and discredit Atiku Abubakar in order to advance their narrow interests. Printed materials at UTC in Area 10 of Abuja are awaiting deployment.\n\nEven as security agencies are being put on notice of these nefarious activities, I call on Nigerians to ignore them as one can see that some of the reasons adduced by the groups are not only ridiculous, but lacking in substance.\n\n\u201cThe question that should be asked is who is afraid of Atiku? Everyone can see that Atiku is the issue in 2023; he is the phenomenon in 2023 that is why you see all the attacks from all angles both within the PDP and APC directed at him. We have seen how these desperate elements have gone to the extent of mass printing anti Atiku campaign items in Abuja which can never help them and their pay masters. For Atiku and his supporters it\u2019s about the real issues, it\u2019s about discourse on how to move Nigeria forward not about their shenanigans and inordinate ambition. Atiku remains the preferred choice of the majority of PDP members and Nigerians at large therefore, the attack by enemies to stall Nigeria\u2019s progress cannot stop an idea whose time has come.\u201d",

I will rely on you to share the concept note for further action.\u201d\n\nThe President, who endorsed the 2021 APC Youth Conference Report presented to him, assured the Group that the recommendations in the report that are within his own remit would be given favourable consideration.\n\nHe also promised to encourage the leadership of the States and the party to implement the recommendations of the report for the benefit of young progressives.\n\nDescribing the President as the leader of the party and moral compass of the nation, the APC Youth leader thanked him for sending a powerful delegation to the Progressive Youth Conference in June 2021, demonstrating that the present government believes in young people.\n\n\u201dMr President, young people in Nigeria believe in your capacity and the history of your public service. You joined the Army at the age of 20, you joined the war to save the country at the age of 25, became a governor at the age of 33, minister at 36 and Head of State at 41.\n\n\u201dYou joined politics at the age of 60 and was elected President at the age of 72. You have demonstrated through your personal example, the integrity that very few people have had the opportunity to demonstrate in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the forthcoming APC national convention, Ahmed appealed to the President to speak for the \u201dyoung people whenever we are not there to speak for ourselves, as you have always done.\u201d",

          "text": "Oando Plc, has denied importing adulterated and substandard petrol into the country, as claimed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Limited.\n\nThe Corporation had in a statement named four oil companies involved in the importation of offspec petrol in the country, including Oando.\n\nIn a sharp reaction to the allegation, Oando in a statement by Ayotola Jagun Company Secretary and Alero Balogun Head, Corporate Communications, said, \u201cFollowing media reports listing Oando as one of four importers that supplied methanol-blended Premium Motor Spirits (PMS) into the country, we hereby state that Oando did not import and supply PMS that was adulterated or substandard.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, The PMS supplied by Oando met Nigeria\u2019s import specification. \u201cWe are committed to working assiduously with the NNPC and industry to identify the root cause(s) of the subsequent contamination of the PMS supplied.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe want to assure the public that Oando as a responsible corporate citizen would not partake in the importation, distribution, or marketing of substandard petroleum products.\u201d the statement read.\n\nHowever, the Corporation reassured Nigerians of its capacity to restore sanity in the supply and distribution of quality Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol across the country within a short period.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer/ Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari made the pledge at the end of a meeting with some oil marketers to resolve the issues generated by the recent supply and discharge of methanol blended petrol in some Nigerian depots.\n\nKyari emphasized that defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions and NNPC is working with the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority (NMDRA) to take necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProviding a graphic chronicle of the unfortunate incident, the NNPC CEO said that on 20th January 2022,the company received a report from its quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in PMS cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.\n\nHe explained that NNPC investigation revealed the presence of Methanol in four PMS cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil under the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase (DSDP).\n\nHe noted that cargoes quality certificates issued at loadport (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicated that the gasoline complied with Nigerian Specification.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge also showed that the gasoline met Nigerian specification,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nKyari noted that as a standard practice for all PMS import to Nigeria, the said cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the NMDRA.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for Percent methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, in order to prevent the distribution of the petrol, the NNPC CEO said the company promptly ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\nAlso, the Corporation, has halted distribution of over 100 million liters of off-specification petrol industry officials said February 9.\n\nNNPC Ltd. is intensifying efforts to increase supply of its petrol imports, urging some trading houses to urgently secure prompt supplies, they said.\n\nA Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, cargo that discharged petrol into Nigeria late last month was labeled off-spec for high methanol content, officials told S&P Global Platts.\n\nNigerian fuel marketer MRS Oil said February 9 that the contaminated gasoline it received had originated from a cargo supplied by Litasco, the trading arm of Russia\u2019s Lukoil.\n\nA representative at Litasco was unavailable for immediate comment.\n\nNigeria imports around 1 million-1.25 million mt/month of gasoline to meet all of its national demand, estimated at 53 million liters/d.\n\nIn a statement, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, confirmed that \u201climited quantities for petrol with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification were discovered in the supply chain.\u201d NMDPRA said the supplier of the off-spec product had been identified and further commercial and appropriate action would be taken, but it did not name the trading house.\n\n\u201cThe product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market including loaded trucks in transit,\u201d it said.\n\nMethanol can be regular additive in gasoline, usually blended in very small quantities.\n\nThe affected cargo was imported under the country\u2019s direct sale and direct purchase scheme and was received last week at a major reception terminal offshore Lagos operated by major fuel marketers for onward distribution across the country.\n\nMRS Oil Nigeria, one of the companies involved in the DSDP, said it had received 5,000 mt of the contaminated gasoline, which had a 20 per cent methanol content.\n\nIn a statement on February 9, MRS said the consignment of gasoline had originated from the vessel Nord Gainer, which was supplied by Litasco, the trading arm of Russia\u2019s Lukoil. MRS said four other companies had also received this product in different quantities.\n\nThe Nord Gainer discharged around 45,000 mt of gasoline in Lagos over Jan. 24-30 from a cargo that loaded from Antwerp on Jan. 2, according to data from Platts below trade-flow analytics software.\n\nNNPC is currently the only sole importer of gasoline, through its trading arm Duke Oil, because of the current subsidy regime. This product is then supplied to many retail fuel companies like MRS Oil. Private marketers have been reluctant to directly import gasoline on the grounds that the pump price is regulated and therefore they won\u2019t be able to recover their costs.\n\n\u201cMRS had a total of 350,000 litres in tank at the eight stations; we await approval from NNPC and NMDPRA for the return of the product,\u201d MRS Oil said. \u201cThe eight stations have been isolated, but there are other tanks within the stations that will receive uncontaminated product for sale as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMarketers that had already taken delivery of the fuel include the local subsidiary of TotalEnergies and several other indigenous companies, which have had to shut down operations, leading to gasoline shortages.\n\n\u201cWe have had to close down our outlets because of this contaminated fuel,\u201d an official of TotalEnergies said. \u201cMotorists have reported damages to their cars.\u201d\n\nMotorists formed long queues at gas stations in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital Abuja and the country\u2019s commercial capital Lagos.\n\nNigeria has struggled for years to address the vehicle pollution crisis due to the poor quality of fuels it was importing.\n\nDespite being Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, Nigeria imports almost all the gasoline it consumes locally, due to the poor performance of the four state-owned refineries.\n\nThe plants, with a combined nameplate capacity of 445,000 b/d, have been shut for repairs for many years, and the government is currently working on overhauling them.",

He is on his way out of politics and government that is why he is desperately seeking for a soft landing from prosecution by joining the ruling party to get political immunity from investigation by the hard working EFCC who are already closing in on his case.\u201d",

This country belongs to all of us and you know that oil is the major source of revenue for the federation, that the three tiers of government share from.\n\n\u201cSo, you cannot, because you\u2019re of the opposition, close your eyes and allow that to happen. No responsible government does that. This is not about party. It is about Nigeria. It is about making sure this country survives and then also the health factor.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to take this war very seriously. Not only because it is sabotage to the national economy but also for the health of our people, which, for me, is the key why we must fight against this sabotage.\u201d\n\nThe Governor commended the security agencies and some chairmen of councils who have shown seriousness in the fight against operators of illegal crude oil refineries in the state.\n\nHe, however, urged them not to rest on their oars because the fight is far from over to save Rivers people and all residents of the likely ailment soot causes.\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s take this as war that we must save our people. And we must save our nation. I commend you so far, for the efforts. But we must redouble our efforts and not to give any chances to these armed robbers that they called bunkers.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, they\u2019re even worse than armed robbers. One who sabotages the national economy is worse than an armed robbers.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that the list bearing the names of those selected to be part of the taskforce against illegal refining activities has been sent to the Department of State Services(DSS) for profiling.\n\nAccording to him, the prospective members are drawn from councils areas where their chairmen have shown commitment to the fight.\n\nGovernor Wike urged the DSS to be dutiful and attend to it quickly so that those who scaled can be assigned their responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIt is important that when you profile them, you do it quickly too so that they can start work. Those in whom we have no trust, we remove them\u201d.\n\nHe added that he has approved the money that was pledged to councils that have identified and destroyed sites used for illegal crude oil refining.\n\nHe clarified that only five local government areas have satisfied the conditions to get the fund.\n\n\u201cI will not give a Local Government money that I have not seen any commitment. No, I won\u2019t do that. I want to see commitment. So, it is only those that have shown commitment that I have approved the money for.\u201d\n\nOur Correspondent reports that the Governor had promised to grant N20 million each to the 23 local government Council Chairmen to fight the illegal oil bunkering.\n\nEnds",

          "title": "2023: Have APC, PDP jettisoned zoning?",
          "text": "\u2026Zoning unconstitutional, but\u2026- Lawyer\n\n\u2018\u2026It won\u2019t give room for selfless, visionary candidates to emerge\u2019\n\n\u2026All zones should be treated fairly \u2013 PDP\n\n\u2026Why ruling party looking the other way \u2013 Chieftain\n\nWith about one year until the 2023 general elections, the ambitions of most politicians within the two major political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), still hang in the balance over zoning arrangements. ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE in this report wonder why the two leading parties plan to throw their presidential tickets open.\n\nAs the countdown to the 2023 presidential election continues, aspirants from the major political parties, APC and PDP, continue to strategise and oil their structures towards occupying Aso Rock. Bigwigs from the North and the South within the two parties are reportedly consulting and setting up structures for the election.\n\nExpectations were that upon the completion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second term in office, the South would have the opportunity to produce the next president based on the principle of zoning. However, there are indications that with politicians from the northern region already strategising to be in the race the principle may be either set aside or jettisoned.\n\nNigeria has had 15 heads of government and presidents since it became an independent nation in 1960. Notably, out of the 15 civilian and military leaders that ruled her since independence, 10, including the incumbent president, are from the North while five are from the South.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria has had so many conferences to correct perceived imbalance in the nation\u2019s political system beginning from the 1994/1995 Constitutional Conference (CC) organised by the late head of state, Sani Abacha, the National Political Reform Conference (NPRC) convoked by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2005, and the most recent National Conference during the administration of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in 2014.\n\nAll these conferences adopted rotational presidency between the North and the South, though 1994/1995, 2005 and 2014 conferences recommended that the principle of power rotation should be enshrined in the Constitution so that executive positions rotate at federal, state and local governments. However, it has not been included in the Constitution; hence rotational presidency remains a recommended principle.\n\nLegality\n\nIn a phone interview with this reporter, a legal practitioner and a political analyst, Suleiman Ibrahim, described zoning as \u201can unconstitutional arrangement.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s now a tradition that whenever we approach an election year, the zoning debate dominates the media space. In the last couple of weeks a few politicians within the APC and the PDP have made their intentions known to Nigerians while others for the fear of the unknown are still pursuing their presidential ambition quietly.\n\n\u201cEven as agitations continue to build up from various political support groups and even socio-ethnic groups, the zoning arrangement remains unconstitutional. Many politicians have benefitted from it and it has also cut short the political lifespan of some politicians when it was perceived that they or their party breached the principle.\n\n\u201cSo, because it is not binding on political parties to zone presidential tickets between the North and South, the APC and PDP may throw their 2023 tickets open. The PDP\u2019s major concern remains to win the 2023 election. For the APC too, their major goal is to ensure that the party remains intact so that it can win the 2023 election.\u201d\n\nIbrahim added: \u201cHowever, unlike in the PDP, leaving the ticket open in the APC does not mean it will be dominated by northern aspirants or that they will give the party\u2019s ticket to another northerner to succeed President Buhari. It is likely going to be open in the two parties, but the southern aspirants appeared to stand a better chance in the APC, while another northern may emerge as the candidate of the PDP.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, zoning remains unconstitutional, but it\u2019s a child of necessity considering Nigeria\u2019s complexity. So, to address some of the political imbalances, it has become part of the political consciousness and has been adopted in most political parties during elections across the country.\u201d\n\nFear of implosion\n\nIn his view, a political analyst, Aminu Muhammed, thinks the two major parties are planning to throw the contest for their 2023 presidential tickets open because of the fear of party implosion.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend, Mohammed said, \u201cThere are many reasons the APC and PDP may throw open the race for its 2023 presidential tickets. Among other reasons, this will allow all zones to field aspirants.\n\n\u201cAlso, in a party where the likes of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto state governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal; Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike; Bauchi state governor Senator Bala Mohammed; former Senate Presidents Anyim Pius Anyim and Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Chief Dele Momodu; Mazi Samuel Iheanyichukwu Ohuabunwa, among others all from different zones wanting to be president, it will be difficult to adopt zoning because some may be favoured and it may cause internal rancour within the party.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, in the other party where the likes of former Lagos state governor Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and many others from different parts of the country, do you want the party to zone its ticket? Of course, it will cost them a lot, including victory.\u201d\n\nMuhammed said further, \u201cSo, the two major parties are planning to leave it open because of the bigwigs that are interested in flying their flags. It is also as a result of the fear of implosion; if it is zoned against a particular aspirant with resources and a huge support base, the person and the supporters may storm out of the party and that will affect the party\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cZoning the 2023 presidential ticket is a banana peel that APC and PDP are trying to avoid. This will also help them to avoid an intra-party crisis, get more resources and go into the election united without losing critical and influential stakeholders.\n\n\u201cMajorly, to avoid internal crisis, the fear of implosion and hunger or desperation to win is why they want to jettison zoning.\n\nAn ex-lawmaker\u2019s admonition\n\nOn his part, Hon. Hassan Saleh said aspirants and members have continued to urge political parties to throw their 2023 ticket open to give room for a selfless and visionary candidate to emerge.\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint Weekend, the former member of the House of Representatives said, \u201cWhat is important is that all political parties should be in line with the provisions of the Nigerian constitution and the constitution of various political parties to provide a level-playing field for all.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the major political parties have now realised that Nigerians are yearning for good governance; Nigerians are saying that let us have a credible person that will unify the country; they want candidates that can secure and develop Nigeria and not a candidate that will emerge because of zoning arrangements without anything to show.\n\n\u201cWhether the next president is from the North or South shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Political parties should not inflame the polity by this demand for zoning. I have seen on the news that what Nigerians want now is a change from poverty, insecurity; a change from ethnic jingoism and a change from division to unity. So, this should be the major concern of political parties across the country, including the PDP. What is important is that Nigeria needs that selfless and visionary leader that will unite the country. And that is what should be of concern to all Nigerians. So, the parties should provide a level-playing field; that is the only way to get the best for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Northern Advocate of Good Governance (NAFGG) in a letter dated February 2, 2022, addressed to the national chairman of the PDP by the national coordinator, Malam Mahmoud Mohammed Katun, requested that the party\u2019s presidential ticket be thrown open.\n\nIt vehemently kicked against that \u201cillogical pressure being mounted by some interest groups and self-serving politicians, who are insisting that the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 must be zoned to the Southern part of the country.\u201d\n\nThe letter read in part, \u201cWe state without equivocation that the presidency of Nigeria is open to all zones and most importantly zones that have not produced the president of our country.\n\n\u201cWe denounce those propagating the Southern agenda and further make bold to say that these are nothing but the machinations of a few politicians who are only after their interests under the guise of rotational presidency.\n\n\u201cIn the event that the All Progressives Congress (APC), PDP, All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Young Progressives Party (YPP) or any other political party wishes to zone their presidential tickets, the North-east and North-central should be considered first because these two zones have not produced the president of Nigeria\n\n\u201cBut even more importantly, it is our considered position that political parties should prioritise experience, competence and capacity in choosing or zoning their presidential tickets.\u201d\n\nPDP scribe\u2019s take\n\nOn his part, the deputy national publicity secretary of the PDP, Ibrahim Abdullahi, said the party plans to ditch zoning so that it will be fair to the six geo-political zones.\n\n\u201cThe new National Working Committee (NWC) under the leadership of Senator Iyorchia Ayu has already resolved that this is exactly what he will pursue as an objective in ensuring that the six geo-political zones of Nigeria are given an equal opportunity to bill for the available offices to rescue and re-build Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere will be hope for Nigerians who have lost hope and their hope will be redeemed. In the days ahead you will find the vehicle to join which is PDP. That dashed hope, that lost hope will be rekindled.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Nigerians are bidding from the South-east, South-west, and the North. No section of Nigeria should be denied an opportunity to contest or aspire, it is left for Nigerians to decide where they want to allow the president go.\u201d\n\nAPC chieftain\u2019s position\n\nMeanwhile, a chieftain of the APC who was chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Intelligence and Internal Security, Aminu Sani Jaji, charged the ruling party to jettison zoning for due diligence to take place.\n\nIn a chat with our reporter, Jaji said the zoning arrangement was a caricature and that allowing space for everybody who thinks he has something to offer to aspire is the best thing to do.\n\n\u201cThe issue of zoning is just political understanding but not something institutional. Most of the zoning arrangements are caricatures. So, let us allow the due diligence to take place. We want to grow politically and democratically.\n\n\u201cSo, let us allow space for everybody who thinks he has something to offer; that is the best because if you say you want to zone the Presidency to the North and people in the South like him because of his capacity, he believes in Nigeria\u2019s unity and has all the credentials to become a good president and you say he should not contest because we have zoned it to the North and you are from the South, there will be a problem. So, what do you think? That means you are disenfranchising that person and stopping him from serving his fatherland.\n\n\u201cThe issue of zoning is a mere arrangement. I don\u2019t subscribe to that arrangement. As far back as 2015, I opposed it. But I will support any person with integrity and credibility that can pilot the affairs of the state. Anybody who is going to contest I look at their pedigree and his ability to work all round the clock. That is my candidate.\u201d",

          "text": "The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has commended the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) on its handling of the contaminated Petrol Motor Spirit (PMS), and scarcity of the product experienced across Nigeria in recent times.\n\nThe NNPC had revealed that the scarcity was occasioned by the importation of adulterated fuel by suppliers.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Friday, in Abuja, NYCN President, Solomon Adodo, explained that the council had set up a task force to interface with relevant stakeholders to ascertain the situation.\n\nComrade Adodo who addressed journalists after an emergency session of the leadership of the council, said the task force of the NYCN wasted no time in carrying out its assignment and made so much discovery.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. led by Mele Kyari immediately ordered the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck and marine) after it discovered the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/ Hyde/Ay Maikifi/Brittania- U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\n\u201cOur task force also found out that the NNPC also asked oil companies to embark on emergency supply of petrol to replace cargoes that were rejected as a result of their poor quality.\n\n\u201cThese remedial actions aimed at arresting the use of the contaminated fuel inadvertently disrupted the country\u2019s fuel supply chain and led to the damage of several cars.\n\n\u201cWe are satisfied with the prompt action taken by the federal government in ordering for a full investigation into the bad fuel that damaged engines of some vehicles.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we commend the transparency and full disclosure adopted by Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. under the leadership of Mallam Mele Kyari in getting to the root of the problem. Without doubt, the decision of NNPC to order the quarantine of all unevacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel saved the nation from a monumental scandal.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, the decision of NNPC to order the quarantine of all unevacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel saved the nation from a monumental scandal. This is a welcome departure from the past when the activities of the oil giant was shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\u201cAlready, Mele Kyari in pursuit of the transparency regime of NNPC under his leadership disclosed that the cargoes quality certification at the loading port in Belgium by Am Spec Belgium indicated that the product complied with Nigerian specification but that petrol brought into Nigeria usually does not include the test for the level of methanol content.\n\n\u201cIn order to forestall future occurrence of importation of methanol blended fuel, a mechanism should be put in place to test the level of methanol content to make sure that it is in full compliance.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing investigation by the federal government must be transparent, holistic, far reaching and targeted to prevent further occurrence. Government must impose punitive sanctions/ punishment on corporate entities found to be in breach of their mandate or liable for this scandal.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on government to compensate Nigerians whose vehicle engines were damaged by the methanol blended fuel.\n\n\u201cWe call citizens not to engage in panic buying as NMDPRA has announced the arrival of 300million litres of fuel. This arrival will help resupply the nation\u2019s disrupted fuel chain and clear the queues being experienced at filling stations.\n\n\u201cThe scarcity of fuel that was experienced is not part of any secret plan of government to introduce full deregulation through the back door. The source of the problem has been identified and will be solved. The present administration has achieved so much in the petroleum industry and we are confident that it will do everything within its power to protect this legacy and pass it on to the incoming administration at the end of its tenure next year.\u201d",

          "text": "For the umpteenth time, President Muhammadu Buhari has warned foreign diplomats against meddling in the internal politics of Nigeria as the nation prepares for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThis was the second time in five months that the president would be asking diplomats to steer clear of nation\u2019s local politics.\n\nPresident Buhari had on October 25, 2021, while presenting Letters of Credence to the Ambassadors of Japan, European Union, Burundi, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Cape Verde, France, Qatar; and High Commissioners of Sierra Leone and Ghana, urged foreign envoys to be guided by diplomatic practices to ensure that their activities remain within the limits of their profession in the build-up to the 2023 general elections.\n\nHowever, speaking again on Thursday, while presenting Letters of Credence to four Ambassadors at the State House, Abuja, the president advised diplomats in the country to stay within the limits of their schedules, and not intrude in the internal politics of the country as countdown to 2023 elections begins.\n\nBuhari, who welcomed the Ambassadors of Czech Republic, Zdenek Krejci; Italy, Stephano De Leo; Spain, Juan Ignacio Sell Sanz and Israel, Michael Shual Freeman, said:\n\n\u201cYou are assuming your diplomatic responsibilities in Nigeria at very interesting political period as Nigeria\u2019s national elections are due in early 2023.\n\n\u201cAs you settle down in the face of these developments, it is my hope that you will also be guided by diplomatic practice, to ensure that your activities remain within the limits of your profession as you monitor the build-up to and the conduct of the general elections next year.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president called for the support of the envoys in tackling rising global insecurity, and strengthening of communality.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe are living in unprecedented times and with so many uncertainties, especially with the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the rise in global insecurity and the devastation of our environments caused by climate change among other existential threats to our collective peace, progress and shared values.\n\n\u201cDifferent factors that accounted for these challenges go beyond the abilities of any single country to effectively contain alone. Matters of security have become the business of all the nations of the world to work closely together to build consensus in order to overcome these challenges.\u201d\n\nBuhari told the diplomats that, \u201cfor us in Nigeria We continue to make steady progress despite the daunting challenges, especially in the areas of insecurity, fight against corruption, diversification of the economy, and our efforts in promoting good governance, amongst other aspirations.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s differences and divergence in culture and religion had contributed immensely in cementing unity, as a people, as well as spurring religious tolerance and respect for one another.\n\nBuhari urged the Ambassadors to build lasting friendships in the course of performing their duties that will go beyond assignments in Nigeria.\n\nAt the regional level, the president said Nigeria would continue to work with other member-states of ECOWAS and regional blocs to deal with the problems of terrorism, trans-border crimes, banditry, maritime issues and unconstitutional change of government.\n\n\u201cWe are engaging in frank self-retrospection in order to identify and isolate appropriate containment strategies that can help de-escalate the drift into the unconstitutional seizure of power in the sub region,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nBuhari assured of partnership and mutual cooperation in canvassing more Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in healthcare system, education, infrastructure, local manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness and transportation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe countries which you all represent, namely, Czech Republic, Republic of Italy, Kingdom of Spain and State of Israel, enjoy very cordial bilateral relations and cooperation with Nigeria that span across our socio-economic and cultural spheres.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the envious task of building on the successes of your respective predecessors will further advance our relations to significant heights for the benefits of our countries and peoples.\n\n\u201cAs you settle down to your diplomatic responsibilities, I am sure that you will appreciate the uniqueness and strength in our country\u2019s political, socio-economic and cultural diversities, in terms of both human and natural resources.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of other envoys, the Ambassador of Czech Republic assured the President of, \u201ccomprehensive cooperation\u2019\u2019 of the representatives.\n\nKrejc said the envoys would work for the development of Nigeria, through strengthening of mutual and beneficial relations with their countries.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, on Thursday said his principal had yet to sign the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 because he was still consulting with stakeholders and legal experts on the issue.\n\nOmoworare spoke at a function in Abuja, just as the former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega; Country Representative of Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Adebowale Olorunmola and the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Media, Benjamin Kalu , appealed to Buhari to assent the bill without further delay .\n\nThey spoke at a Policy Dialogue programme, organised by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS).\n\nOmoworare told the gathering that the president was consulting with the Attorney General of the Federation , who is also the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami on the way forward .\n\nHe said, \u201cA very crucial consultation is going on between Mr. President, the Attorney General and other critical stakeholders on content of the bill for the required assent.\n\n\u201cIf not for this programme, I am supposed to be at the very important meeting, believed to be the major determinant for the fate of the bill.\u201d\n\nHe, however, assured Nigerians that the bill would most likely be assented to by the president since issues earlier raised by him in the 2021 edition, were elaborately addressed by both chambers of the National Assembly last month .\n\nHe said, \u201cPersonally, I think in few days\u2019 time , Mr President will do the needful since the most contentious aspect of the bill , had been addressed in the reworked one transmitted to him on Monday , January 31, 2022.\n\n\u201cTime as it is, is of essence but I believe that Mr. President will do the needful,\u201d he said.\n\nMalami also corroborated the submissions of Omoworare as he sent a message to the convener of the dialogue that his planned consultation with Buhari prevented him from attending the event.\n\nThe Director \u2013 General of NILDS, Professor Abubakar Sulaiman, said the Dialogue was convened to gain insights from stakeholders into the issues likely to shape the conduct of political parties, political gladiators, contestants and other issues Addressing the forum, Jega said no law or legislation was perfect and that what was available at the moment was good and manageable for the coming elections.\n\nHowever, the representative of INEC at the discourse , Professor Bolade Eyinla said to avoid the challenge of working on electoral laws at the tail end of conducting elections , INEC should be allowed to drive the process as being done in Ghana .\n\nHe said, \u201cThe situation at hand now is that roughly a year to general election , the anticipated laws are not yet approved , meaning that the extant one will be used aside the fact that the process has not enable INEC to come up with clear cut guidelines for conduct of the elections.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives has clarified that lawmakers in both chambers of the National Assembly, re-amended and passed the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill based on the interest of the general public and not selfish or personal interest.\n\nMalami had during an interview on Channels Television hinted that President Muhammadu Buhari may withhold assent, if the bill was considered to have proposals based on personal interests.\n\nMalami had said: \u201cHonestly, without going through or reading through, I am not in a position to assess whether the bill, indeed, has factored the national and public interest, as against selfish interest, among others; whether it is a bill that can stand the test of constitutionality and legality.\n\n\u201cCertainly, if I am not satisfied and if I am of the opinion that it is against the public interest, the national interest; and then against the dictates of democratic process, I would advise accordingly.\u201d\n\nHowever, addressing journalists, yesterday, spokesman of the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu faulted Malami\u2019s insinuation. He explained that there was nowhere in the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and the House rules where selfish interest was allowed as an instrument to be used in the process lawmaking.\n\nAccording to him, in view of the dynamics of the society, challenges experienced in the country, the 2010 Electoral Act was obsolete and can no longer meet the demands, expectations, ethos and principles of democracy.\n\nHe added that if the nation was serious about advancing democracy, then people should stop playing to the gallery and do what the public interest says.\n\nKalu said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why to advance that particular aspect, the Constitution and House rules made provision for public hearing, for stakeholders\u2019 engagement for memorandum to be sent in, for presentation to be made for town halls. So, these public engagements are not self-serving because not all of them are parliamentarians.\n\n\u201cSome of them are civil society organisations, faith-based organisations, political organisations, traditional organisations, researchers and believers, disciples and advocates of democracy. And there is a thin line running through all their opinion and that thin line is that the 2010 electoral act is obsolete.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is the parliament of the people. Whatever actions that will take, motions that move, resolution we made and bills that we make, we make not as unto ourselves to the exclusion of others, we make it to the generality of Nigerians because for now, we are members of the parliament. Who knows tomorrow, we might be in the executive or even be outside the government.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on if the lawmakers will lobby the President to assent to the Bill, the spokesman said they can\u2019t as they would be interfering in the Executive\u2019s independence as proposed by the constitution.\n\nSunday Aborisade and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Thursday announced a new programme to stimulate the country\u2019s non-oil exports and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three to five years.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme, code-named, \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme),\u201d which takes immediate effect, consists of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.\n\nHe added that the initiative was a product of consultation with the banking community.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja, the CBN governor also announced further extension of all the central bank\u2019s concessionary five per cent interest rate on its intervention facilities till March 1, 2023.\n\nThe CBN had in January 2021, approved an extension on all its facilities by 12 months to March 2022, from the earlier March 2021 expiration date, against the backdrop of the dangers posed by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic businesses.\n\nThe concessions were provided during the first wave of the pandemic as part of measures to cushion its impact on businesses and economy.\n\nThis was as Emefiele further hinted that the central bank may end the sale of FX to banks for the purpose of funding their export bills, adding that the banks would be rather encouraged to generate their export revenue and proceeds.\n\nHe, however, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities\u2019 expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal as well as Biannual non-oil export summit.\n\nEssentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy in FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country\u2019s four major sources of FX inflow namely: proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\u201d\n\nHe said though the $200 billion FX proceeds target appeared unattainable to some, \u201cBut I am resolute and determined that we can achieve it.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor added: \u201cMany countries that are much less endowed than Nigeria are doing it. Consider for example that agriculture exports alone from the Netherlands was about $120 billion last year.\n\n\u201cYet, Netherlands has a land mass of about 42,000 square kilometers, which is much smaller than the land mass of Niger State alone, at over 76,000 square kilometers.\u201d\n\nHe said while the RT200 Programme was not intended to be a silver bullet to all the challenges in the export segment, it remained a first step meant to ensure that the CBN was able to carry out its mandate in an effective and efficient manner, which guarantees preservation of the scarce commonwealth, and the stability of the naira.\n\nEmefiele insisted that, \u201cIt is only by boosting productive and earning capacity of this economy that we can truly preserve the long-term value of our currency, as well as the stability of our exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, while justifying the extension of the concessionary loans, said the impact of the intervention measures helped the country make the fastest recovery from recession ever recorded and changed the trajectory of inflation to an eight-month downward spiral.\n\nHe noted that although interest rates on the CBN\u2019s various intervention facilities were expected to revert to nine per cent effective March 1, 2022, it has been extended to March, 2023.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cWe are announcing that the rates would remain at five per cent for another year in view of the promising trajectory we have established in economic growth and job creation. In effect, the concessionary interest rate of five per cent on our intervention facilities would now be extended until March 1, 2023.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed that the policies and measures adopted by the bank led to a significant improvement in diaspora inflow from an average of $6 million per week in December 2020, to an average of over $100 million per week by January 2022.\n\nCommenting further on plans by the central bank to limit FX sales to banks for exports activities, Emefiele said: \u201cThe banks don\u2019t have a choice, and I said so this morning in the meeting,\n\n\u201cI said the era is coming to an end because when your customers need $100 million, $200 million foreign exchange demand, and so you want to pack all the dollar and pass it to CBN to give you dollar \u2013 that era is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI have told them at the meeting before, that latest end of this year, we would tell them don\u2019t call the central bank for FX again, rather go and generate your export revenue and proceeds.\n\n\u201cFund people who want to generate export proceeds, when those export proceeds come, we would fund them at five per cent for you and they would earn rebate and that\u2019s how we can help you.\n\n\u201cThen, when these proceeds come, sell them to your customers that want $100 million or $200 million. That you will continue to come to central bank to give you dollar, we would stop it. The banks don\u2019t have a choice because it is their bread and butter, right?\u201d\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Debt Sustainability at Risk, Cause for Concern, IMF Says",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability is at risk and causes a great deal of concern and unease in the long-term. IMF reiterated the need for the Nigeria government to implement timely fiscal reforms.\n\nIMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, said these on Thursday, during a virtual media briefing on its Nigeria\u2019s 2021 Article IV Consultation Staff Report.\n\nRahman noted that the increase in public debt had grown rapidly in 10 years and was approaching a time when the country would spend all its income on servicing debts. She stressed the need for urgent fiscal reforms.\n\nRahman explained, \u201cBut what we should remember here and the things that make Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability at risk are the following: we have seen a rapid rise in public debt in the last 10 years or so and this is being driven by fiscal deficits.\n\n\u201cSo, the dynamics is not that great. And there are a couple of other points that we should remember; which is that Nigeria\u2019s debt carrying capacity is very low. For us, revenue levels are low comparing to a typical emerging market country that spends less than 10 per cent of revenues on interest payments.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria\u2019s case, that ratio, if you just take federal government, it\u2019s over 80 per cent of revenues, if you take the consolidated, it is around a third, but the federal government is responsible for paying this debt service. So that\u2019s one point.\n\n\u201cThe second point is on the access side. Market access for Nigeria, that is international market access, like Eurobond, etc., is highly dependent on what happens to oil prices, more so than some other commodity exporters and oil exporters. So that makes Nigeria quite vulnerable.\u201d\n\nRahman said going forward, IMF projected for Nigeria a continuous increase in public debt.\n\n\u201cSo, we are projecting you will see public debt to go up from 36 per cent of GDP to close to 43 per cent of GDP in the medium term,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, it is increasing and it is reaching that level where you should be concerned, everybody should be concerned,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cNigeria has favourable dynamics in the sense that high inflation and low interest rates are keeping these dynamics in favour of Nigeria, right. But if that were to change because growth rates are not high, you could see public debt growing up very fast.\u201d\n\nResponding to a THISDAY inquiry on the impact fuel subsidy removal and value added tax (VAT) would have the masses, Rahman explained that tax reforms were a necessity to boost the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nShe also restated the need for the federal government to remove fuel subsidy, saying it is costly and regressive.\n\nRahman stated, \u201cA country that has little fiscal space to have a subsidy that benefits mostly the rich doesn\u2019t make sense. So, there are economic and social grounds for removing this subsidy.\n\n\u201cOf course, will it impact the poor because it\u2019s a universal subsidy it affects the poor, too. So, removing subsidy would have impact on poverty.\u201d\n\nThe IMF official added, \u201cAnd if you look at Nigeria\u2019s past attempts to remove fuel subsidies, it has always been difficult. But it would be important that in addition to having social assistance, targeted social assistance for the vulnerable and the poor and it also will need strong political will and a well-designed public campaign to demonstrate the merits of this reform and a full transparency in the use of resources. Without this important reform there is risk of reversal again.\u201d\n\nNume Ekeghe",
