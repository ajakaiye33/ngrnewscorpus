Also, it is yet to honour the terms reached at the May 2021 Agreement signed with ASUU.\n\n\u201cIn order to protect the future of our youths whose academic life is being disrupted, we urge the Federal Government to implement all the agreements it entered with ASUU.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we call on government to sign the renegotiated agreement with ASUU.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier directed that a Federal Government team should meet with ASUU to resolve all the outstanding issues.\n\n\u201cWe call on relevant MDAs to ensure that Mr President\u2019s directive is discharged immediately to end the stalemate,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the recent Supreme Court judgment on Executive Order 10, which provides guidelines for the implementation of autonomy for the local government councils, state legislatures and the judiciary, Wabba also urged the FG to respect the judgment.\n\n\u201cWe respect the judgment of the Supreme Court on Executive Order 10, declared by President Muhammadu Buhari to provide guideline for the implementation of the autonomy of local governments, state legislature and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cYet, we are also mindful of the fact that the judgment of the Supreme Court did not impeach the Constitutional provisions prescribing and protecting the autonomy of local governments, state legislature and the Judiciary,\u201d he said..\n\nAccording to him, the NLC wishes to categorically restate its full fledged support for the autonomy of local governments, state houses of assembly and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is our considered view that the autonomy of these critical tiers and arms of government is paramount to our collective commitment to strengthen public institutions for effective delivery of good governance and national development,\u201d he said.\n\nWabba said the congress would continue to clamour for the strengthening of the autonomy of these critical institutions of government in any constitution review and amendment.\n\nHe added that the NLC would also embark on a number of national actions and campaigns to raise public awareness on the issues.\n\n\u201cOur experience since the creation of State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs), is a tale of massive abuse and truncation of free, fair and periodic elections at the local government councils,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerian workers fully support the current electoral act amendment to allow the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to conduct the country\u2019s local government elections.\n\n\u201cWe call on all well-meaning Nigerians, especially members of state houses of assembly, to look beyond partisan interests and support the patriotic move to restore electoral credibility at the grassroots,\u201d Wabba said.\n\nAlso baring his mind on the National Minimum Wage, Wabba said that following a recent agreement with the Kogi State Government, it had started the implementation, only Abia, Cross River, Zamfara and Taraba states were yet to commence implementation.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the affected states commence implementation without further delay, as acting otherwise is tantamount to breaking Nigeria\u2019s law,\u201d the NLC helmsman said.\n\n\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

This ensures that clients will get full value for money. Similarly, PRCAN member-firms will enjoy full institutional support from PRCAN and the NIPR as regulators when these reforms come into effect. The package is a win-win for all,\u201d Opayemi assured.\n\nThe PRCAN President explained that the reforms in the PRCAN Practice Standards 2022 would also help prospective corporate and public sector clients understand the 21 practice areas they can seek professional services from within the circle of legally recognized public relations firms in Nigeria.\n\nHe admonished government and corporate institutes engaging the services of public relations firms to demand their PRCAN membership certificate as a requisite minimum in addition to other prerequisites the PRCAN Practice Standards 2022 will make mandatory for such engagements.\n\nHe noted that as part of the drive towards the effective date of the reforms, the association will engage with relevant industry stakeholders such as the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), the National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria (NIMN), the Advertisers Association of Nigeria (ADVAN), the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), the Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria (AAAN), the Experiential Marketers Association of Nigeria (EXMAN) and the Association of Communications and Marketing Professionals in Banks (ACAMB) to ensure their buy-in as critical stakeholders.\n\nAccording to the report submitted by the Business Transformation Committee of the association, PRCAN is already working on creating a differentiating identity for its members through a sustained campaign to be led by an advocacy committee established for that purpose to differentiate its members from the quacks and interlopers parading themselves as public relations consulting firms in Nigeria.\n\nMembers of the Advocacy committee comprise the Managing Director, Integrated Indigo Limited, Bolaji Abimbola; Chief Executive Officer, Media Range Limited, Hassan Abdul; Chief Executive Officer, Modion Communications, Odion Aleobua; and Lead Strategist, Absolute PR Limited, Akonte Ekine.",

          "title": "Massive Oil Theft, High Pipeline Repairs Cost, Bleeding Nigeria\u2019s Economy",
          "text": "\u2022At 200,000bpd, over $29bn lost to theft in six years\n\n\u2022Over N700bn expended on repairs, maintenance\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA combination of huge oil pipeline repairs cost and a high-level crude oil theft are bleeding the Nigerian economy, with losses amounting to at least $29 billion in the last six years, spanning 2015 to 2021.\n\nIn February last year, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited disclosed that the country lost an average of 200,000 barrels per day of its crude oil production to saboteurs and illegal pilfering by criminals. At the time, the national oil company\u2019s Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, had said, \u201cWe have two sets of losses, one coming from our products and the other coming from crude oil. In terms of crude losses, it is still going on. On average, we are losing 200,000 bpd.\u201d Kyari said this in Abuja during a meeting with Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, to discuss collaborative efforts to curb the menace.\n\nThe amount, as revealed by Kyari, excluded NNPC\u2019s intermittent contracts for the rehabilitation of its downstream facilities, ranging from critical pipelines to depots and terminals, and the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) financing model, of which 96 companies from various jurisdictions indicated interest in 2021.\n\nAt the daily loss of 200, 000 barrels, it would be about 73 million barrels in a year and about 438 million barrels in six years under the current administration, to give roughly $29 billion when calculated over the period.\n\nA THISDAY analysis showed that at a projected 1.86 million barrels per day in 2021, the country recorded nearly 200 million barrels\u2019 crude deficit, out of a possible 700 million barrels yearly, in the first 11 months of the year.\n\nMoreover, statista.com, which tracks oil prices from 1960 till date, put the average price of oil per barrel in 2015 at $49.49, $40.76 in 2016, $52.51 in 2017, $69.78 in 2018, $64.04 in 2019, $41.47 in 2020, and $69.3 in 2021.\n\nUsing a median oil price of $64.5 for the six years multiplied by the 446.4 million barrels lost within the period, Nigeria lost approximately $29 billion in the last six years.\n\nIn 2021 alone, Nigeria was estimated to have lost as much as $4 billion, about 10 per cent of the country\u2019s foreign reserves, to oil theft, and also suffered a double jeopardy of spending its scarce resources on the maintenance of the incessantly breached oil assets.\n\nIn the last couple of months, due to its inability to ramp up production, despite growing international oil price, NNPC was only able to contribute N14 billion, N10.5 billion, and N20 billion, respectively, to the federation account, although it projected N209 billion monthly.\n\nRecently, THISDAY reported that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry had continued to haemorrhage, with the country losing as much as 6.596 million barrels in the December 2021 production circle. At an average of $75 per barrel for last month and a conservative official rate of N415/$1, Nigeria failed to take advantage of high international oil prices for the month, losing a whopping $487.5 million or roughly N202.3 billion.\n\nThe figures from NNPC indicated that the losses were due to a combination of factors, including force majeure declared by a Joint Venture (JV) partner. Other reasons listed by the national oil company included community issues, maintenance work, sabotage, and technical matters, like leakages, pressure build-up, and faulty valves.\n\nLamenting the huge hole the activities of oil thieves was digging in his company\u2019s revenue, Chairman of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu, a few days ago said the company, Heirs Oil and Gas, was losing as much as 50,000 barrels of crude oil to criminals daily. Speaking last week, during a lecture he delivered to members of Course 30 of the National Defence College on the theme, \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d Elumelu described the situation as a national disgrace.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, thieves take 50,000 per day and, to me, this requires a national seminar or dialogue.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it is one of the highest levels of threat to our country because it\u2019s so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate, the country is not safe. They do that to us; they do that to other operators also.\u201d\n\nElumelu added, \u201cWe look forward to men and women in this room who will help remove this national disgrace and problems that we face.\u201d\n\nIn December, according to a THISDAY analysis, some of the assets, which took the greatest hits, included Bonny, which haemorrhaged to the tune of 2.712 million barrels for the month due to the force majeure declared on the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL).\n\nThe Urha terminal followed with 1.468 million barrel losses, which curtailed production within the period, thereby hobbling exports. For context, the loss from that particular terminal exceeded the country\u2019s production for the entire month.\n\nOdudu terminal also suffered the same fate due to decrease in production as a result of maintenance work on the Odudu and Ima terminal.\n\nFurthermore, Forcados shed 456,575 barrels of oil as a result of what NNPC described as community issues delaying reinstatement of the facility.\n\nBesides, Yoho dropped 420,000 barrels during the month owing to a faulty valve, Ajapa lost 30,000 barrels due to shutdown, while Aje terminal curtailed production within the period to the tune of 62,000 barrels.\n\nBrass was not spared as it suffered sabotage around Tebidada and Ogbaibiri flow stations as well as the valve issues, pressure build-up, high sand production, and leak repairs, resulting in a total loss of roughly 198,200 barrels.\n\nLast week, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) lamented that with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quota of 1.683 million bpd in January and 1.701 million bpd in February, Nigeria was only able to pump 1.396 million bpd currently. NUPRC stated that this was leading to a loss of at least 115,926 million bpd, put at roughly $300 million monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are losing about 115, 926 barrels per day, so that literally translates to roughly about $300 million and that\u2019s a huge loss to a nation that actually requires these funds,\u201d the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, stated.\n\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism, as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\n\n\u201cBut the larger percentage is due to crude oil theft and as a commission we know the impact of this and recognising our regulatory role, we have been able to reach out to other operators as to what we can do about this,\u201d he added.\n\nA former Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Waziri Adio, speaking on the matter recently, stressed that since Nigeria first reported oil losses, the situation had escalated and was taking its toll on the country.\n\nIn a period of 10 years, he stated, an analysis by NEITI put losses to oil theft at $41.9 billion, about $4.1 billion per year. He said aside its economic implications the losses also had security ramifications.\n\nAdio said, \u201cThis is something that causes a lot of risks, not just financially but also security wise. There are implications for the environment; there are implications for the Niger Delta, for health and safety.\n\n\u201cMost of the measures that have been put in place are not enough. They are inadequate and actually the problem is getting worse at a time when the country is in a very hard place.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have never had it this bad. Something really is going on. The enforcement of the law is very weak, the surveillance mechanism is weak, the security apparatus is also not clearly focused.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing in terms of technology, we are just scratching the surface. The problem is not new. It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s getting worse and it\u2019s getting worse because we have not done enough to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nBut aside the huge losses to oil theft, there\u2019s also the cost of repairing the lines when they are breached.\n\nLast year, the federal government said, through its spokesman, Mr. Lai Mohammed, that the government was spending N60 billion to repair and maintain vandalised oil and gas pipelines annually.\n\nThe minister, who spoke in July 2021 at a town hall meeting on protecting oil and gas infrastructure in Abuja, said between January 2019 and September 2020, 1,161 pipeline points across the country were vandalised.\n\n\u201cWith an average of 200,000 barrels per day lost to the wanton damage to pipelines and a huge amount of N60 billion yearly to repair and maintain the vandalised points, one can only imagine the impact on the economy,\u201d Mohammed stated.\n\nHowever, THISDAY checks revealed that this figure might be lower than what obtained in reality.\n\nData independently obtained from NNPC indicated that between January and December 2015, N103.4 billion was spent on pipeline repairs and management. From January to August 2015 alone, over 1,824 cases of breaks were reported on the pipelines.\n\nIn all, the government appears helpless, despite attempts in the past to reduce the incidence of vandalism and oil theft.\n\nBefore the Buhari administration, the preceding government had devised a strategy of hiring community members as guards, mostly hiring warlords from the areas who in turn hired those to be deployed at the facilities.\n\nIn 2011, reports said the federal government signed pipeline protection contracts worth at least $39.5 million a year with local guards. But NNPC\u2019s own data indicated that losses actually went up after the new contracts commenced.\n\nBut when Buhari took over, he frowned on the arrangement, put a halt to it, and literally described it as an insult to the Nigerian Armed Forces. He believed it insulted the security services that gang leaders were trusted to secure the country\u2019s assets, despite the existence of the armed forces.\n\nNeither Buhari\u2019s strategy, nor those of the presidents before him has worked.\n\nThe situation worsened in 2016, when the federal government spent N112 billion attempting to fix the problem, rising about N9 billion from the previous year.\n\nIn that year, N14 billion was incurred in February, N14.8 billion in July, and N14.9 billion in August. The lowest amount of N880 million was spent in January before aggrieved Niger Delta militants virtually brought the industry to its knees.\n\nAt least 2,560 vandalised points were recorded between January and December of that year. A check further showed that in 2017, N129.87 billion was spent on the phenomenon, while N137.44 billion was expended in 2018. But in 2019, the cost was reported as N127 billion.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the cost of repairs reduced considerably to N60.5 billion, and further fell to 29.5 billion in 2021, the least spending in years. The fall in the cost of repairs may not be unconnected with the fact that many of the pipes have now been abandoned.\n\nWhile oil theft is not a new phenomenon, with countries like Ghana, Morocco, Uganda, Mozambique, Mexico, Thailand, Azerbaijan, and Turkey experiencing different levels of theft, the volumes from Nigeria remain incredibly high.\n\nFor instance, while the stealing of oil across the global industry averaged 70,000 bpd of crude output in August 2020, Nigeria experienced significantly higher losses, with theft estimated at 200,000 barrels per day.\n\nHowever, it is believed that access to oil pipelines in Nigeria is markedly easier due to alleged connivance of top security operatives, ageing infrastructure, community acquiescence, as well as a complex web of complicity by contractors and oil companies\u2019 staff who gain when the pipelines are breached.\n\nWhile it is difficult to establish what happens on the high seas, where vessels allegedly load crude oil without requisite papers under the watchful eyes of the security operatives, those in the know insist that the high volume of the commodity moved out of the Niger Delta illegally would not be possible without connivance from top security agents.\n\nLeader of the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA) and a coalition of nine other militant groups in the Niger Delta, self-styled Johnmark Ezon-Ebi, in a chat with THISDAY earlier had alleged that high-ranking officials of government and security agencies were the major illegal oil \u2018bunkerers\u2019, who stole crude oil from Niger Delta and sold overseas through proxies.\n\nAn activist and National President of Ijaw Peoples Development Initiative (IPDI), Austin Ozobo, corroborated the claim and gave an insight into how the different categories of oil thieves in the region operated and settled security agents on the waterways.\n\nA legal practitioner and former President of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, said the connivance of security agents was well known. He added that his concerns were the effect of oil bunkering on the environment and the fact that due to joblessness, graduates had joined the oil bunkering business.\n\nIn the same vein, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State had also accused a serving General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division of the Nigerian Army of promoting oil theft in the Niger Delta.\n\nIn November last year, Wike again doubled down on the matter, alleging that the fight to stop oil theft had continued to fail because top-ranking military officers were involved.\n\nSince this year, Wike has repeatedly accused the Nigeria Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) of connivance. In one instance, the governor alleged that a Divisional Police Officer (DPO) actually owned one of the illegal refineries in the state.\n\nIn 2018, an indigenous oil company, Aiteo, took the unprecedented step of raising the alarm about security forces involvement in illegal oil bunkering and breaking of pipelines. It accused a then Joint Task Force (JTF) operating in the region of complicity.\n\nThese cases either went without investigation or the outcome of the investigations were not made public. However, the security forces have always denied involvement.\n\nNigeria has been unable to meet its allocation by OPEC, which was 1.68 million bpd for January 2022 and 1.701 million barrels per day for February, and barely exceeded 1.25 million bpd in the last few months.\n\nAlthough questions remain over the real motives for planning to exit their onshore and shallow water operations, a handful of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria have cited costs related to oil pipelines and general insecurity as reasons for their actions.\n\nFigures from NNPC indicated that the country lost 42.25 million barrels in 2019, and 53.28 million barrels in the year prior, owing to oil theft, but the situation might have worsened in 2021.\n\nNEITI, the country\u2019s oil industry auditor, in 2019, suggested the country had lost around 138,000 bpd of crude to theft over the previous decade, at a value of around $40.06 billion.\n\nDespite several efforts, including the setting up of a special security outfit, Operation Delta Safe, a coalition of all the security agencies in the country, and the establishment of several committees, including the one for recovery of crude oil and illegally refined petroleum products, the results have been largely negative.\n\nIn response to a query raised in a 2016 report of the Auditor General for the Federation (AuGF), NNPC had put the money spent on pipeline repairs within five years as well as the money lost as a result of product losses at N966 billion. The corporation said the N966 billion expenses and losses were incurred between 2010 and 2015.\n\nBut a senate panel had insisted on probing NNPC for an alleged failure to remit N4 trillion into the federation account as contained in the AuGF report.\n\n\u201cAside the above, pipeline repairs and products losses so incurred stood at N966 billion for the same period,\u201d it stated in the defence.\n\nIn June last year, NNPC began collaborating with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Police, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), and NSCDC to try to curb the menace. That move has also been largely unfruitful.\n\nBut NNPC has always insisted that working with the local communities would be one of the most effective ways to halt the theft of crude oil and vandalism of the country\u2019s pipelines.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is continuously working in collaboration with the local communities and other stakeholders to reduce and eventually eliminate the pipeline vandalism menace,\u201d the company said in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR).\n\nHowever, a Pricewaterhouse Coopers forensic audit, which reviewed and analysed pipeline repairs spending claimed by NNPC found that most of the expenses were \u201cunsubstantiated costs\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "A THISDAY analysis showed that at a projected 1.86 million barrels per day in 2021, the country recorded nearly 200 million barrels\u2019 crude deficit, out of a possible 700 million barrels yearly, in the first 11 months of the year.\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism, as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\nIn a period of 10 years, he stated, an analysis by NEITI put losses to oil theft at $41.9 billion, about $4.1 billion per year.\nIn all, the government appears helpless, despite attempts in the past to reduce the incidence of vandalism and oil theft.\nSince this year, Wike has repeatedly accused the Nigeria Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) of connivance.",

          "text": "\u2022Sends N2.557trn supplementary budget for petrol subsidy \u2022Asks Senate to amend 2022 Appropriation Act\n\nSunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akojie in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday criticised the National Assembly for removing crucial projects from the 2022 budget estimates sent to it by the executive and inserting the lawmakers\u2019 projects to the tune of N887 billion in the fiscal document before it was signed into law.\n\nHe also accused the federal lawmakers of making unnecessary incursion into the operational areas of the executive.\n\nThis was just as the president has asked the National Assembly to amend the 2022 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly in December, 2021.\n\nThe requests were contained in a letter dated February 10, 2022, and read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari in the letter, he also said it was imperative to remove all capital projects that were replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nHe lamented that 139 out of the 254 projects in the budget totaling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe president, therefore, requested the National Assembly to amend the Appropriation Act to provide for capital expenditure in the sum of N106,161,499,052 billion; and N43,870,592,044 billion for recurrent expenditure.\n\nHe also requested that an additional provision for N2.557 trillion be appropriated by the National Assembly to fund the petrol subsidy in the 2022 budget framework which was revised to provide fully for PMS subsidy.\n\nBuhari stressed the need to reinstate four capital projects totaling N1.4 billion in the executive proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources.\n\nHe said N22 billion should be cut from the provision for the Sinking Fund to retire mature loans needed to meet government\u2019s obligations under already Issued Bonds.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totaling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision (see Schedule l).\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative to reinstate the N22 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital projects that are replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act. 139 out of the 254 such projects totaling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSome significant and non-mandate projects were introduced in the budgets of the Ministry of Transportation, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation\n\n\u201cThere are several other projects that have been included by the National Assembly in the budgets of agencies that are outside their mandate areas.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning has been directed to work with your relevant Committees to comprehensively identify and realign all such misplaced projects.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to restore the titles / descriptions of 32 projects in the Appropriation Act to the titles contained in the Executive Proposal for the Ministry of Water Resources (see Schedule IV) in furtherance of our efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects.\n\nThe president also sought the approval of the federal parliament for a fresh request of N150 billion.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding Local Contractors\u2019 Debts and Other Liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth.\u201d\n\nThe president said the N2.557 trillion fresh requests was to enable the federal government to subsidise petrol from June to December this year.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the suspension of the petrol subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy.\n\n\u201cAn additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2 trillion while FGN\u2019s share from the account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the amount available to fund the federal budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I. Chikere on November 29, 2021, ordered the DSS to release him after he was abducted by the service and detained illegally, but the service flagrantly disobeyed the order.\n\nNtari's lawyer, P. D.

He also attached a copy of the release order.\n\nBut in his response to the letter, the Chief of Staff claimed that the Nigerian Army was never a party to the case before the Federal High Court and that such an order was not binding on the army as non-party to the action.\n\n",

Crucially, this applies not only to people playing games, but also those willing to pay as well,\u201d said Carry1st CEO and Co-founder, Cordel Robbin-Coker.\n\nCrypto adoption and gaming in Africa\n\nAlready, 63 million of the 186 million gamers, pay for games with these African figures projected to be the fastest-growing in the world as the continent also begins adoption of digital currencies.\n\nAnother research by Newswagg\u2019s points to a growing appetite for trading in gaming assets using digital currencies with 38 percent of 41.9 million gamers owning crypto across the world being millennials aged 21-38 years old.\n\nAfrica and the Middle East have a combined 5.9 million gamers owning Crypto, with a potential to shore up these numbers in Africa given that the continent will have one of the largest youthful populations by 2050.\n\nAccording to Newswagg\u2019s, 80 percent gamers with crypto accounts are interested in using digital currency for gaming purchases, with 67 percent yearning for an opportunity to use cryptocurrency in gaming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an immense potential for crypto to be more involved in the gaming industry,\u201d says the report.\n\nGlobal crypto gaming was valued at 321 million US dollars in 2020.\n\nNigeria has leaped ahead of its African peers in adoption of cryptocurrencies following the launch of Africa\u2019s first Central Bank-backed digital currency- the e-Naira in 2021.\n\nWhile Kenya is yet to launch its own regulated digital currency, it tops the world in peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trade.\n\nSouth Africa is currently in the piloting stage of its project, Dunbar- that will support cross border payments with Mauritius getting closer to piloting now in the development stage.\n\nSix other African countries including Tunisia, Ghana and Morocco are still conducting research on regulated digital currencies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside NVIDIA plans to develop Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem",
          "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies have the potential to inspire growth and solve problems in Africa, yet Africa still struggles to get itself into the conversation.\n\nThis is concerning because AI relies on data, and when the appropriate social, cultural, and political contexts are not provided, it can entrench existing inequalities, prejudices, and injustices. For example, a paper written by computer scientists, Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini showed how facial recognition software was less accurate when identifying women and people of colour compared to white men.\n\nAccording to Tortoise Intelligence, globally, AI companies attracted $77.5 billion investment last year, a 115% increase from the $36 billion recorded in the year before that. This represents the growing interest in AI from investors and governments, which can be traced from COVID-19, the report noted. But, in Africa, a large part of the ecosystem\u2019s investments is concentrated in very few startups. In 2019, Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem raised $11.27 million\u2014up by 223% from the $3.6 million in 2018\u2014and Tunisia\u2019s InstaDeep $7 million raise represents 62% of the total investment made that year in the ecosystem. Similarly, in 2020, South Africa\u2019s DataProphet $6 million accounted for half of the $11.63 million raised, solidifying South Africa as the hub of AI development on the continent.\n\nMichael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, explained that a sudden need for digital collaborative spaces and remote working tools during the pandemic forced business leaders to understand the need for digitisation, and this demand included further investments in AI and automation. Unsurprisingly, a CNBC survey revealed that 81% of executives worldwide believe AI will play a prominent and critical role in how their business operates this year.\n\nLast month, all eyes were on Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem when Tunisian AI startup InstaDeep, which helps companies create decision making systems for solving real-world problems, raised a $100 million Series B funding, the biggest raise by an AI startup on the continent\u2014or by any startup from the region. InstaDeep was founded in 2014 by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim and bootstrapped until it received external funding in 2018.\n\nBut before then, in 2017, the startup joined NVIDIA\u2019s Inception Programme, a global programme designed to nurture AI and data science startups, as a Premier member. Through this programme, InstaDeep was able to buy its first NVIDIA DGX Station, an AI system that brings AI supercomputing to data science teams. The programme provided InstaDeep with marketing and technical support and introductions to help grow its network.\n\nFocus on Africa\n\nNVIDIA is one of the biggest chip makers in the world and is best known for its unique line of graphics processing units (GPU)\u2014a single-chip processor that handles mathematically intensive tasks in parallel, rather than serially, the way a CPU does. NVIDIA is also one of the leaders in deep learning, a key process to develop AI applications, and for years have supported AI developers with training, with, for example, its Deep Learning Institute, which offers learning resources that help individuals, teams, educators, students, and organisations advance their knowledge on AI.\n\nThe GPUs that NVIDIA creates were initially used to process pixels for 3D graphics, but in the last decade, because of its adept ability at processing data, it has become a tool AI researchers use for deep learning. Fast forward to today, NVIDIA has grown to become the pioneer of the modern AI, deep learning, and machine learning market. It allows developers, researchers, and scientists around the world to build applications for accelerated computing on top of its platform, including in Africa.\n\nNVIDIA expressed intentions to intensify its support for the African AI ecosystem when it hired Fatima Tambajang as its Head of Developer Relations for Africa. \u201cAfrica is a hugely important market for NVIDIA, which is why we are working within its developer ecosystem,\u201d NVIDIA said in an email.\n\nKate Kallot, Head of Emerging Areas, speaking about NVIDIA\u2019s work on the continent during last year\u2019s AI Expo, highlighted the work another Inception Programme member, South African AI startup, Aerobotics, is doing to help farmers protect their crops and maximise yields. Kallot revealed that Aerobotics has processed over 100 million trees across nearly 20 countries. The Inception Programme has also helped ATLAN Space create an AI-powered drone that scans thousands of square miles of ocean and detects illegal fishing boats and other environmental threats.\n\nKallot explained that in the US, AI and data science innovation are driven by Big Tech; in China, they are driven by government investments; and in Europe, it is by individual laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In Africa, however, none of this applies: innovation is driven by individual developers, grassroots communities, and startups.\n\nThis is why NVIDIA is taking a different approach to engage with Africa\u2019s AI ecosystem. Last year, NVIDIA launched the Emerging Chapters Programme\u2014specifically for Africa but is now expanding to other emerging markets\u2014to help these grassroots communities build and scale their AI and data science projects. NVIDIA partners with non-traditional pathway institutions and communities like Zindi, AI Centre of Excellence Kenya, and Data Science Nigeria.\n\nWhile these AI communities consist of individual developers, run their incubators, do their own AI research, and partner with the government and international organisations, NVIDIA provides them with workshops from its AI experts through the Deep Learning Institute Programme and ships its hardware to them.\n\n\u200bCiting an example of the progress the Emerging Chapter Programme has made, Kallot referred to Clinton Oduor, a computer science student at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (Dekut), who started as an AI and data science hobbyist but now leads the innovative tinyML Kenya community. Oduor and his team have built Makini, an offline learning device that uses speech to bring education to vulnerable children in remote areas through an interactive session at a low cost.\n\nA few years ago, in 2019, tech giant Google opened its first AI centre in Africa in Ghana\u2019s capital city, Accra. And now we have the trio of NVIDIA programmes: Inception, Deep Learning Institute, and Emerging Chapter working hand in hand to aid AI development in Africa. Consulting firm PwC estimates AI and related technologies will add more than $15 trillion to the global GDP by 2030. Currently, Africa is playing catch up in the AI space, so NVIDIA\u2019s investments are a welcome development to the ecosystem.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Is Africa\u2019s tech startup ecosystem set for a debt financing boom?",
          "text": "Last year, 37 African tech startups raised a total of $767 million in 43 debt rounds, indicating the rise of the debt funding class and increasing global lender confidence in African tech, per Partech\u2019s report on venture capital funding in Africa.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s tech ecosystem has set its sights on another asset class to help fuel growth,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWhile debt funding remains widely underreported and undisclosed, it is growing to prominence in the fundraising strategy of African startups.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Partech will be reporting on debt in its annual report. According to its findings, Nigerian startups raised 45% or $345 million of the total amount of debt recorded, the fintech sector accounted for over 54%, and there were 34 unique debt investors, with Lendable and the IFC being some of the most active.\n\n\u201cAs the [African tech startup] ecosystem matures, more companies will do a combination of debt and equity [funding rounds],\u201d said Dare Okoudjou, CEO and founder of MFS Africa in October 2021. Okoudjou\u2019s statement came after the pan-African fintech giant closed a $100 million Series C financing round\u2014split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt.\n\nMost startups looking to raise money during their formative years typically consider equity, which requires that founders give away shares in their business in exchange for capital. At that stage, the venture is extremely risky and thus doesn\u2019t appeal to most financing options (like debt that requires repayment at an agreed-upon date with interest) except venture capital.\n\n\u201cDebt investors usually look for predictable cash flows or transferable assets (such as real estate) to secure their exposures. For most startups, both of these are in short supply,\u201d Rahul Shah, Head of Financials Equity Research at Tellimer, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nBecause the majority of startups are early-stage, debt takes up a small slice of the broader market for private tech financing. According to Ayobamigbe Teriba, an ex-analyst at Ingressive Capital, debt financing is viable to businesses but tricky.\n\n\u201cA lot of [early-stage] companies don\u2019t consider it [debt] because of the criteria tied to accessing them, which is different from equity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it allows founders retain ownership, access criteria can be more tedious than equity funding that\u2019s been the anchor in the ecosystem and is based on stages of the startups.\u201d\n\nBut as an ecosystem matures and growing startups choose to stay private longer, funding alternatives like debt become viable and interest grows. \u201cAs startups grow and achieve some predictability, debt financing can be a useful instrument,\u201d the Partech report notes. \u201cIt helps accelerate growth while limiting dilution from equity rounds.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThere\u2019s no available data on how much debt African startups have attracted over the years. But several funding announcements last year\u2014when Africa\u2019s venture capital funding hit the $5 billion mark\u2014suggest 2021 saw an acceleration in serious appetite for debt financing. Apart from MFS Africa, Moove, Trella, and TradeDepot are some of the startups that announced debt rounds.\n\nBecause the ecosystem is at a stage where further financing is needed by many fast-growing startups, more debt financing announcements should be expected this year, predicts Kunle Akinola, an investment analyst at Lagos-based private equity firm Platform Capital.\n\n\u201cAfrica minted 5 new unicorns in 2021, which indicates growth. As a founder of one of these or another growth-stage company, you probably don\u2019t want to be issuing equity unnecessarily to finance acquisitions or capital expenses during growth and expansion,\u201d Akinola said.\n\nThe Partech report notes, In addition, that strategic debt players have launched dedicated debt funds targeted to emerging markets \u2013 Africa in particular.\n\nLast October, emerging markets-focused lender Lendable announced a plan to raise a $100 million fund targeting African and Asian fintech companies. It participated in MFS Africa\u2019s $100 million funding round with $30 million debt and has backed many startups in Africa.\n\nDevelopment finance institutions like the United Kingdom\u2019s CDC, the Dutch development bank, and the IFC are also leaders in this financing segment. The latter has so far deployed debt to back TradeDepot, Bolt, Kobo360, etc. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see a major uptick in the deployment of debt by existing players and new entrants,\u201d Teriba said.\n\nWith the growing uptick in debt funding activity in Africa, which companies are best suited for the financing option?\n\nPer Rahul Shah, industries with debt-friendly assets or business models have a better chance of accessing this financing source. \u201cFor example, financial companies looking to fund their lending, particularly where they can point to strong risk management to reduce the uncertainty in repayment cashflows,\u201d he said.\n\nIn MFS Africa\u2019s case, it raised debt funding to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements. \u201cWe realized we don\u2019t need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that,\u201d the CEO said at the time.\n\nAnother emerging sector with access to debt financing is renewable energy: physical infrastructure (such as solar panels) and supply contracts can give debt investors the comfort that they will be repaid. In this space, West Africa-focused solar providers like Starsight and Daystar Power have largely leveraged debt to fund operations.\n\n\u201cIn such cases, debt financing can make more sense than equity financing; asset and liability cash flows are better-matched, and returns to equity-holders can be enhanced,\u201d the Tellimer head said.\n\nShort-term debt financing can also be accessed if it is backed by inventory; for example, e-commerce retailers and their suppliers. In contrast, companies with non-transferable intangible assets (such as early-stage biotech) would likely struggle to obtain debt finance.\n\nEssentially, debt is hinged on the cash flow or revenue models of companies. Once the models become reliable and the product-market fit is underlined, debt investors become more open to funding a startup.\n\nBased on the ongoing trend, Africa is poised to witness a surge in founders seeking debt financing for their startups in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe are starting from a very low base; in that sense, volumes can only increase from here,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAs the current cadre of African startups matures, they will become more attractive to debt investors given they have demonstrable track records. And as the continent\u2019s startup debt investors become more experienced, their risk appetite will improve.\u201d\n\nTeriba adds that more startups are likely to engage capital markets, institutional lenders for credit to \u201cexpand and stabilise their business offerings.\u201d\n\nWhile the near-term growth prospects are strong, a key medium-term headwind is the global monetary tightening cycle as developed countries, where the bulk of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from, roll back monetary measures meant to help businesses tide over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe era of cheap and plentiful money is coming to an end, and that will ultimately constrain end-investor appetite for the riskiest forms of debt,\u201d Shah added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nSo, anyone familiar with tertiary education in Nigeria knows about the striking tradition. Most government-run university students have lost blocks of time due to strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Under President Buhari\u2019s administration, students have lost 13 months to strikes.\n\nThere seems to be no respite in sight, and this week, the body declared a \u201ccomprehensive and total\u201d four-week strike. In a separate development, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, is embroiled in a dispute with ASUU over its decision to make Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Communication, Isa Pantami, a professor.\n\nWhile we hope that the strike ends quickly, we encourage students to use any opportunity to gain relevant skills while waiting for the strike to be called off. While you\u2019re here, we\u2019d appreciate it if you could take a minute to share this newsletter with at least three people on your contact list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The newsletter edition dated February 15, 2022, erroneously reported that the European Union plans to invest $927 billion under its global gateway initiative. The correct figure is $927 million.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest:\n\nLocal competition for Uber\n\nWasla\u2019s $9 million raise\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\nLocal competition for Uber?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos is famous for many things. From its entrepreneurial spirit to dare-devil danfo drivers who will test your patience. But perhaps, its most notable feature is its traffic.\n\nWhile the British use the weather as a conversation starter, Nigerians use Lagos traffic to start conversations.\n\nLike any problem, the traffic situation has led various entrepreneurs to build solutions with local startups like Treepz, Touch and Pay, and Shuttlers joining foreign brands like Uber and Bolt to provide convenient transportation solutions.\n\nOne local player is Transtura, a mobility startup founded by Vincent Adeoba that provides a convenient mode of transportation using shuttle minibuses. What began from renting out his car to be used on Uber has grown into a startup serving 2,500 users. However, the company has not stopped there, recently acquiring W\u00e0z\u00f3 as it plans to roll out payment solutions.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo had a chat with the founders a few weeks ago, where they shared insights from their journey and plans for the future. You can read more about that here: Transtura\u2019s journey to digital payments; from launch to acquisition\n\nWasla bags $9 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Egyptian eCommerce companies burst onto the scene bagging huge investment rounds aided by rising Internet penetration rates and digitally savvy millennials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWasla is one of such startups, founded in 2018 by Serag Meneassy, Taymour Sabry, and Mahmoud El-Said. The startup has announced an investment of $9 million from Contact Financial Holding, a financial services provider in Egypt.\n\nThe startup offers its users a wide array of services enabling them to save while shopping. These services include a deal finder and cashback points that can be used for airtime and gift cards. Following the fresh injection of capital, the startup plans to introduce buy now, pay later options and a new online payment option for its users.\n\nWith 1.5 million downloads, Wasla is eyeing regional expansion with plans to expand to Nigeria. Speaking to TechCrunch, CEO El-Said said, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market at the end of the day, you have roughly 250 million people. They\u2019re very technologically advanced, and their adoption of eCommerce is quite good.\u201d\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccepting payments is a significant challenge for businesses across the globe. With several payment providers, it is often difficult to harmonise a business\u2019 payment stack. In Europe and America, payment orchestration platforms have been built, providing a faster way for businesses to receive payments and easing the expansion process.\n\nMoneyHash, an Egyptian startup, has raised $3 million in pre-seed funding for this purpose after launching in 2021. The startup, which claims to be the first payment orchestration and revenue operations platform in the Middle East/Africa, raised its pre-seed round from investors including Nuwa Capital, First Check Africa, VentureSouq, VentureFriends, and angel investors like NerdWallet Co-founders, Tim Chen and Jake Gibson and Belvo Co-founder, Oriol Tintore.\n\nFounded by Nadir Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash is currently testing its product with 17 companies, five of which are active and paying companies. It charges these companies between $150 and $1,000 with transaction fees starting from 10 cents and reducing as payment volume increases.\n\nCurrently operating in Egypt, the company intends to use its pre-seed funding to drive growth across the Middle East and Africa as it aims to become the AWS of payments in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cWhat AWS did to the cloud, where it made it easy for companies to build as many services on top of the infrastructure, we think the payment industry, especially in emerging markets, is very fragmented and needs an AWS for money, which MoneyHash is doing when you connect with it and build as much as you need without needing to change anything,\u201d CEO Abdelrazik said in a chat with TechCrunch.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nCrime and NFTs: Chainalysis Detects Significant Wash Trading and Some Money Laundering In this Emerging Asset Class\n\nNigeria\u2019s sleepless students trying to beat the Lagos traffic\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a productive day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "How Healthdart is providing affordable and accessible healthcare in South Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from education, there is probably no other industry that contributes as much to the development of a society like healthcare. Unhealthy individuals can\u2019t build businesses, fight for good governance, or create life-changing innovations. So it\u2019s no surprise that some of the poorest countries in the world have the worst quality of healthcare.\n\nBefore it was stopped in 2000, the highest-ranked African country in the World Health Organization\u2019s health system rankings was Morocco in 29th position. Tunisia, the next in the continent, was in 52nd place. Not much has changed in the 21 years since. A report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) described healthcare in Africa as the worst globally, with 50% of healthcare expenditure out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMuch like the education sector, developments in Africa\u2019s healthcare space are driven by the private sector as underfunded public health facilities struggle to meet demand. In South Africa, one healthtech startup is helping South Africans access drugs and health advice using their phones. I sat down with one of the startup\u2019s co-founders \u2013 Healthdart \u2013 to learn more about its operations.\n\nMission-driven entrepreneurship\n\nIn the early 2000s, South Africa had an HIV crisis on its hands. About to get into the university, Njabulo Skhosana decided to study pharmacology at the University of Liverpool. The plan was to learn how he could help stem the tide, but he took a different route with stints at Bupa, Deloitte, and Discovery Health. The one constant thing in all these jobs was healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2020, just a few weeks after the government imposed lockdowns in South Africa, he quit his job as the Chief of Staff to the CEO at Discovery Health to build Healthdart \u2013 a one-stop-shop for primary health care services.\n\nBringing primary health care closer to the people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart co-founders, L-R, Yauvan Hansraj (CTO), Njabulo Skhosana (CEO), and Tshwanelo Matsane (CPO). Source: Healthdart\n\nMost plans to improve healthcare in Africa are focused on secondary care, with primary healthcare often an afterthought. As a result, most Africans ignore symptoms of ill health until they get really serious. The disadvantage of this approach is that conditions that could have been prevented or treated early may now be too advanced for the patient to get help.\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution uses an app to provide a platform where users can place orders for their drugs and have them delivered at less than the cost of the cheapest two-way bus ride (R30 or $1.99) in South African townships. Customers can choose to pay using electronic funds transfer before they receive the drugs or at the point of exchange using a card or cash.\n\nOne might ask what is so special about providing an avenue for patients to order and have their drugs delivered to them where they choose. Let me paint a picture. Imagine that you had a cold and got a prescription from a doctor; however, you have to journey to the nearest pharmacy to get the medication because there are no pharmacies close to you.\n\nAssuming you had a job and this happened during the week, you would have to take some time off from work to get your prescription. If you\u2019re fortunate, you could get your boss to give you the time you need. Yet, even with permission, people living in South Africa\u2019s townships have to take long and often stressful journeys without an assurance that they will get the drugs they need.\n\nAnd this is where Healthdart steps in. The startup does not just deliver drugs to patients; it also facilitates virtual and physical consultations with doctors and nurses. Consequently, the startup can provide comprehensive access to primary health care services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart delivers its solution via an app and yet targets middle-income neighbourhoods. With less disposable income, this society is less likely to have a smartphone, and I was curious to know how Healthdart intends to reach them.\n\n\u201cI think if you asked me that question five years ago, we would not have been able to start the business. Right now, we find that people can get basic android phones at low prices within the South African market,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis reply corresponds to a 2020 report from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) that claims that the smartphone penetration in South Africa stands at ~91%. Even with that, the startup ensures that at 17 megabytes, the app is light enough to run on low-end smartphones while it uses WhatsApp to complement its customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution is not novel, and there are startups across Africa that either offer a platform for patients to order drugs or speak with a physician. Still, Skhosana argues that Healthdart provides more than convenience to its customers.\n\n\u201cA huge part of our value proposition is reducing the total cost of care, and that is very different from what our competitors do. In most cases, the focus is on convenience, almost like trying to create an UberEats for medicine. But we see our role as a lot more integral to the person\u2019s lifestyle and just trying to make it as easy and affordable as possible for them to access the right level of healthcare that they need.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\nSince its launch, Healthdart has primarily focused on a few South African townships. However, it plans to add more townships and cities to the areas it currently covers before exploring possible expansion options. In this time, the startup has facilitated more than 1,000 medication orders and health consultations across Johannesburg.\n\nInitially incubated in the Founders Factory Africa, it has also raised money from BFA Global\u2019s Catalyst Fund as it moves towards building a one-stop-shop for primary healthcare service in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "The economics of 5G deployment in Nigeria",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 140 million internet subscribers have mostly conducted their online business on microwave internet or 2G and 3G networks. The country has higher coverage of both networks with 2G at over 70 percent and 3G at 50 percent.\n\nCompared to 4G and 5G networks, the speeds of these networks are exceptionally slow. The average speed of 3G connections is 3 megabits per second (Mbps), which is 30 times faster than the 2G average speed of 100 kilobits per second (or 0.1 Mbps). Some connections could achieve speeds of 7Mbps.\n\nNevertheless, they work quite well with VoIP, video conferencing, web browsing, office 365, and any other specialist software. And their ease of deployment, suitability to different terrains ensuring they reach the last mile, and lower cost compared to 4G and 5G, make them attractive for many operators.\n\nTheir attractiveness, however, pales in comparison to the speeds of 4G and 5G networks. To put it in context, it would take roughly 40 minutes on 4G to download two full seasons of The Office, which is 5GB in size. It would take over 2 hours to download on 3G. 5G reduced the time it would take to download the same seasons to a mere 35 seconds.\n\n4G boasts peak speeds clocking in at 150Mbps upload and 50Mbps download speeds. These are vast improvements over 3G, yet Nigeria has yet to realise the full potential of 4G which only has 37 percent coverage in the country.\n\nBut the attention of the NCC is already turning to 5G deployment, which the auction concluded in December, and winners are expected to complete payment in February 2022.\n\nInasmuch as 5G holds more promise for internet speeds and service, the economics of deploying the technology is steep for operators in a country where previous networks generations have yet to gain wide penetration.\n\nHere are six areas that could present the most cost challenge identified by researchers at Advocaat, a legal services firm.\n\nInadequate fibre optic infrastructure\n\nThere are five subsea cables that have landed on Nigerian shores. These include MainOne (10Tb), SAT3/SAFE (800Gb); Glo1 (2.5Tb), ACE (5Tb), and WACS (14.5Tb) with a combined capacity of 32.800Tbps. While Nigeria expects these assets to provide high-speed internet to the country, only about 10 percent of the capacity has been utilised.\n\nMost of the country\u2019s internet needs are served by mobile broadband, which is the marketing term for wireless internet access through a portable modem, mobile phone, USB wireless modem, table, or other mobile devices. 2G and 3G services are mainly provided through mobile broadband. Fixed broadband which is through fibre optic cable remains at a very low level of deployment.\n\nIt is estimated that to achieve full broadband penetration, 120,000km of fibre needs to be installed, given Nigeria\u2019s landmass. Nigeria reportedly has a deficit of about 80,000km of fibre which needs to be met before effective nationwide deployment of broadband can be achieved. The operators also suffer vandalism and damage to existing fibre infrastructure from road construction.\n\nDevice availability and affordability\n\nThe 5G network cannot work on any mobile device. The first all-5G smartphones to come out in 2020 \u2013 Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S20 lineup \u2014 starting at $1,000. To compare, 2019\u2019s lineup of premium 4G smartphones started at $750 with the Galaxy S10e.\n\nThe high cost of 4G devices has played a role in why its coverage is not widespread in the country and this could be the case for 5G networks. In 2018, Ntel, a full 4G operator identified devices as the biggest problem to the adoption of the network. According to the operator, 4G is operated in over 4G sub-bands and there are fewer devices operating in the bands; and they are much more expensive.\n\nInstability in the FX market\n\nThe 5G operators in Nigeria would face a big cost hurdle while trying to navigate the foreign exchange market in Nigeria.

          "title": "The economics of 5G deployment in Nigeria",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 140 million internet subscribers have mostly conducted their online business on microwave internet or 2G and 3G networks. The country has higher coverage of both networks with 2G at over 70 percent and 3G at 50 percent.\n\nCompared to 4G and 5G networks, the speeds of these networks are exceptionally slow. The average speed of 3G connections is 3 megabits per second (Mbps), which is 30 times faster than the 2G average speed of 100 kilobits per second (or 0.1 Mbps). Some connections could achieve speeds of 7Mbps.\n\nNevertheless, they work quite well with VoIP, video conferencing, web browsing, office 365, and any other specialist software. And their ease of deployment, suitability to different terrains ensuring they reach the last mile, and lower cost compared to 4G and 5G, make them attractive for many operators.\n\nTheir attractiveness, however, pales in comparison to the speeds of 4G and 5G networks. To put it in context, it would take roughly 40 minutes on 4G to download two full seasons of The Office, which is 5GB in size. It would take over 2 hours to download on 3G. 5G reduced the time it would take to download the same seasons to a mere 35 seconds.\n\n4G boasts peak speeds clocking in at 150Mbps upload and 50Mbps download speeds. These are vast improvements over 3G, yet Nigeria has yet to realise the full potential of 4G which only has 37 percent coverage in the country.\n\nBut the attention of the NCC is already turning to 5G deployment, which the auction concluded in December, and winners are expected to complete payment in February 2022.\n\nInasmuch as 5G holds more promise for internet speeds and service, the economics of deploying the technology is steep for operators in a country where previous networks generations have yet to gain wide penetration.\n\nHere are six areas that could present the most cost challenge identified by researchers at Advocaat, a legal services firm.\n\nInadequate fibre optic infrastructure\n\nThere are five subsea cables that have landed on Nigerian shores. These include MainOne (10Tb), SAT3/SAFE (800Gb); Glo1 (2.5Tb), ACE (5Tb), and WACS (14.5Tb) with a combined capacity of 32.800Tbps. While Nigeria expects these assets to provide high-speed internet to the country, only about 10 percent of the capacity has been utilised.\n\nMost of the country\u2019s internet needs are served by mobile broadband, which is the marketing term for wireless internet access through a portable modem, mobile phone, USB wireless modem, table, or other mobile devices. 2G and 3G services are mainly provided through mobile broadband. Fixed broadband which is through fibre optic cable remains at a very low level of deployment.\n\nIt is estimated that to achieve full broadband penetration, 120,000km of fibre needs to be installed, given Nigeria\u2019s landmass. Nigeria reportedly has a deficit of about 80,000km of fibre which needs to be met before effective nationwide deployment of broadband can be achieved. The operators also suffer vandalism and damage to existing fibre infrastructure from road construction.\n\nDevice availability and affordability\n\nThe 5G network cannot work on any mobile device. The first all-5G smartphones to come out in 2020 \u2013 Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S20 lineup \u2014 starting at $1,000. To compare, 2019\u2019s lineup of premium 4G smartphones started at $750 with the Galaxy S10e.\n\nThe high cost of 4G devices has played a role in why its coverage is not widespread in the country and this could be the case for 5G networks. In 2018, Ntel, a full 4G operator identified devices as the biggest problem to the adoption of the network. According to the operator, 4G is operated in over 4G sub-bands and there are fewer devices operating in the bands; and they are much more expensive.\n\nInstability in the FX market\n\nThe 5G operators in Nigeria would face a big cost hurdle while trying to navigate the foreign exchange market in Nigeria. The telecom industry in Nigeria depends heavily on foreign equipment manufacturers and imported technical expertise for the deployment and maintenance of networks.\n\nWhile the Nigerian government expects the 5G spectrum winners to deploy the technology within the first quarter of 2022, stakeholders in the industry say the major challenge is getting the offshore funding or accessing US dollar at a favourable exchange rate from Nigerian banks to import the needed equipment for 5G deployment.\n\nInadequate power supply\n\nThe electricity requirement for 5G technology is very high due to the need for more density coverage, more base stations, and additional equipment.

          "title": "Five policy steps to fast-track 5G roll-out in Nigeria",
          "text": "Towards the concluding week of January, the Nigerian government launched the National Policy on 5G, which signifies its willingness to make the technology a reality in the country.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in his statement extolled the benefits of 5G, particularly in tackling the insecurity situation in the country. He instructed the security agencies to leverage the technology to address the problem in the country.\n\nWhile the President\u2019s enthusiasm for 5G may be a welcome development for operators, the reality of the commercialisation of 5G technology in Nigeria depends more on the policies enabling its deployment. Mere rhetorical postulation will not be enough to convince investors to deploy at speed, or that the economies of scale make sense, according to people knowledgeable in the industry.\n\nWith less than 18 months left of its tenure, President Buhari administration can fast-track these five policy steps to enable investors deploy quickly:\n\nWorkforce training\n\nOne of the biggest CAPEX for 5G operators is the scarcity of talent for the technology.\n\nThe two operators MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications are going to need a lot of human resources to be able to deploy at scale and it may be too much on their CAPEX to directly be involved in the training of the workforce.\n\nBeing a relatively new industry, the Nigerian government can invest in the training of the workforce for 5G technology by enlisting the universities and other post-tertiary institutions across the country to achieve this. The government can also fund training and retraining for workers to prepare for and meet 5G-related workforce needs.\n\nThe Industrial Training International (ITI) in a report suggests that this training and retraining can be done in conjunction with industry to ensure that it meets the required skill set. Policymakers, therefore, should make available incentives to the industry to support training.\n\nAvailability of spectrum in a timely manner\n\nMaking additional spectrum available in a timely and affordable fashion is very important for accelerating advanced network deployment, says the GSMA in a report.\n\nThis is how South Korea and the US were able to deploy the technology at a quicker rate. Korea, the frontrunner in the global 5G race, made 280 MHz of the 3.5 GHz and 2400 MHz bands available in 2018. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) developed a \u201c5G FAST\u201d plan to make auctioning high-band spectrum a priority.\n\nAuctions have already been concluded for the 28GHz and 24GHz bands, with the 37GHz, 39GHz, and 47GHz being auctioned at the time of writing this report. In Singapore, the IMDA plans to release licences for both 3.5GHz and mmWave spectrum together.\n\nThe GSMA also notes that there should be a balance among competing objectives, such as maximising proceeds from spectrum auctions, fostering competition to keep consumer prices low, and enabling the build-out of new mobile broadband infrastructure.\n\nAccess to site locations\n\nAlthough the President claims his administration was able to implement in 2019 the N145 fee agreement for Right of Way for fibre optic cables reached in 2013, the reality on the ground is different for all operators. The charges remain exorbitant in about 29 states.\n\nBesides, local authorities deny carriers access to locations until they have made certain unspecified payments. The government can specify spaces for the deployment of fibre and 5G equipment. For example, in Japan, operators can install 5G base stations on 208,000 traffic lights across the country. The Japanese government also proposed that the costs of using the traffic lights for 5G deployments be shared between operators and local administrations. In the same vein, the UK\u2019s Electronic Communications Code facilitates operators\u2019 access to macro and small cell infrastructure on public and private land.\n\nFinancial support for deployment\n\nWhile the Nigerian government is fixated on generating revenue from the sale of 5G licence, it should also realise that it has a financial obligation towards the deployment of the technology, especially if it wants to ensure ubiquitous access to connectivity. There should be a subsidy from the government for 5G deployment.\n\nMany investors including MTN, which has the widest reach, would be hard-put to deploy its 5G network to rural areas where it has little chance of making returns on investment. This is partly why 4G deployment in the country is still at 37 percent because it is very expensive to provide full service to every corner of the country.\n\nRead also: Rich countries embrace network sharing arrangements for speedy 5G rollout\n\nDue to the high cost of 5G equipment, operators in the UK had to agree with the government to build a shared rural network with financial contributions from both industry and government. In Shenzhen, the city administration offered CNY10,000 for every standalone 5G base station constructed, up to 15,000 base stations or a total of CNY150 million. They also offered electricity cost subsidies of up to three years for 5G sites.\n\nEase of sharing network agreements\n\nDue to the enormous CAPEX and OPEX burden of network deployment on operators, network sharing has become a strategy aimed at reducing the cost weight. And this is not limited to just the 5G network as operators have used this method for previous generations.\n\nAccording to Mckinsey, operators have been able to reduce the total cost of ownership by up to 30 percent while improving network quality through sharing a variety of both active and passive equipment. 5G will be no exception, with operators eyeing new ways of accelerating the deployment of an otherwise daunting investment.\n\nA prominent example of a network sharing agreement is the one between Orange Belgium and Proximus in July 2019. The operators said the agreement will improve coverage of the 5G network in Belgium with the combined number of mobile sites rising by 20 percent higher than the existing separate radio access network. The agreement would never have been possible without the flexibility exhibited by the Belgium government.\n\nAlso in 2019, Orange and Vodafone Spain entered into an active sharing agreement for mobile infrastructure on 14,800 masts and back-haul components, including joint use of 5G sites. The deal with Orange was expected to deliver cumulative OPEX and CAPEX savings to Vodafone of $667 million over a period of ten years.\n\nNew operators like Mafab may need to tap into shared agreements to reduce the cost, it is therefore important the government demonstrate flexibility in such transactions.\n\n\u201cIt is vital for the wider success of 5G that such cooperative agreements do not run into regulatory roadblocks. A growing number of regulators are taking steps to permit, or even encourage, shared deployment, especially for small cells, recognising that network operators need the flexibility to share infrastructure assets,\u201d the GSMA noted in its policy report.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Owa Obokun Adimula of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran, has said the entire Ijesa people are resolute to return Governor Adegboyega Oyetola for second term in reciprocation of his modest achievements in the last three years.\n\nOba Aromolaran said this in his Palace when the train of strategic engagement tour of Governor Oyetola moved to Ijesa-South Federal Constituency.\n\nThe traditional ruler declared his unalloyed support on behalf of the traditional rulers, sons and daughters of Ijesaland for Governor, saying they are resolute to return him for second term.\n\nHe described Oyetola as a game changer whose tenure has brought drastic change to the art of governance in the state.\n\nThis is even as some members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Iperindo, Atakumosa East Local Government Area, defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOba Aromolaran commended the Governor for turning around the socio-economic fortune of the State despite the meagre resources at his disposal.\n\nThe reverred monarch specifically lauded the Governor for the sustenance of peace in the State, just as he assured him of his maximum support to move the State forward.\n\nAccording to him, the State has witnessed geometric progression under Oyetola\u2019s watch, hence, the need to give him a maximum support to succeed in the next governorship election.\n\n\u201cI profess to you that you are a new Governor. I know why I said it. I greet you warmly and welcome you into the palace of Owa Obokun Adimula of Ijesaland. Whoever I tell is a Governor will become Governor. This is a divine gift,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a place to talk long. Message has been passed already. We are going to pay you back. As far as Ijesaland is concerned, we don\u2019t have any other person to vote for except you. Thousands of aspirants may come out to contest, but you are our anointed candidate, and we are ready to vote massively for you.\n\n\u201cYour good work has spoken for you. I commend you for your modest achievements and I am confident that God will reward you. We have seen all you are doing to transform the State. You are doing excellently well.\n\n\u201cPlease continue to maintain peace. We don\u2019t want anything that would truncate the relative peace and the peaceful atmosphere in the State. We have warned our children and they are ready to continue to live in peace.\n\n\u201cI pledge on behalf of the Ijesa traditional rulers, sons and daughters that we are resolute to support you and continue to give your Adminstration topmost cooperation and vote for you massively in order to make sure that you are returned elected.\n\n\u201cYou will be returned. Whoever doesn\u2019t want can go and hit his head on the floor. We don\u2019t care. We believe strongly that you will win and across the State. I am in full control of Ijesaland and whatever I say is binding on every Ijesa son and daughter as the paramount ruler.\n\n\u201cPlease put your mind at rest. We are for you. I know you are for us too, you are our own and nothing can change it. We are very glad that you know our requests\u201d, he added.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Alamo of Ayegbaju-Ijesa in Atakumosa East Local Government Area, Oba Adeyemi Abideen, lauded Governor Oyetola for running a people-oriented government that has brought drastic change to all sectors.\n\nOba Abideen who is the Chairman, Council of Traditional Rulers in Atakumosa East Local Government Area, disclosed their readiness to work assiduously for the Governor\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cWe have held a meeting and we have resolved to vote for you. It is not about sentiment or because you are here today. It is about your personality and what you stand for. You have done well. Governor like you is rare. We are ever ready to support you and work for your return.\n\n\u201cYou have really tried. No one thought you could do as much as you have done. We thank God for your life. We thank God for giving you wisdom to do great things. We are happy for you. If we don\u2019t know many of your achievements, we are aware of the State of the economy before you came on board and we know what you have done to change the narrative.\n\n\u201cYou met huge debts with backlog of salary arrears among other challenges, but today, you have not only repaid appreciable percentage but invested hugely in the economy of the State.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t borrow but you are paying back loans taken by your predecessors. Over 70billion naira has been paid from the debts you met. Indeed, you have proved your adminstrative prowess and sagacity in the management of the scarce resources.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, we are behind you and your government. We are core progressives. This is the party we know. Many can come to us but inside of us, we know where we belong. We are aware of your tremendous achievements over the years. You have given us what we wanted, particularly in Ijesaland. What we want is continuity, not new Governor.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the defectors, Mr. Femi Adanlawo, lauded Governor Oyetola for being committed to the welfare of the people, saying his performance had motivated them to decamp from their former party.\n\nAdanlawo who described APC as the only party that cares for the welfare of the masses said their defection would contribute meaningful to the growth and development of the party as they were committed to adding values to the system.\n\nHe called on the co-defectors to see the party as theirs, noting that the rousing welcome given to them was a sign to the fact that the party meant well for all regardless of background or status.\n\nThe new members promised to work hand-in-hand with the leadership and members of the party to ensure victory for Governor Oyetola in the primary and governorship election.\n\nAddressing the mamonth crowd across the Local Governments of the Federal Constituency, Governor Oyetola urged the party loyalists to be wary of those that are buying membership slips.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the strengths of the party to elect him at the primary and ensure his emergence at the governorship election.\n\nGovernor Oyetola implored the party loyalists to keep their membership slips jealously and come out in large number to vote for him as the direct mode has been chosen by the National Secretariat of the party.",

Maude Aminun-Kano.\n\nWhile the agency fall short of naming the officer involved, investigations have linked the forfeiture to Mohammed, who was appointed was appointed ONSA director by the EFCC in 2017 under Ibrahim Magu to take charge of the finances of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), after N13 billion belonging to the spy agency was found in a Lagos apartment.\n\nThe commission had at that time taken charge of bank accounts operated by Nigeria\u2019s foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe recovered loot, made of $43.5 million, \u00a327,800 and N23.2 million, was found hidden inside Apartment 7B at Osborne Towers, Ikoyi by operatives of the EFCC on April 12.\n\nThen director general of the NIA, Ayodele Oke, had admitted that the money belonged to his agency and was later suspended from office.\n\nThe report noted that operatives of the commission, under Ibrahim Magu, compelled the director of Finance and Administration of the NIA to transfer the accounts to Mr Mohammed, an army official attached to the Office of the National Security Adviser.\n\nThe commission then appointed Mr Jafaru Mohammed to assume the position of the Director of Finance of the NIA and commence an audit of the agency\u2019s finances.\n\nThe report noted multiple attempts to impose Mr Mohammed on the NIA as its new Director of Finance, but officials of the agency blocked him from resuming each time.\n\nIn February 2021, Abdulrasheed Bawa was named as the new EFCC chairman to replace Mr Magu. In March, the anti-graft body obtained an interim forfeiture order from the Federal High Court in Abuja in respect of some properties allegedly belonging to National Security Adviser Mohammed Babagana Mungono but held in a proxy.\n\nJustice Folashade Ogunbanjo had in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/007/2021 ordered the interim forfeiture of eight properties linked to Mr Mohammed, as part of a wider probe into the finances of the Office of the NSA.\n\nThe assets listed included House on Plot 7, God\u2019s Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; plot at Kubwa Express, Directly opposite Abuja Model City Gate, Abuja; and a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.\n\nOthers are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; and No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.\n\nThe EFCC said it acted on intelligence that a serving top military officer was in the habit of acquiring high-profile properties and had floated companies that owned similar assets.\n\nThe commission also stated in the court document that Mr Mohammed had earned not more than N73.4 billion since his enlistment in the Nigerian Army in 1993, and could not have been able to legitimately acquire those properties.\n\nIn response, Mohammed had declared that his trial for alleged conspiracy, stealing and money laundering by the anti-graft agency was a personal vendetta.\n\nEFCC spokesperson Wilson Ujuwaren declined to comment on the agency\u2019s ties to Mr Mohammed, insisting that he would not disclose other information beyond what was contained in court documents.",

Is there any section of ASUU constitution which empowers it to override appointments made by universities? This is an affront. No more, no less.\n\n\u201cThe last time we checked, the power of appointment rests with A & P Committee of each university and pronouncement rests with the council.\n\n\u201cNo university worth its salt will consult ASUU over issue of promotion or appointment. Where did ASUU national get this absurd idea?\n\n\u201cWhen last did ASUU wade into procedures for promotion or appointment of any university? What we know of is that lecturers who feel wronged on promotion issues may report their university to the local ASUU.\n\n\u201cIs it a witch-hunt? Is ASUU dancing to the gallery by championing the hate campaign of a section of the country? But will ASUU be able to carry all its branches along?\n\n\u201cWill Northern universities see things the way ASUU national sees it? The leadership will divide the body again if it continues this way. Many other universities have formed other lecturers\u2019 associations because of bullying from the center.\n\n\u201cOne expects ASUU national to have learnt its lesson by now. There is a world of difference between fighting the collective cause of all members and fighting your own member or a particular branch.\n\n\u201cThis is a fight you cannot win. What came out of the conflict between ASUU national and its UNILORIN branch? Who blinked first? Ilorin dealt with ASUU national and got away with it.\n\n\u201cIt is quite amusing that ASUU national threatened to sanction those who participated in the FUTO appointment. It is an empty threat. Unions are not held together by the force of threats but good leadership.\n\n\u201cBesides, Professor Pantami\u2019s work at FUTO is a voluntary work that attracts no payment and this has a place in the rules of the civil service. Neither is the minister doing it without the knowledge and approval of Mr. President.\u201d\n\nMURIC insists that appointments conducted by the A & P committee of a university and ratified by the council cannot be illegal, advising ASUU leaders not to tear the body apart.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform have zoned the position of the national chairman of the party to the North-central.\n\nThe governor s, who met under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), took the decision ahead of the February 26 APC National Convention.\n\nAlthough divided, the governors also settled for South-south to produce the party\u2019s next national secretary, while agreeing that the deputy national chairman (South) be micro-zoned to South-east.\n\nThe governors reached this agreement Tuesday after a meeting of the forum which did not have some members in attendance.\n\nBlueprint gathered that some PGF members were against the decisions, especially those with presidential and vice presidential ambitions in the North-central region.\n\nAPC had slated February 26, 2022 for its national convention in Abuja, but the issue of zoning has remained a major challenge the needed to contend with to avoid self-implosion.\n\nIt was gathered that the APC governors\u2019 meeting also resolved to send a list of four national chairmanship aspirants from the North-central to President Muhammadu Buhari to show his preference for one of them even as they (governors) wait on the president to fine-tune their proposed zoning arrangement.\n\nA competent source told Blueprint correspondent that the president, currently in Brussels, Belgium, has scheduled a meeting with the governors Saturday (February 19) upon returning from the trip.\n\nThe aspirants\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants from the North-central include; Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa state, Malam Saliu Mustapha from Kwara state, Senator George Akume from Benue state as well as Senator Mohammed Sani Musa and Mohammed Etsu, both from Niger state.\n\nOthers are Senator Abdullahi Adamu from Nasarawa state and former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abu Bawa Bwari from Niger state.\n\nThe top party source confided in Blueprint that apart from the chairmanship position, secretary and that of the deputy national chairman, the governors decided to give Governor Mai Mala Buni Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and other critical stakeholders the leeway to decide on other positions among the remaining zones.\n\n\u201cThough the media was awash with the reports of the inability of the governors to meet with the president before he left for Brussels, in Belgium, the fact was that he (president) left instructions for the Caretaker Committee, the governors and some critical leaders of the party to fine-tune and come up with two names from the earlier list submitted to him.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the party leadership has made appreciable progress and nothing will stop the convention. The president gave specific instructions and the party leadership, in concert with the governors, are working round the clock to ensure a rancour-free convention.\n\n\u201cAnother important assignment given was to resolve the zoning of the National Secretary between South-south and South-east and present a position to him on Saturday when Mr President returns from the African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) Summit.\n\n\u201cAfter a heated discussion, the meeting resolved to zone the office of the National Secretary to South-south while the post of Deputy National Chairman (South) goes to South-east,\u201d the source said.\n\nAspirants write Buhari\n\nIn a related development, some aspirants have written to President Buhari, expressing confidence in the Buni-led CECPC.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of an open letter by the estranged Director General of the PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman to the president, Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter, the erstwhile PGF boss intimated Buhari of plans to sabotage the scheduled February 26 national convention of APC, referring to Buni\u2019s committee as an \u201cundertaker\u201d, which was not doing enough to show that it was ready to conduct a free, fair and credible exercise.\n\nBut in a swift response Wednesday through another open letter to President Buhari, the aspirants under the aegis of the Forum of APC Aspirants for 2022 National Convention, alleged that Lukman was engaging in some unholy activities, which also include, \u201cundermining the APC at the behest of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\u201d\n\nThe letter signed by a leading aspirant for the position of national youth leader, Barr. Maxwell Yakubu Gowon, on behalf of other aspirants; said the Buni-led convention committee had not done anything to warrant the aspirants losing confidence in the process.\n\n\u201cThe Forum of APC Aspirants for 2022 National Convention writes to intimate Your Excellency on the true state of affairs with the National Convention of our great party, the All Progressive Congress (APC). We had initially decided against burdening Mr. President with the humdrum of the party\u2019s working in the belief that the APC has enough statements in its fold to resolve ongoing issues while allowing Your Excellency on piloting the affairs of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, the revisionist open letter authored by the immediate past Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, who identified as a \u201cFreelance APC Campaigner.\u201d Without trivializing the present battle for the soul of the APC, it is pertinent to clarify from the onset that Lukman is yet to recover from the disgraceful circumstances of his exit as Director General of PGF and the only straw he can hold on to is to vilify the person and office of the Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), His Excellency Mai Mala Buni and other members of the Committee.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, Lukman is neither an aspirant nor a candidate of our party for the Convention and for any election in the future. In fact, the shady details about his forced exit from his most recent position were about how he was undermining the APC at the behest of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cWe are perplexed that Lukman is today pontificating and creating the impression that he means well for the party. If he truly means well, even as a lowly administrator of PGF, he would have leveraged that position to appeal to his former employers, the APC state governors, to respect party democracy and allow the will of most party members to prevail at the state chapters of the party. Whatever crises the party faces nationally today were birthed at the state levels owing to the overbearing disposition of some state governors. It is therefore perplexing that Lukman who timidly watched the state governors damage the party is now crying murder and attempting to re-write history as we know it and exonerate the state governors.\n\n\u201cWe find it ridiculous that the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), which under the leadership of His Excellency Buni worked tirelessly to resolve some of the crisis in the party, was criminally maligned by Lukman. He accused the Committee of being highhanded and yet expects the same Committee to disregard the views strongly expressed by the party\u2019s stakeholders pertaining to conditions that must be met to have a successful convention.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that the clamour from stakeholders have been majorly about redressing the damages done by the governors at the state chapters, which would make mockery of democracy and our great party if the mistake is made of progressing with the convention without first addressing them. The CECPC refusal to plunge the party further into crisis by succumbing to the whims of the governors, for whom Lukman speaks, is the reason that the Committee and its leadership came under the kind of scathing attack contained in the open letter.\n\n\u201cContrary to the lies that the likes of Lukman have promoted about the current leadership of the party, Forum of APC Aspirants for 2022 National Convention is pleased to assert that H.E. Buni\u2019s CEPCP is a major reason we still have confidence that the party can still be healed and repositioned in time for it to excel in the 2023 elections. The CEPCP Chairman performed creditably in the way he has handled preparations for the convention by consulting with aspirants before key decisions are taken.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we would have urged Your Excellency, in your capacity as the leader of our great party, to order an investigation of the disgraced former Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman to find out the extent to which he is complicit of the allegation that he is being funded by the opposition PDP to undermine the APC.\n\n\u201cWe came to the realisation that this would be playing into the plot to distract the APC at the highest level, which is not needed at this point. The designation of \u201cFreelance APC Campaigner\u201d he assigned to himself is enough proof that he has already expelled from the party since the concept of freelance campaigner is alien to the party.\n\n\u201cOur prayer, however, is that Mr. President should pass a vote of confidence in His Excellency Mai Mala Buni-CEPCP\u2019s ability to organize the National Convention that will usher in a new dawn for the APC. This expression of confidence in the Committee will re-assure us that we are in a party of rule of law and internal democracy,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) says the recent importation of toxic Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, into the country was not deliberate.\n\nIt added that there was no way the importers would have known that the petrol contained methanol, as checking for the substance was not a primary requirement for the relevant bodies.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director (GMD), Mele Kyari, stated this on Wednesday during an interaction with the House of Representatives ad-hoc committee investigating the circumstances surrounding the importation of the adulterated fuel into the country.\n\n\u201cNo one out there will bring this product into this country deliberately,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we would have seen this methanol except your supplier decides to disclose to you because it is not part of their requirements to look for this.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: DSS Explains Why Nnamdi Kanu Is Not Allowed To Change His Clothes\n\nKyari stressed that the company was not aware of the presence of methanol in the imported fuel and has taken measures to manage the situation.\n\nHe explained that the loading terminal from where the toxic petrol was brought into the country has been supplying gasoline for a very long time, as it was a major terminal supplying fuel not only to West Africa but many countries in Europe.\n\nThe NNPC chief assured Nigerians that about 2.1 billion litres of the product would have been injected into the system before the end of the month.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that we have taken every necessary step to make sure that we maintain supply sufficiency, and as I have just reiterated for the benefit of Nigerians that we have a robust supply plan.\n\n\u201cBy the end of this month, we will have up to 2.1 billion litres of PMS in this country (that will not contain methanol). Let us put it on record that what we always call panic-buying is nothing \u2026 I can assure you that we will contain this situation,\u201d he added.\n\nKyari appeared before the lawmakers amid growing concerns over fuel scarcity which has worsened in Abuja, Lagos, and some parts of the country where hundreds of motorists were left stranded on long queues at filling stations in various parts of the country.\n\nAs part of measures to address the situation, the company directed all its depots and outlets to begin 24 hours operations across the country.\n\nNNPC Group Executive Director (Downstream), Mr Adetunji Adeyemi, who briefed reporters on Tuesday in Abuja, stated that the company was already accelerating petrol distribution.\n\nStressing that several million litres of petrol were in stock, he revealed that the NNPC was expecting about 2.3 billion litres of petrol in the country by the end of the month.\n\nAdeyemi said the company has constituted a monitoring team with the support of the authority and other security agencies to ensure the smooth distribution of petrol nationwide.",

          "text": "The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, on Wednesday said he is willing to reach an agreement with the striking university lecturers under the aegis of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nHe, however, said he was surprised that the lecturers could decide to embark on industrial action when the Federal Government was addressing the issues they have raised.\n\n\u201cASUU, unfortunately, they have gone on strike and I am looking for them because all the issues are being addressed,\u201d the minister stated while briefing reporters at the end of the Federal Executive Council meeting held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe last thing that happened was that our committee looked at their demands, but there are renegotiations going on. The Federal Government is ready to meet them on all issues they have raised and if there are so many meetings and the gap is not closing, then I think it\u2019s not the fault of the government.\n\nREAD ALSO: ASUU Declares One-Month Warning Strike\n\nASUU President, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, had on Monday declared a one-month warning strike, saying that the union tried to avoid the industrial action but the Federal Government was unresponsive to its demands.\n\nThe lecturers also blamed their decision on the government\u2019s inability to implement the Memorandum of Action it signed with them in December 2020.\n\nPeaceful Resolution\n\nWhile maintaining his resolve to reach an agreement with the union, Adamu believes there is always a solution to every problem.\n\n\u201cThere is a solution to this; the negotiations are the solution and that is why I have said that I am surprised that ASUU has gone on strike,\u201d he said. \u201cThey submitted a draft agreement which the ministry is looking at.\n\n\u201cA committee is looking at it. Immediately it finishes, the government is meant to announce what it has accepted. Then suddenly, I heard them going on strike. We want a peaceful resolution.\u201d\n\nThe minister also reacted to several accusations by ASUU, including claims that he has consistently shunned the negotiation meetings but sends representatives.\n\nHe added that the allegation that government does not want a peaceful resolution to the crisis was not true.\n\nRather, Adamu said he has been the one summoning every meeting held and has equally been in attendance, except within the period he was away for medical treatment in Germany.\n\nWhen asked if the government would reach an agreement with ASUU before the end of the 30-day strike, the minister said he doesn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you time,\u201d the minister said. \u201cI am ready to reach an agreement with ASUU now, but since I\u2019m not the only one, I can\u2019t give you time. But certainly, we are going to reach an agreement very soon.\u201d",

He added that, thrice, Kanu\u2019s younger brother has been refused access to DSS facility where Kanu was detained.\n\nThe lead counsel also lamented that since Kanu was arrested and detained, his eye glass was seized by the DSS and has not been returned to him. He asks that his Glasses, be returned to him so he doesn\u2019t go blind.\n\nJustice Nyako said the complaint has been noted and directed Ozekhome to proceed with the business of the day.\n\nAt this juncture, Ozekhome said he has an application that basically seeks the quashing, striking out, and dismissing of the 15-count amended charge against Kanu for being incompetent and denying the court of jurisdiction to entertain the 15-count amended charge.\n\nThe application, with 34 grounds, and supported by 36-paragraph affidavit, Ozekhome said, also seeks for an order acquitting and discharging Kanu for want of jurisdiction and defective, baseless and incompetent charges.\n\nThe matter was then adjourned to April 8 to rule on Kanu\u2019s applications to quash the charge.\n\nMr Kanu is accused of various offences, including treasonable felony and terrorism, offences he allegedly committed in the course of his separatist campaigns.",

          "text": "Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, who has been at the center of a doping scandal throughout the Beijing Olympics, had three substances used to treat heart conditions in her sample, according to a document that was filed in her arbitration hearing.\n\nThe document, which was released by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and viewed by The New York Times and CNN, said that Valieva tested positive not only for the banned drug trimetazidine but also for Hypoxen and L-carnitine, which are not blacklisted.\n\nValieva\u2019s defense team claimed that the teen skating star may have accidentally ingested traces of trimetazidine by sharing a drinking glass with her grandfather, who takes the heart medication. The drug, commonly used to treat angina, has been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since 2014 for its potential to enhance blood flow and aid endurance.\n\nThe Russian manufacturer of Hypoxen says the product increases endurance and reduces fatigue during physical activity by promoting more efficient oxygen use.\n\nL-carnitine is an amino acid taken as a dietary supplement that may also increase blood flow and oxygen supply to muscles. It is not prohibited on its own, but infusions of high doses are not allowed. In 2019, the US Anti-Doping Agency suspended track coach Alberto Salazar for four years \u2014 later extended to a lifetime ban \u2014 for improperly using substances including L-carnitine.\n\nThe head of the USADA, Travis Tygart, told CNN that the presence of the three drugs in Valieva\u2019s system \u201cappears to be the case of a pretty deliberate attempt to use substances in order to enhance performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s using the three that showed the intent of trying three different routes that ultimately give the same impact on performance: increased endurance, reduced shortness of breath, tiredness,\u201d Tygart said.\n\nHowever, he added that he didn\u2019t believe the 15-year-old athlete would have had the knowledge or resources to coordinate such a scheme on her own.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency has announced that it is investigating the entourage surrounding Valieva. The agency\u2019s chief, Witold Banka, tweeted Tuesday that the doping of minors is \u201cevil and unforgivable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors, coaches and support personnel who are found to have provided performance-enhancing drugs to minors should be banned for life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also think that they should be in prison.\u201d\n\nThe Russian star was cleared by arbitrators on Monday to compete in the Olympics despite the positive test, which was returned last week from a sample taken in December.\n\nThe panel rejected appeals by WADA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Skating Union to reinstate a suspension that was originally levied but then removed by Russian anti-doping authorities.\n\nValieva finished as the top qualifier in the women\u2019s singles short program on Tuesday, and remains the overwhelming favorite to win the event after the free skate on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the IOC has announced that no medals will be distributed to any athletes if Valieva reaches the podium. The medal ceremony from last week\u2019s team figure skating competition, which the Russian squad won behind the teen phenom\u2019s dominant performances, are also on hold until the full anti-doping investigation is completed.",
