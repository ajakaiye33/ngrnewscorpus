What is more dangerous is the fact that since they operate in mufti, it is difficult to separate their activities from that of unknown gunmen and other criminals,\u201d it said.\n\nThe party called on security agents in the State to investigate all the crimes against the outfit.\n\nBut Caretaker Committee chairman of the party and Commissioner for Internal Security, Chief Stanley Okoro Emegha described the allegations as the handiwork of jobless persons.\n\n\u201cThese people are just looking for attention.

It is simple; the possibility that Ebubeagu has succeeded in emasculating the evil plans of these PDP Stakeholders hence their incessant complaints about the outfit, cannot be ruled out\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe truth is that these PDP Stakeholders had wished that the entire Ebonyi State went up in uncontrollable conflagration in line with their threats to deal with and make the Governor regret his action of defecting to the APC.\n\n\u201cBut they are frustrated by their failures to achieve this evil agenda, hence their vicious propaganda against Ebubeagu for checkmating them by complimenting the efforts of other security agencies in returning peace to Ebonyi State,\u201d Simbad said.",

Daily Sun learnt that some patients on admission in public hospitals yesterday moved out to private hospitals to continue treatment, a decision that comes with higher bills. Like in previous strikes by doctors in public service, private health clinics are expected to record bumper harvest from this month\u2019s industrial disharmony in the public health care system. But there is anxiety of more avoidable deaths, especially in emergency situations, given the fewer number of private healthcare facilities and the capacity of personnel to absorb thousands of patients in need of treatment across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Medical and Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal (MDPDT), yesterday, said no fewer than 31 health professionals comprising medical doctors and dentists are to appear before it for alleged professional misconduct.\n\nTheir trial is sequel to complaints by unsatisfied patients who felt the health professionals had violated their professional ethics or code in treating them.\n\nThe MDPDT said the trial which starts today would run till Thursday and would provide opportunities for the accused doctors to defend themselves either in person or alongside their legal counsels.\n\nA senior staff of MDCN who pleaded anonymity said of the 31 medical professionals summoned to appear before the Prof. Abba Waziri led disciplinary tribunal, 25 doctors would be appearing before the tribunal for first time while two doctors are expected to submit their written addresses for possible adoption. Four doctors are expecting final judgements from previous cases following the successful completion of their trials by the tribunal, the source said.\n\n\u201cSome of the doctors may be convicted because of indisputable facts about their cases, and they risk the withdrawal of their practicing licences,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said MDCN disciplinary book recommended several punishment for erring doctors including outright withdrawal of practicing licence of any doctor convicted of gross negligence or other forms of professional misconduct.\n\nIn September 2019, the disciplinary committee ordered immediate withdrawal of the practicing licence of Adamawa-based doctor, Yakubu Hassan Koji, after he was convicted of gross professional misconduct by the tribunal.\n\nDr. Koji was found to have ignored some professional rules when he engaged in a surgery that led to the damage of a kidney of Isa Hamma, now deceased.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Obinna Uzo, and Mokwugwo Solomon, Nnewi\n\nChairman of the United Nigeria Airlines, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, has rejoined the Anambra State governorship race, with Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) substituting its candidate with his name.\n\nThe substitution of candidate was completed on Friday, July 30, 2021 at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe submission of Okonkwo\u2019s name followed his earlier resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in protest over the outcome of an illegitimate primary election where the party abandoned its constitution and used an illegal process to pick its governorship candidate. Already the PDP is contending with an avalanche of court cases ahead November 6 election.\n\nAlso submitted to INEC was the name of Dame (Barr.) Jessie Balonwu, a former member of the House of Representatives and also a former State Women Leader of the PDP, as running-mate to Dr. Okonkwo.\n\nDame Balonwu, who is from Onitsha North and South Federal Constituency of Anambra North Senatorial District, was also the first Igbo female senator-elect and Commissioner for education in Anambra state. She also served the state meritoriously as Chairman, Anambra State Universal Basic Education Board (ASUBEB between 2005 and 2007.\n\nDr. Okonkwo\u2019s movement to ZLP followed a groundswell of pressure from political and community leaders, opinion moulders, stakeholders, support groups and institutional advocates for the good governance of Anambra State.\n\nThe pressure had led to the formation of the Save Anambra Coalition which is an amalgam of advocates of good governance from all the senatorial zones of the state and cut across all political parties and established institutions and faith-based organizations in the state.\n\nThe Save Anambra Coalition also consists of former aspirants to the governorship of the state from the different political parties who are not satisfied with the lack of internal democracy and direction of the parties and are also disturbed by the absence of purposeful leadership of the state by the ruling party.\n\nThese political leaders are unhappy with the direction Anambra\u2019s development had taken in the past years under the supervision of Mr. Willie Obiano and feel that he must not be rewarded with the luxury of picking a successor for the state. These political leaders and influencers are therefore united in their decision to support Dr. Okonkwo as a consensus candidate because of his level of integrity, focus, drive and blueprint for the good governance and development of Anambra State.\n\nFurther pressure on Dr. Okonkwo to re-enter the governorship race came from the Rescue Anambra Coalition, which is a coalition of market groups, trade unions, professional organizations, transport organizations and grassroots mobilization groups across the state, which had at a recent press conference in Onitsha, urged Dr. Okonkwo to make the move.\n\nAlso, statutory delegates of the PDP, including all elected members of the executive in the 21 local government areas and 326 wards of the state, had called on Dr. Okonkwo to re-enter the guber race vowing to go with him wherever he goes.\n\nLeadership of ZLP will formally unveil Dr. Okonkwo and Dame Balonwu to the good people of Anambra in the next few days.\n\nDr. Obiora Okonkwo holds a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Political Science (with distinction), from the Russian Academy of Science, Institute of World Economy and International Relations, Moscow; a Professional Fellowship Doctorate, from the Institute of Chartered Economists of Nigeria; and Fellowship of the Institute of Chartered Arbitrators and Mediators of Nigeria. He earned a Master of Science Degree in Economics, also, with distinction, from the Russian Peoples Friendship University, Moscow, and a First Class in Economics from the Russian Peoples Friendship University, also, in Moscow.\n\nHe had his early education in Onitsha, Anambra State, where he combined trading at the Main Market and managing a horde of apprentices, with schooling.\n\nHigh Chief Okonkwo, who is married with children, is a bridge-builder across all zones and of Anambra State and Nigeria.\n\nDame (Barrister) Jessie Uka Balonwu holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Law from University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria (1982-1986), and having attended Lagos Law School (1986-1987), she was called to the Bar in 1987. Dame Balonwu attended Anglican Girls Secondary School Oba where she obtained West African School Certificate in 1971.

          "text": "\u2022Stakeholders canvass reinstatement of dissolved NWC without Oshiomhole\n\n\u2022Your ward congresses are a nullity, says PDP\n\n\u2022APC: Opposition party not an interpreter of law\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nWorried by the narrow escape of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in retaining Ondo State and the broader implications of the pronouncement by the Supreme Court, particularly, as it relates to the position of the National Chairman of APC, Mai Mala Buni, President Muhammadu Buhari, from faraway London, had directed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to take charge of the legal concerns and come up with a decision in the overall interest of the party.\n\nOsinbajo, too, wasted no time in summoning a meeting of all the lawyers in the cabinet to deliberate on what to do as the congresses were just a day away, Saturday to be precise.\n\nAt the meeting, competent sources said, the consensus of opinions was that the party should pause the congresses slated for last Saturday before weighing other options. But only Malami objected, arguing that the exercise could go ahead, regardless.\n\nThose in attendance at the meeting which held at the vice president\u2019s office were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola; Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Minister of State for Labour, Mr. Festus Keyamo; and Professor Tahir Mamman, a former Director General of the Nigeria Law School and legal adviser/member of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC.\n\nAfter what allegedly turned out a heated debate, everyone at the meeting, THISDAY gathered, agreed that the first step to addressing the \u201celephant in the room\u201d was to suspend the congresses, which unfortunately, held last weekend.\n\nA majority of those in attendance, THISDAY was told, shared some of the argument that followed the Supreme Court judgment on Ondo and had contended that it was only logical to minimize the damage the APC might suffer in the final analysis, by first suspending the congresses and then, fashion out other possible options.\n\nBut Malami would have none of it. \u201cHe disagreed with the submissions of others and insisted that the congresses could go ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution reached was to suspend the congresses,\u201d a source privy to the meeting stated.\n\nWhile debate was still on, Osinbajo was said to have made effort to reach the President by phone to intimate him of developments but failed.\n\nHaving reached the decision to pause the congress, Osinbajo decided to call Governor Buni on the resolution to suspend to congresses scheduled for Saturday.\n\nBut to his shock, Buni flatly rejected his directive, insisting like Malami that the congresses would go ahead as planned. Malami and Buni belong to the CPC tendency of the APC.\n\nIt was a bemused Osinbajo, who watched helplessly as Buni refused to obey his directive to suspend the congresses.\n\nAccording to sources, Malami and Buni\u2019s hesitance to discard experts\u2019 opinions despite glaring danger might have been because some people identified as cabal in the presidency did not want to lose their current hold on the party especially, that they were believed to have had a choice presidential candidate in mind, of which a change in the course of the party could undo.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the APC is currently facing an existential threat as two major tendencies wrestle for control of the party. These tendencies as represented by the legacy parties that merged to form the ruling party \u2013 the Congress for Progressive Change and the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nIndeed, there was said to be an understanding at inception that while the CPC, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, would control the government, how the party is run would be the prerogative of the ACN, a party led by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nUnfortunately, the fear of what might likely be in 2023 has begun dawn on and force the CPC tendency to not only renege on this understanding, but also doing all within its reach to completely take over the party and dominate the other tendencies especially, the ACN.\n\nTherefore, while the PDP wing of the merger, led by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has since been relegated from exerting any form of control or accorded any sense of belonging especially, that his other allies had since returned to their former party, the PDP; the CPC tendency has literally taken over the party now and is desperately working to consolidate its hold ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThus, by going ahead with the congresses last weekend, despite concerns about the legal implications that option portended for the party, it demonstrates once again that it is willing to risk the existence of the party in pursuit of its narrow objective. The CPC tendency clearly seeks to plant his loyalists across the board and finally cut other tendencies to size even when its equity to the merger (states controlled pre-2015 polls) was the least, when compared to other legacy parties.\n\nHowever, shedding more light on the Supreme Court judgment in a position paper, which appears in sync with Festus Keyamo\u2019s position on the raging crisis, a former National Legal Adviser of the APC, Babatunde Ogala stated, \u201cI have read suggestions by my brother silk, Festus Keyamo, SAN to the effect that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Party as well as its Board of Trustees (BOT) should take charge of the affairs of the Party through a committee set up by either organ.\n\n\u201cThis is a very wise proposition except that NEC alongside all other organs of the Party were purportedly dissolved at a meeting convened and presided over by Governor Mai Mala Buni. Sadly, the Notice for the NEC meeting was issued by the same tainted leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is my view that the meeting may not have been properly convened in the eyes of the law and its resolution(s) may have been void ab initio. This gives a leeway for the NEC to resume its duties and convene meetings immediately where it will decide the future of the party.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Trustees of the Party was never and has still not been constituted till date. So, in effect, the Party does not have a BOT that could convene even a meeting of the BOT, talk more of convening a National Convention or indeed any statutory meeting of the Party.\n\n\u201cThe reinstatement of the dissolved National Working Committee (NWC) without the erstwhile Chairman, who was suspended from office by Order of a court of competent jurisdiction should be seriously considered in other to cloak the impending Ward, Local Government Area and State Congresses as well as National Convention with the imprint of legality.\n\n\u201cMany of the NWC members have since moved on to better things and would be reluctant to return to their positions but this is the hard decision we must all take for the sake of saving our dear party,\u201d Ogala maintained.\n\nOgala, who was not physically present at the meeting, continued: \u201cIt is my opinion, that in this moment, there is no place for parochial grandstanding. Just as the former NWC accepted their dissolution without much hassle, it is time for the current Caretaker Committee to sacrifice for the posterity of APC.\n\n\u201cThe fate of APC is at stake in that all successes, victories and triumphs gained by the party will continue to hang on a very thin thread in the face of the progressive attitude of our courts on election and political matters.\u201d\n\nHe contended that the decision of the Supreme Court had opened the flood gates for endless litigation challenging every action and decision of the APC leadership as presently constituted.\n\n\u201cIn closing,\u201d Ogala said, \u201cI acknowledge the Supreme Court for its decision and specifically note the hint the Court gave to us to clean our acts and come into the bounds of legality before the worse happens at the forthcoming general election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), last night, said the ward congress conducted by the APC amounted to a nullity, given the pronouncement of the Supreme Court, which invalidated the Buni-led national executive.\n\nThe PDP, therefore, vilified Buni and other APC leaders for deceiving innocent Nigerians and cajoling them to participate in the needless exercise, which ended in violent crisis and avoidable deaths, when they knew it was all in futility.\n\nBut the leadership of the APC , while dismissing the PDP as no interpreter of the law, has asked it to keep its \u201cbaseless comments\u201d on APC leadership to itself, saying it was aimed at distracting attention from its depleting fortunes and rudderless leadership, which has led its members and leaders abandoning the party.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the opposition party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan said, it was indeed callous that the leaders of the APC, despite knowing that any process conducted by the Buni-led national executive, whose legal status, in the face of section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC constitution, has been queried by the Supreme Court, could extort from their innocent followers and subject them to a fraudulent exercise that is a nullity.\n\n\u201cWhile Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) bars a sitting governor from holding any other office while serving as state governor, Article 17(4) of the APC constitution clearly states that \u2018no officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PDP explained that the implication was that with Buni as chairman, the APC has no valid national executive and as such any congress or any other statutory process conducted by the APC under this circumstance remained a nullity.\n\n\u201cOur party, therefore, counsels those who participated in the ridiculous drama called APC ward congress to know that they have been viciously scammed. They should not worsen their situation by allowing the deceptive APC leaders to further set them against one another in bloody clashes for a party that has technically gone defunct,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nBut the National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement issued yesterday said, instead of being humbled by the defeat of the recent Supreme Court judgement on the Ondo Governorship election, the PDP has turned itself to an interpreter of law.\n\n\u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is an old, lonely, toothless and hungry Hyena wandering aimlessly in the jungle of political wilderness. Nigerians are fully aware of its antecedents and will never take it seriously no matter how much empty noise it makes.\n\n\u201cWe note how arrogantly the PDP has become an interpreter of the laws of the nation by ignorant comments on the recent Supreme Court judgement, which affirmed the election victory of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, and dismissed the PDP\u2019s case on the grounds that it was incompetent,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe noted that the PDP had reached the end of its political road and Nigerians would never trust it again with the governance of this country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Justice Clara Bata Ogunbiyi, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court and Honourable Commissioner 1 in the Commission for the Commission\u2019s Chairman, Alhaji Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector General of Police, who is currently on leave.\u201d\n\nOtis Wright of the United States District Court for the Central District of California had ordered the FBI to arrest Kyari and produce him in the United States for his role in a $1.1million fraud, perpetrated by Abbas Ramon otherwise called Hushpuppi.\n\nThe US court documents showed that the American prosecutors had first sought a court warrant to arrest Kyari on February 12, 2021, while another warrant was requested on April 29, 2021.\n\nBut Wright\u2019s permission for the FBI to arrest Kyari and hold him in a US custody was unsealed on July 26, 2021.\n\nHushpuppi had narrated to the US court how he allegedly bribed Kyari to arrest and jail one of his rivals in Nigeria over the disputed sharing formula of $1.1million scam of a Qatari businessman.\n\nFollowing this development, youths in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who have warned the EFCC to stay away from using Saraki\u2019s case to cover up Kyari\u2019s allegation said the anti-graft agency must stay away from chasing shadows.\n\nEFCC, at the weekend, had invited Saraki for questioning on Saturday, raising widespread reports about alleged arrest, with many accusing the anti-graft agency of attempting to use his case to mask the gravity of Kyari\u2019s indictment and make it seem like the government was fighting corruption.\n\nThe PDP youth, under the aegis of South-south Youth Vanguard, cautioned EFCC against chasing shadows.\n\nIn a statement by its National Chairman, James Akpofure, the group advised the anti-graft agency to go after those reaping and looting the country and stop acting like an attack dog for the All Progressives Congress (APC) federal government.\n\n\u201cThe earlier the EFCC knows that it was established to fight corruption in the interest of the public the better. It should stop doing the bidding of the government in power. By working for the interest of the people, the comity of nations will see us as toeing the right path to meet international best practices.\u201d\n\nAnother group, Northern Youths Transparency Vanguard, also criticised the invitation and alleged arrest of Saraki as an attempt to divert attention from the grave corruption charges against Kyari, who is wanted in the US on charges related to wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nPresident, Northern Youths Transparency Vanguard, Mallam Inuwa Sabo, in a statement, accused EFCC of trying to distract public attention from the serious implications of a decorated policeman fraternizing with a known fraudster.\n\nSabo alleged that EFCC helped to circulate a story that the former senate president had been arrested over renewed corruption allegations, when a topical and humongous case of corruption of international magnitude was hanging over the head of Kyari.\n\n\u201cIt is no news to Nigerians that the EFCC has continuously investigated allegations of corruption and raised trumped up charges against the former senate president, which when tested in the courts, have always fallen flat. Still, the EFCC and their paymasters and cyber peddlers keep fanning the flames of hyperbole and ingenious propaganda with Saraki\u2019s name under renewed allegations of corruption.\n\n\u201cIf fighting corruption means much to the EFCC, they should address the concerns of Nigerians about the red-hot Abba Kyari relationship with the convicted scammer,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022OPS calls for unified exchange rate\n\n\u2022Emefiele: Political leaders support our action on currency dealers\n\n\u2022Naira sustains gains on parallel market\n\nDike Onwuamaeze\n\nMembers of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) have strongly supported last week\u2019s decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to discontinue with the weekly sale of the United States dollars to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators.\n\nThis is just as members of the Organised Private Sector (OPS) have advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to go beyond its action on the currency dealers and work towards unifying the foreign exchange (FX) windows in the country in order to checkmate round-tripping and other malpractices.\n\nAlso, the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele has explained that it was not only the apex bank that was disturbed by the infractions being perpetrated by the BDCs prior to the apex bank\u2019s hammer, saying the political leadership in the country had also expressed concern about the activities of the currency dealers.\n\nHowever, despite concerns that the naira may depreciate heavily against the dollar on the parallel market after the central bank\u2019s action, the nation\u2019s currency maintained its rally on Friday as it closed at N515 to a dollar, stronger than the N520 to a dollar it was the previous day.\n\nMAN in a statement titled: \u201cMAN\u2019s Perspective on the CBN New Policy on Forex Allocation to BDCs,\u201d signed by its Director General, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, stated that the directive of the CBN on the BDCs corroborated with its view and may help address the maladroit (sic) activities of operators in the BDC market.\n\n\u201cHowever, much of the efficiency and effectiveness of the new guidelines will be determined by how determined the CBN and commercial banks will be to ensure that FX gets to genuine users.\n\n\u201cFor instance, with the new policy, manufacturers will depend solely on the interbank market for their FX needs. We hope the banks will provide a seamless process and timely execution of foreign exchange applications by manufacturers,\u201d the association added.\n\nAjayi-Kadir also noted that MAN had made various submissions on the need for the CBN to collapse various FX windows into a single official foreign window.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a single FX window will eliminate the excesses of middlemen, save the value of the naira and allow for available FX to be allocated productively using the official banking protocols,\u201d he added.\n\nMAN further argued that a major challenge with FX allocation to the BDC segment, \u201cis that the operators always lacked the ability and the will to continuously adhere to set guidelines. Most times their operations drift into round tripping and other financial incongruities that negate the overall objective of creating the BDC foreign exchange market.\n\n\u201cThe end result was always the escalation of the premium of foreign exchange in BDC compared to the official window and further depreciation of the naira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele: Political leaders support our action on currency dealers\n\nEmefiele, in responding to a question on the matter said the political authorities had engaged the central bank on the infractions going on in that segment of the market in the past.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue even the political authorities had engaged the central bank on and we tried our best to defend the BDCs. Put bluntly, even our leaders who constitute the political authorities have raised concerns about the modus operandi of BDCs in Nigeria. We did our best to defend them, but at this stage, we cannot continue.\n\n\u201cSo, if you ask me if we carried the political authorities along, I would say the political authorities themselves had long though that this should stop,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, apart from monetary and price stability, the central bank also has a responsibility to maintain the reserves and exchange rate of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, it is our primary role ascribed to us by law that we should do what we need to do. They were countries whose central bank was selling forex to BDCs in the past and at some point they dropped the idea.\n\n\u201cBut we have as a result of request and pressure continued to do this and we have done this to see that we create business for those who operate in this market. And we believed that as long as they continue to do this, not only for their benefit, but for the benefit of the economy,\u201d he added.\n\nOPS Calls for Unified Exchange Rate\n\nAlso, the OPS were optimistic that the new policy direction by the CBN might be beneficiary to the economy in the long run, saying no central bank in the world sells FX directly to the BDC except in Nigeria.\n\nThey, however, observed that channeling the supply of foreign exchange through the commercial banks without addressing its supply side might unintentionally trigger a boom in the black market for foreign exchange.\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association ((NECA) told THISDAY that banning FX allocation directly to the BDCs and channeling same to the commercial banks without addressing the supply side of the market would not be enough.\n\nThe Director General of the NECA, Mr. Timothy Olawale, enjoined the CBN to, \u201cdevelop strategies in addressing the exchange market by reviewing the fixed market regime and allow the market to find its balance, as fixed market regime is disincentive to inflow of foreign exchange and diaspora remittances.\n\n\u201cAn exchange management posture that features multiple official rates, distorts the market, denies foreign exchange to critical productive sectors and facilitates illegal arbitrage.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, the Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Mr. Ayo Olukanni, told THISDAY that the association understood the need for the CBN to take urgent measures to ensure the legitimate use of FX and prevent wholesale and illegal use, but, however, \u201csees this directive as a latest in the long list of actions by the CBN to ensure absolute control of the Nigerian foreign exchange market, in terms of who buys, who sells and for what purpose.\n\n\u201cBut, given the bureaucratic nature of the process of obtaining \u2018legitimate\u2019 foreign exchange, the implication of this directive is likely to be a blossoming black market for foreign exchange with serious implications on businesses with time-sensitive needs for foreign exchange in terms of import of raw materials.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Corporation posts sale of N234.63bn fuel in March\n\n\u2022FG appeals $1.3bn Eni, Shell corruption case in Italian court\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has continued to narrow its total basket of importation of refined petroleum products to just premium motor spirit (petrol), with the importation of kerosene now fully stopped.\n\nAlso, the quantity of petrol brought into country by the corporation climbed to 99.24 per cent in March this year.\n\nThe data contained in the just-released March 2021 edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), indicated that a paltry 450,000 litres of diesel was brought into the country during the month, constituting less than 0.76 per cent of total imports.\n\nThe NNPC stated that its downstream subsidiary, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), recorded N234.63 billion revenue from the sale of white products in the month of March 2021, representing a 24.7 per cent increase compared with the N188.15billion sales recorded in the previous month of February 2021.\n\nThe report indicated that total revenue generated from the sales of white products for the period of March 2020, to March 2021, stood at N2.129 trillion, whereby petrol contributed about 99.24 per cent of the total sales with a value of N2.113 trillion.\n\nIn terms of volume, it noted that the above value translated to 1.75 billion litres of white products sold and distributed by PPMC in the month of March 2021 compared to 1.4billion litres in the month of February 2021.\n\n\u201cThis volume is made up of 1.782 billion litres of petrol and 0.45 million litres of diesel.\n\nTotal sale of white products for the period of March 2020 to March 2021 stood at 17.374 billion litres and petrol accounted for 17.265 billion litres or 99.37 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC continues to diligently monitor the daily stock of petrol to achieve uninterrupted supply, effective distribution and zero fuel queues across Nigeria,\u201d it stated.\n\nIn the gas sector, the corporation stated that a total of 222.74 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas was produced in the month of March 2021, translating to an average daily production of 7,183.33 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd).\n\n\u201cFor the period of March 2020 to March 2021, a total of 2,911.62bcf of gas was produced, representing an average daily production of 7,409.60mmscfd during the period.\n\n\u201cProduction from Joint Ventures (JVs), Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and NPDC contributed about 63.23 per cent, 19.78 per cent and 63.99 per cent respectively to the total national gas production,\u201d it added.\n\nOn natural gas off-take, commercialisation and utilisation, NNPC stated that out of the 210.55bcf supplied in March 2021, a total of 138.38bcf was commercialised, consisting of 45.42bcf and 92.96bcf for the domestic and export market respectively.\n\n\u201cThis translates to a total supply of 1,465.42mmscfd of gas to the domestic market and 2,998.26mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month.\n\n\u201cThis implies that 63.18 per cent of the average daily gas produced was commercialised while the balance of 36.82 per cent was re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared.\n\n\u201cGas flare rate was 9.50 per cent for the month under review (i.e. 671.13mmscfd) compared to average gas flare rate of 7.25 per cent (i.e. 532.37mmscfd) for the period of March 2020 to March 2021,\u201d the corporation said.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, a total of 844mmscfd was delivered to gas-fired power plants in the month of March 2021 to generate about 3,530mega watts (mw) compared with February 2021 where 825mmscfd was supplied to generate 3,580mw.\n\nThe report also disclosed that the corporation recorded 70 vandalised points across its pipeline network in the period under review, representing 29.63 per cent increase from the 54 points recorded in the previous month.\n\nIt stressed that while the Port Harcourt area accounted for 63 per cent of the vandalised points, the Mosimi area accounted for 21 per cent and the Gombe area accounted for the remaining 16 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, Italian prosecutors and the Nigerian government have appealed the acquittal of Eni and Shell as well as a series of past and present managers, in the Malabu corruption case, according to a Reuters report.\n\nIn March, a Milan court had acquitted the two companies and defendants in the oil industry\u2019s biggest corruption case involving the $1.3 billion acquisition of a Nigerian oilfield a decade ago.\n\nThe federal government said at the time it was surprised and disappointed by the verdict and would consider lodging an appeal in the case which revolved around a deal in which Eni and Shell acquired the Oil Prospecting Licence (OPL) 245 offshore oilfield in 2011 to settle a long-standing dispute over ownership.\n\nProsecutors alleged that just under $1.1 billion of that amount was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen, but the court in Milan said there was no case to answer and acquitted the companies and all other defendants.\n\n\u201cWe have always maintained that the 2011 settlement was legal. We will review the appeal that has been filed,\u201d Reuters quoted a Shell spokesperson as saying.\n\nEni stated that it acknowledged the appeal by the prosecutors and Nigerian government. \u201cWaiting to read the reasons for the appeal; Eni confirms its total extraneousness to the contested facts,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nLast month, two prosecutors in the case were placed under official investigation by magistrates for allegedly not filing documents that would have supported Eni\u2019s position, with Italy\u2019s justice ministry ordering an inquiry into the conduct of the pair.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 With huge population, large market, active labour force, rich natural endowment, continent holds enormous potential\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Group Managing Director/Chief Executive of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, has called for increased impact investing in Nigeria and other countries in Africa, for the continent to attain its full potential.\n\nOnyeagwu made the call in a keynote address at the Africa Investment Risk & Compliance Summit 2021 organised by the Emerging Business Intelligence & Innovation (EBII) Group which held at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, at the weekend.\n\nThe Zenith Bank boss delivered his keynote address after the special keynote address by the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, who was the Special Guest of Honour.\n\nDr Amani ABOU-ZEID, The African Union Commissioner in charge of Infrastructure and Energy, also delivered a keynote address at the Summit.\n\nIn his address with the theme: \u201cLeveraging Impact Investment Opportunities for Growth in Africa,\u201d Onyeagwu described impact investing as an investment that yields optimal returns for investors, value for all stakeholders, and guarantees continued sustenance and existence of humanity.\u201d\n\nHe decried the shallowness of Africa\u2019s financial market as depicted by the fact that no African exchange is among the Morgan Stanley developed markets index; only two African exchanges (Egypt and South Africa) are in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and just six African exchanges are in the MSCI Frontier Market Index.\n\nAccording to him, although the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that the global investors\u2019 appetite for impact investing could total as much as $26 trillion, only approximately eight per cent of the assets of impact intent funds are focused on Africa.\n\nThis he argued was not significant enough, saying Africa appears to be in the room but not on the table, considering that the continent is in dire need of investment and the continent\u2019s 1.3 billion people represent about 17 per cent of the global population of about 7.8 billion.\n\nCiting the immense opportunities in Africa that represent, including the enormous investment proposition for discerning investors huge population, large market and active labour force, and the rich natural endowment, Onyeagwu described Africa as, \u201cthe new frontier\u201d for global growth. He made a case for increased impact investment in Africa, noting that investment opportunities on the continent cut across agriculture, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, electricity, and the creative sectors.\n\nFurthermore, the bank chief exuded immense optimism on the coming into effect of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative, which would create a single, continent-wide market for goods and services, business and investment as being in one country on the continent grants investors access to the entire continent.\n\nHe also called investors\u2019 attention to Africa\u2019s rich natural endowment, which includes 60 per cent of the world\u2019s uncultivated arable land and nine per cent of the world\u2019s freshwater bodies, noting that Africa holds enormous potential for organic food production. He, therefore, implored investors in the agribusiness value chain to focus attention in Africa for organic food production instead of genetically modified food in other climes.\n\nIn addition, he noted that as a socially responsible organisation, Zenith Bank continues to promote impact investment in Africa.\n\nFor example, he said the bank has maintained strong advocacy for investment in Africa through its flagship sponsorship of \u201cInside Africa\u201d on CNN for 16 consecutive years, which is helping to highlight the immense creativity and talent that abound on the continent and the enormous investment opportunities on the continent of Africa.\n\nHe also said that the bank leverages its in-depth knowledge of the African market to guide investors and hedge their exposures.\n\nAccording to him, the bank has been on a steady Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) investment journey, which started with ESG integration as a business strategy as well as being a signatory to the Nigerian Principles for Sustainable Banking and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Principles for Responsible Banking. For its efforts, Onyeagwu noted that Zenith Bank received recognition as the \u201cBest Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in Africa\u201d at the 2020 Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility Awards (SERAS).\n\nIn his call to action, Onyeagwu called for a paradigm shift, noting that Africa is a work in progress, and leaders in the public and private sector should not despair.\n\nHe urged leaders to champion the changes they want to see, pay close attention to responsibility and accountability in leadership. He also called for the de-risking of Africa through reforms, improved ease of doing business, respect for the rule of law and sanctity of contract, and human capital development. Onyeagwu expressed satisfaction with the several reforms of the federal government including the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (RITC), the establishment of the Rural Electrification Agency\u2019s (REA) Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Infraco Plc, and several other development finance initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nHe also noted that several African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda, are recording massive improvements in the ease of doing business, leveraging digital technology to simplify government processes and deepen the financial system.\n\nHe implored Africans to see themselves as brothers and sisters, say no to xenophobia, and speak with one voice and not with discordant tunes.\n\nThe Zenith Bank boss implored the rest of the world to look at Africa as an investment destination that guarantees optimal returns. He noted that Africa has profound talent that abounds across the world and contributes to the development of these climes, and this should be reciprocated. He encouraged Africans to imbibe the spirit of UBUNTU \u2013 \u201cI AM BECAUSE YOU ARE\u201d since we are all connected in humanity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Your Turn To Produce President Will Come After Another Muslim Has Succeeded Buhari\u2014 Islamic Group Tells Christians",
          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has revealed that it is not yet the turn of a Christian to be the President of Nigeria.\n\nThe group, reacting to a recent statement by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) calling for a Christian president for Nigeria by 2023, argued that it was not yet the turn of a Christian based on its calculation.\n\nThis was conveyed on Monday in a statement signed by MURIC Director and Founder, Professor Ishaq Akintola. He explained that the group is not opposed to the idea of a Christian president for Nigeria, but noted that CAN must wait for its turn.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is not yet the turn of a Christian to be the President of Nigeria if we want to go by mathematical exactitude from the time Nigeria began civil rule in 1999,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cChief Mathew Aremu Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, spent eight (8) years as president (1999 \u2013 2007). Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan also spent five (5) years (5th May, 2010 \u2013 29th May, 2015). That brings the total spent by Christian presidents in Aso Rock to thirteen (13) years.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Alhaji Musa Yar'Adua, a Muslim, spent three (3) years as president and the incumbent, President Muhammadu Buhari, will be completing his eighth year in office by the good Grace of Allah on 29th May, 2023. By simple arithmetic, this will bring the total spent by the two Muslim presidents to eleven (11) years.\n\n\u201cMURIC is being generous, otherwise it would have toed the line of those who argue that Jonathan spent six (6) years and that will bring the total number of years spent by Christians to fourteen (14). In the same vein, we would have supported those who said Yar'Adua spent just two (2) years and that would have reduced the number of years spent by Muslims in power to ten (10) years.\n\n\u201cMuslims will be short-changed by two or four years if a Christian becomes president in 2023. The ideal thing is to allow another Muslim to spend only one term from 2023 to 2027. There will be no doubt about who takes the reins of power from 2007 because a Christian must be installed as president at that time. All controversies would have been removed but there is controversy now.\"\n\nThe group advises CAN to wait for its own time and stop heating up the polity with untimely demands.\n\nIt added, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubts, we reiterate our readiness to accept a Christian as president but it must be at the right time. It will be unfair to install a Christian president in 2023 when Muslims still have a shortfall of two or four years. It is the group that has a two-year or four-year shortfall that should be given the chance for a make-up, not the group that has a two-year advantage.\n\n\u201cWe advise CAN to wait for its own time and to stop heating up the polity with untimely demands. CAN should also take a retrospective look at its attitude towards the incumbent since 2015 when a Christian president left the stage. Nigerians are already comparing CAN\u2019s weekly visits to Aso Rock in the days of Jonathan, a Christian president, to turn on the tap of gold and its extremely hostile stance to the incumbent, a Muslim president, since 2015. We really sympathise with CAN but facts are sacred. Figures and dates are sacrosanct.\u201d",
          "summary": "He explained that the group is not opposed to the idea of a Christian president for Nigeria, but noted that CAN must wait for its turn.\n\u201cChief Mathew Aremu Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, spent eight (8) years as president (1999 \u2013 2007).\nBy simple arithmetic, this will bring the total spent by the two Muslim presidents to eleven (11) years.\nIt will be unfair to install a Christian president in 2023 when Muslims still have a shortfall of two or four years.\nCAN should also take a retrospective look at its attitude towards the incumbent since 2015 when a Christian president left the stage.",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-styled, \u201cBank of the Free,\u201d Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda Bank has raised $55 million in Series B funding as it looks to expand into other African countries. It also plans to launch new product offerings for its Nigerian market.\n\nThe funding was made at a $500 million evaluation and comes after raising a $25 million Series A in March 2021 and a $10 million seed round in November 2020. With a $1.6 million pre-seed raise in September 2019 and a $15,000 pre-seed in 2018, its total raise comes to $91.6 million.\n\nThe round was co-led by previous investors, Valar Ventures and Target Global. Other investors that participated include Japan-based Strategic Business Investor (SBI) Investment and past angel investors.\n\nIncorporated in 2018 as Kudimoney, the company changed its name to Kuda just before its $1.6 million raise in 2019. The company is the brainchild of co-founders Babs Ogundeyi and Musty Mustapha, CTO, and was founded as a lending platform before transitioning into a digital bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKuda now has 1.4 million registered users \u2014 more than double the number it had in March when it had 650,000 registered users.\n\nPer TechCrunch, this Series B round was relatively fast as the company was not actively looking to raise money.\n\n\u201cWe felt that Babs and Musty are ambitious on another level. For them, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,\u201d said Ricardo Sch\u00e4fer, Partner at Target Global.\n\nAccording to Ogundeyi, Kuda\u2019s initial business model was built around providing banking services to people who still held accounts with incumbent banks. But this is gradually shifting as more people are paying in and out of their accounts.\n\nAlthough he does not state the countries where Kuda would launch, he hints that its latest product, the Kuda Bank Overdraft is a sign of things to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique product, an overdraft that we pre-qualify the most active users for,\u201d he said. In Q2, it qualified over 200,000 users and pushed out $20 million worth of credit. With a 30-day repayment, he said, so far, default has been \u201cminimal\u201d because of the company\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cWe use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer\u2019s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,\u201d he added.\n\nAndrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures, says, \u201cKuda is our first investment in Africa, and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda\u2019s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting them,\u201d he concludes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day.\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nExpert takes on Nigeria\u2019s eNaira\n\nYele Bademosi stepping down as Bundle CEO\n\nInternational Friendship Day and System Administrators Appreciation Day\n\nTwitter\u2019s bias challenge\n\nExperts talk about Nigeria\u2019s eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@ewankennedy19?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Ewan Kennedy</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-trading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nLast week, we told you that the Central Bank of Nigeria had revealed its intentions to launch the pilot scheme of the country\u2019s digital currency.\n\nThe launch, which is set for October 1 this year, will run on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain \u2014 a private Blockchain network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a lot of questions abound as to how this central bank digital currency (CBDC) will work. Will it be connected to the naira? What roles will financial institutions and fintechs play? Will existing bank accounts be able to store the eNaira? Are there possible privacy violations waiting to happen? Will this affect inflation?\n\nWhile scouring the Internet, I found an interesting gem. According to Bank of America analysts, countries that do not issue CBDCs might face a dropoff in demand for their currency \u2014 the US Dollar and the Euro are at the most risk.\n\nSo, while Nigeria\u2019s decision is shaping up to be a good move, many of our earlier questions remain unanswered.\n\nTo make sense of this puzzle, Bolu Abiodun picked the brains of some of Nigeria\u2019s foremost Blockchain experts. Look out for his story today.\n\nYele Bademosi steps down as Bundle CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 31, 2021, Yele Bademosi announced via a medium post that he was stepping down as CEO of crypto and cash payment platform, Bundle.\n\nFounded in 2019, Bademosi says Bundle currently has a monthly transaction volume of $56 million with over 350,000 customers. Also, the company recently launched its native token in May 2021.\n\nBefore his stint at Bundle, he was the Director of Binance Labs and is currently Managing Partner at Lagos-based VC, Microtraction.\n\nEmmanuel Babalola, Director at Binance Africa, will assume the role of interim CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat next? Although Bademosi does not explicitly state his plans or why he has decided to leave the company barely a year after launch, he hints at possible projects in the Blockchain and crypto space.\n\nHe says, \u201cI will continue to gear my efforts towards supporting and growing the nascent crypto community in Africa and other emerging markets. With all the new and interesting developments happening within the space, I am super excited to see where this journey takes me next.\u201d\n\nTechpoint celebrates Friendship and System Administrators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAristotle likens friendship to a soul inhabiting two bodies. He also says, \u201cWishing to be friends is quick work, but friendship is a slow-ripening fruit.\u201d This is even more true in the ever-evolving world that we live in.\n\nJuly 30, 2021, is International Day of Friendship and to celebrate, we looked at how social media and tech enhance communication among friends.\n\nYou can read here: Two souls in one body \u2014 a look at friendships in the digital age\n\nWe also had a sit-down with a varying group of friends in different age brackets. There was an abundance of laughter, shared looks of age-long familiarity, and deep camaraderie. And we made a video.\n\nYou can watch here: Techpoint Africa celebrates International Day of Friendship 2021\n\nDid you know that System Administrators Appreciation Day is celebrated on the last Friday in July? I bet you didn\u2019t. Like the International Day of Friendship, this year, it was celebrated on July 30.\n\nIt is a day set aside to appreciate system administrators for the tireless and sometimes thankless job they do, putting out IT fires that we inadvertently \u2014 or not \u2014 cause as we work.\n\nSystem administrators troubleshoot all day, every day, trying their best to keep the organisation from burning down while maintaining a semblance of calm.\n\nCheck out our article on their journey, struggles, and everything in between, here: Who puts out your IT fires when you\u2019ve deleted an entire file from the company\u2019s servers?\n\nTwitter announces $3,500 bias bounty challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter has introduced a new competition for researchers and hackers to spot and fix racial and gender bias in its image-cropping algorithm. The company revealed this in a blog post on Friday, July 30, 2021.\n\nThe challenge is part of this year\u2019s DEF CON \u2014 a hackathon started by Jeff Moss in 1993 \u2014 AI village, and the company hopes that the competition will be a radical introduction to the industry. Prizes range from $1,000 to $3,500\n\nDo you remember Twitter announcing that it will no longer crop single, standard aspect ratio photos on mobile devices? #NoCropTwitter\n\nIt then shared its learnings about the image cropping algorithm on May 18, 2021, and opened its source code three days later.\n\nAccording to Twitter employees, Rumman Chowdhury, Director of ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability (META) and Jutta Williams, Product Manager, the company hopes to \u201cidentify potential harms of this algorithm beyond what we identified ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Twitter began investigations into the algorithm after a tweet by PhD student Colin Madland spurred users to test out his theory on the platform being racially biased.\n\nMachine Learning Bias \u2014 sometimes called algorithm or AI bias \u2014 is an issue that has plagued the use of AI, and some experts argue that it will always exist.\n\nHas Twitter done enough to solve the problem? Time will tell.\n\nApplications opened on July 30, 2021, at 9:01 a.m. PT and close on August 6, 2021, at 11:59 p.m. PT.

It had also gotten a $100m investment from Mastercard in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) in April.\n\nAMC BV is a subsidiary of Airtel Africa that functions as the holding company for several of the company\u2019s mobile money operations across 14 African countries.\n\nThe mobile money division is one of the largest financial services providers on the continent. It enables users to make mobile payments, international money transfers, borrow money, and use virtual credit cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, the investment will be used to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries.\n\nThe investment deal will be completed in two tranches, with the first $150m probably in August and $50m at a yet unspecified date.\n\nAirtel Africa says that QIA will hold a minority stake in the company while it retains the majority. However, what\u2019s different in this investment deal is that QIA now has the authority to appoint a director to the board of directors of AMC BV, as well as \u201ccertain customary information and minority protection rights.\u201d\n\nWe reported that the telecommunications company recorded significant growth in revenue between March and December 2020; however, profit after tax dropped.\n\nComparing revenue from Q1 2020 with Q1 2021, Airtel saw a significant increase in revenue at $1.03b, dwarfing Q1 2020\u2019s revenue of $899m by 21.7%.\n\nIn its Q1 financial report, Airtel\u2019s Mobile Money accounted for the least revenue at $110m. However, it surpassed the $83m of Q1 2020 by 38.7%.

          "text": "Prime office space suppliers are not having it easy as they struggle to retain occupancy and seek strategies to get new tenants. Transaction activity, particularly new leases, dropped in the first half of 2021 to the worst levels the market has recorded since the 2016 recession.\n\nOnly 191 square metres were signed in a single transaction within the period, representing a 86 percent decline in the new leases signed in H2:2020. Overall, leasing activity was driven by renewals.\n\nThis transaction, which differs significantly from about 1000sqm pre-Covid-19 market demand, mirrors the current size of requirements in a market still smarting from the effects of social and physical distancing rules.\n\nFoot traffic at office buildings fell under 30 percent within this period, according to a H1: 2021 office market viewpoint by Broll Properties Nigeria. Though some companies still have most of their staff working remotely, this rate is expected to pick up as tenants such as Cisco and Google begin to roll out policies for staff resumption to the office.\n\nEven with a significant drop in rentals, vacancy levels are rising, but the pace of increase is not uniform across different buildings. Average vacancy rate across different market nodes is estimated at 46 percent.\n\nRead also: Investors show risk appetite, snap up 14,500sqm prime office space in Q4\u201918\n\nCiting two prime office buildings in Lagos, The Wings Towers on Ozumba Mbadiew Street in Victoria Island and Heritage Place on Kingsway Road in Ikoyi, Gbenga Olaniyan, CEO, Estate Links, confirms to BusinessDay that Covid-19 has really impacted A-Grade office rentals.\n\nIn 2015, he explains, The Wings Towers was renting for $1,000 per square metre. Pre-Covid, it was on the market for $800 per square metre. But in July 2021, the rent dropped further to $600 per square metre. The story is the same for Heritage Place.\n\nWithin the period under review, both asking and achieved rentals were falling as the nature of transaction activity was limited and hence tenant-friendly.\n\nBroll notes that the market is yet to bottom out as more corporate organisations continue to reevaluate and aspire to optimise their operations in this very challenging economic and business environment.\n\n\u201cMarket fundamentals have remained largely unchanged. Landlords continue to seek aggressive strategies to retain occupancy as vacancy levels gradually increase in some buildings,\u201d Bolaji Edu, Broll Nigeria\u2019s CEO, notes.\n\nAccording to Edu, \u201cOn the tenant side, although we observe some resilience among space occupiers, market exit and space downsizing endure.\u201d\n\nEdu gave a highlight of activities in the A-Grade office market as 117,000sqm total stock, 0sqm completions, 90.09sqm under construction, 191sqm gross take-up, 46 percent total vacancy, professional services being top occupiers while landlords remain price takers.\n\nHe adds that vacancy levels have dropped in Ikoyi to 24 percent, but high in Victoria Island at 67 percent following notable exits.\n\nUnderstandably, limited demand is coming from the tech sector, which used to be a major source of demand for office space. The unintended consequences of Twitter ban are taking a toll on the office market.\n\n\u201cThe office sector is also enduring challenges from a restrictive policy and regulatory environment. The tech sector has been a major driver of activity in this market, with over 50 percent of new leases signed in 2019 being attributed to the sector,\u201d Edun explains.\n\nContinuing, he states, \u201cThe impact of the Twitter ban illustrates a disconnect between the current policy and effective strategies for economic and business progress. Over-regulation in this market, among other factors, could negatively impact the investment potential of Africa\u2019s largest economy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, landlords have continued to manage the effects of an ongoing down market that is yet to bottom out. Favourable lease negotiations continue to characterise the market, and despite this, there were limited new leases signed in the period.\n\nThe period also saw a number of landlords re-start discussions from existing tenants looking to optimise their space occupancy requirements and costs following current business and economic challenges.\n\nThese discussions are still ongoing and although some tenants have been successful in renegotiating their leases in the period, the magnitude effects of further lease renegotiation on landlord\u2019s cash-flows remains a major concern for them.\n\n\u201cWe also observed, in the period, that a number of enquiries circulating in the market were \u2018dummy\u2019 enquiries as existing tenants at prime grade buildings were utilising offers sourced to renegotiate their current leases for more favourable terms,\u201d the Broll CEO reveals.\n\nOutlook for this segment of the market in the next six months is not altogether dim. On the demand side, it is expected that there will be some demand activity in the coming months.\n\nThis would be derived from the state of ongoing transactions in the market and expectations for a slight rekindling of interests that had gone on hold prior to the coronavirus pandemic. But, with more corporates looking to optimise, effectively leading to space reductions, the effects of this is likely to outweigh the former.\n\nOn the supply side, the market expects about 90,000sqm to be delivered in the next six to 36 months. This pipeline continues to be a cause for concern for existing landlords due to higher competition for limited demand and its impact on rents and landlord cash flows.\n\nThe good news however is that following this, there will be tenant-friendly leases in the short to medium term. But this will depend on future workplace policies as well as macro and policy factors such as currency and GDP growth performance.\n\nRents remain dicey. \u201cWhile asking rents are likely to remain unchanged in the coming months, we expect further decline in achievable rents with as high as 20-30 percent disparity between these rental values and initial rental offers,\u201d Edu states.",

Igbinidu, Monday Iduoriyekemwen and Elder John Eware, the community said the land was dubiously taken from the community some time ago by Ize-Iyamu.\n\nAccording to the community, \u201cWe, the indigenes of Amagba Community in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State, wish to express our appreciation to Governor Godwin Obaseki for listening and hearkening to our pleas expressed in the various protest letters written to him on the injustice and oppression meted on us by Osagie Ize-Iyamu.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are indeed grateful for the Governor\u2019s intervention and move to revoke the Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) on a land measuring over 18 hectares, which was dubiously taken from us some time ago by the said individual.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWe hereby state, without equivocation that the said expanse of land, amounting to over 18 hectares did not wholly belong to Ize-Iyamu because portions of it were allocated to other individuals.\n\n\u201cThe portion of the land within the 18 hectares to which Ize-Iyamu laid claim, hitherto awarded to him by the community, has since been revoked by the people and leaders of Amagba, after several letters by the people and a final letter written to him by the legal representative of the Amagba Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a community, we decided to withdraw the large expanse of land over which Ize-Iyamu sat, under the guise of setting up an Agricultural Institution to create jobs as well as open up the area for increased economic activities,\u201d they added.\n\nThe community accused Ize-Iyamu of employing deceit when acquiring the land, noting, \u201cIt turned out that Ize-Iyamu only used the proposed agricultural institution to deceitfully acquire the land from the community, because in fact, there has never been any activity on the said parcel for these many years: Rather, the place, having been left unused, has become a den of criminals, posing severe security and safety threat to women, children and the entire people of Amagba Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that, even before the community began to solicit the intervention of the governor, several engagements have been ongoing to draw Ize-Iyamu\u2019s attention to the need to vacate the said property, having failed to put it to use for the purpose for which it was allocated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have, over the years, endured the pain and agony of the domination of Mr. Ize-Iyamu, who has depended on his political clout and connection with successive governments, to deprive us of the purposeful use of our land and also put our lives in danger, having left such a vast land unused in the midst of a thriving community, thereby making the land a cover for armed robbers, rapists, hoodlums, among others,\u201d they said.\n\nThey praised the governor for his decision, adding, \u201cWe are therefore immensely grateful to his Excellency, Mr. Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki, for his intervention in revoking the land title and opening up opportunities for the land to be used by government to advance the development of Amagba community and its environs.\n\n\u201cThe people of Amagba also acknowledge the numerous developmental projects embarked upon by the Governor in our community, including the over 15km Ugbor-Amagba Road, which has since been completed, as well as several other adjoining roads that have been constructed. We, once more, reaffirm our unflinching support for the Governor for his interest in the development of Amagba Community and appeal that these efforts be sustained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Zenith Bank MD, Onyeagwu seeks impact investment for Africa\u2019s development at global summit",
          "text": "Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive of Zenith Bank, has called for increased impact investing in Africa for the continent to attain its full potential. He made the call during his keynote address at the Africa Investment Risk & Compliance Summit 2021 organised by the Emerging Business Intelligence & Innovation (EBII) Group which held at the prestigious University of Oxford, United Kingdom, on Friday, July 30, 2021. Mr Onyeagwu delivered his keynote address after the special keynote address by His Excellency, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana & Commander-in-Chief of the Ghana Armed Forces, who was the Special Guest of Honour. Her Excellency Dr Amani ABOU-ZEID, The African Union Commissioner in charge of Infrastructure and Energy, also delivered a keynote address at the Summit.\n\nDelivering the keynote address with the theme \u201cLeveraging Impact Investment Opportunities for Growth in Africa\u201d, Onyeagwu described impact investing as an investment that yields optimal returns for investors, value for all stakeholders, and guarantees continued sustenance and existence of humanity. He decried the shallowness of Africa\u2019s financial market as depicted by the fact that no African exchange is among the Morgan Stanley developed markets index, only two African exchanges (Egypt and South Africa) are in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and just six African exchanges are in the MSCI Frontier Market Index. He noted that although the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that the global investors\u2019 appetite for impact investing could total as much as $26 trillion, only approximately 8% of the assets of impact intent funds are focused on Africa. According to him, this is not significant enough, and Africa appears to be in the room but not on the table, considering that Africa is in dire need of investment and the continent\u2019s 1.3 billion people represent about 17% of the global population of about 7.8 billion.\n\nCiting the immense opportunities in Africa that represent enormous investment proposition for discerning investors, including the huge population, large market and active labour force, and the rich natural endowment, Onyeagwu described Africa as \u201cthe new frontier\u201d for global growth. He made a case for increased impact investment in Africa, noting that investment opportunities on the continent cut across agriculture, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, electricity, and the creative sectors.\n\nOnyeagwu exuded immense optimism on the coming into effect of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative, which would create a single, continent-wide market for goods and services, business and investment as being in one country on the continent grants investors access to the entire continent. He also called investors\u2019 attention to Africa\u2019s rich natural endowment, which includes 60% of the world\u2019s uncultivated arable land and 9% of the world\u2019s freshwater bodies, noting that Africa holds enormous potential for organic food production. He, therefore, implored investors in the agribusiness value chain to focus attention in Africa for organic food production instead of genetically modified food in other climes.\n\nOnyeagwu also noted that as a socially responsible organisation, Zenith Bank continues to promote impact investment in Africa. For example, the bank has maintained strong advocacy for investment in Africa through its flagship sponsorship of \u201cInside Africa\u201d on CNN for 16 consecutive years, which is helping to highlight the immense creativity and talent that abound on the continent and the enormous investment opportunities on the continent of Africa. He also said that the bank leverages its in-depth knowledge of the African market to guide investors and hedge their exposures. According to him, the bank has been on a steady Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) investment journey, which started with ESG integration as a business strategy as well as being a signatory to the Nigerian Principles for Sustainable Banking and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Principles for Responsible Banking. For its efforts, Onyeagwu noted that Zenith Bank received recognition as the \u201cBest Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in Africa\u201d at the 2020 Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility Awards (SERAS).\n\nIn his call to action, Onyeagwu called for a paradigm shift, noting that Africa is a work in progress, and leaders in the public and private sector should not despair. He encouraged leaders to champion the changes they want to see, pay close attention to responsibility and accountability in leadership. He also called for the de-risking of Africa through reforms, improved ease of doing business, respect for the rule of law and sanctity of contract, and human capital development. Onyeagwu expressed satisfaction with the several reforms of the Federal Government of Nigeria, including the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (RITC), the establishment of the Rural Electrification Agency\u2019s (REA) Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Infraco Plc, and several other development finance initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He also noted that several African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda, are recording massive improvements in the ease of doing business, leveraging digital technology to simplify government processes and deepen the financial system.\n\nHe implored Africans to see themselves as brothers and sisters, say no to xenophobia, and speak with one voice and not with discordant tunes. Onyeagwu implored the rest of the world to look at Africa as an investment destination that guarantees optimal returns. He noted that Africa has profound talent that abounds across the world and contributes to the development of these climes, and this should be reciprocated. He encouraged Africans to imbibe the spirit of UBUNTU \u2013 \u201cI AM BECAUSE YOU ARE\u201d since we are all connected in humanity.\n\nZenith Bank is Nigeria\u2019s largest and one of Africa\u2019s largest financial institutions by tier-1 capital, with shareholders\u2019 funds in excess of NGN1.1 trillion ($2.64 billion) as at December 31, 2020. The bank is a clear leader in the Nigerian financial space, with several firsts in the deployment of innovative products and solutions that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.\n\nThe Emerging Business Intelligence & Innovation (EBII) Group is an independent specialist compliance and global risk management consultancy firm offering education and expert consulting services to entities in the West seeking opportunities for diversification and growth in emerging markets and Africa. The Group supports African entities and governments with their risk management and compliance requirements and delivers practical and genuine support to firms by providing a comprehensive and relevant assessment of risks, enabling them to successfully navigate their risks and ensure adherence to their compliance requirements.",

          "title": "Opinion: On Rising Unemployment and Poverty in Nigeria \u2013 By DANIEL IGHAKPE",
          "text": "Unemployment and poverty are two of the major issues currently affecting Nigeria\u2019s economy and its society. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the population of the unemployed in Nigeria during the last quarter of 2020 (Q4 2020) stood at 33.3 percent \u2013 an increase of 6.2 percent points compared with the 27.1 percent of quarter two 2020 (Q2 2020). This places Nigeria in the number three position among countries with the highest number of unemployed people in the world! Also, according to data from the World Poverty Clock (a Web tool produced by World Data Lab), the number of people living in extreme poverty in Nigeria rose from 86.9 million in 2018, to 93.7 million in 2019, thus Nigeria stands as the nation with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty across the world!\n\nThis trend of unemployment and poverty is projected to worsen, as the World Data Lab noted that the outlook for poverty alleviation in Nigeria is weak, and that an estimated 120 million Nigerians are expected to slip into extreme poverty by 2030.\n\nWhat could help to improve this situation of rising unemployment and poverty in Nigeria? A revival of the agricultural sector in Nigeria is one suggestion that has been put forth. Another dominant thought amongst local economists is that if the country\u2019s manufacturing sector is properly developed it can absorb a large number of the labour force, thereby reducing the high population of the unemployed.\n\nOther palliative measures have also been recommended to reduce the suffering of the poor. For example, in an interesting three-part \u2018Viewpoint\u2019 column published in the Vanguard newspapers some years ago, a prominent Nigerian, Aare Afe Babalola (the founder of a well-known private university in Nigeria \u2013 Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD)), highlighted the importance of giving/generosity/philanthropy in alleviating the suffering of the poor in Nigeria.\n\nAmong other things, he stated in his writings that, \u201calthough many factors can and have been adduced as partly responsible for the state of poverty in Nigeria, what makes poverty so endemic in Nigeria is partly the poor disposition of Nigerians to giving.\u201d He said \u201cgovernment alone cannot reasonably be expected, particularly in the light of the world\u2019s current economic realities, to improve the quality of life of everyone to the level which most people expect. Wealthy individuals can aid government in the provision of amenities of life to the less privileged. The rich in our society should imbibe the culture of giving. Philanthropy is rooted in love and compassion; it is of immense benefit not only to the person who practices it but also to the beneficiary and the society at large.\u201d\n\nSometime ago, a group of activists sought the institution of a \u2018Universal Basic Income\u2019 (UBI) and polled over 200,000 signatures to drive home their demand.

          "title": "Opinion: On Rising Unemployment and Poverty in Nigeria \u2013 By DANIEL IGHAKPE",
          "text": "Unemployment and poverty are two of the major issues currently affecting Nigeria\u2019s economy and its society. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the population of the unemployed in Nigeria during the last quarter of 2020 (Q4 2020) stood at 33.3 percent \u2013 an increase of 6.2 percent points compared with the 27.1 percent of quarter two 2020 (Q2 2020). This places Nigeria in the number three position among countries with the highest number of unemployed people in the world! Also, according to data from the World Poverty Clock (a Web tool produced by World Data Lab), the number of people living in extreme poverty in Nigeria rose from 86.9 million in 2018, to 93.7 million in 2019, thus Nigeria stands as the nation with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty across the world!\n\nThis trend of unemployment and poverty is projected to worsen, as the World Data Lab noted that the outlook for poverty alleviation in Nigeria is weak, and that an estimated 120 million Nigerians are expected to slip into extreme poverty by 2030.\n\nWhat could help to improve this situation of rising unemployment and poverty in Nigeria? A revival of the agricultural sector in Nigeria is one suggestion that has been put forth. Another dominant thought amongst local economists is that if the country\u2019s manufacturing sector is properly developed it can absorb a large number of the labour force, thereby reducing the high population of the unemployed.\n\nOther palliative measures have also been recommended to reduce the suffering of the poor. For example, in an interesting three-part \u2018Viewpoint\u2019 column published in the Vanguard newspapers some years ago, a prominent Nigerian, Aare Afe Babalola (the founder of a well-known private university in Nigeria \u2013 Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD)), highlighted the importance of giving/generosity/philanthropy in alleviating the suffering of the poor in Nigeria.\n\nAmong other things, he stated in his writings that, \u201calthough many factors can and have been adduced as partly responsible for the state of poverty in Nigeria, what makes poverty so endemic in Nigeria is partly the poor disposition of Nigerians to giving.\u201d He said \u201cgovernment alone cannot reasonably be expected, particularly in the light of the world\u2019s current economic realities, to improve the quality of life of everyone to the level which most people expect. Wealthy individuals can aid government in the provision of amenities of life to the less privileged. The rich in our society should imbibe the culture of giving. Philanthropy is rooted in love and compassion; it is of immense benefit not only to the person who practices it but also to the beneficiary and the society at large.\u201d\n\nSometime ago, a group of activists sought the institution of a \u2018Universal Basic Income\u2019 (UBI) and polled over 200,000 signatures to drive home their demand. The movement renewed the call for the establishment of basic income guarantee as an essential part of modern economies.\n\nUBI, as an economic philosophy, dates back to hundreds of years ago and was central to the concept of utopian society. In recent years, some European governments had to test its popularity through referendums. But it has never been given more attention as a tool for building inclusive economic growth than it is now.\n\nIn the recent United States election, Andrew Yang, a Democratic Party presidential aspirant, shot to the international podium for his sermon on UBI and how he planned to pay the poor a monthly stipend of $1000 each, if he emerged the U.S president.

According to the refinery\u2019s unaudited results for the period, Gross profit grew double digit at 37.3 percent to N28.59 billion compared to N20.82 billion at the preceding year due to better topline performance.\n\nGroup sales volume increased to 388,589 tonnes while production volume also increased by 7.6 percent to 403,846 tonnes driven by operations optimization drive.\n\nCommenting on the Company\u2019s half year 2021 performance, the Group Managing Director/CEO, Ravindra Singhvi said; \u201cWe commenced the year on a strong footing with impressive performance in first half as the financial results have shown, with a stronger Q1 topline growth and a robust Q2 topline growth year on year.\n\nDuring the period under review we launched our new packaging designs for the 50kg fortified and non-fortified sugar bags with the theme \u201cDangote Sugar has a new look\u2026. Same Great Quality\u201d. The theme reaffirms the quality of our product and inspires a deeper connection to the Dangote Sugar brand among our valued customers and consumers, whilst refreshing our market presence as the leading sugar brand in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201c\u2026as part of our Supply Chain Management Sustainability journey, we continued to enhance our Outgrowers Scheme. The technical and agriculture support provided for them over time has led to the improved yield from our Outgrowers sugarcane farms at the Numan Sugar Estate. This effort will be sustained to ensure the socioeconomic growth of our immediate communities and improved sugar cane supply for production.\n\nThe team is committed to navigate the second half of the year, keeping the health and safety of our people and partners as top priority. Our Refinery in Apapa and Backward Integration Operations in Numan, Adamawa State and Tunga, Nasarawa State continue to operate in compliance with our health and safety protocols while ensuring our commitment to the environment and sustainable business practices are maintained.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the recurrent challenges with Apapa traffic gridlock persisted during the 1st half of the year but expressed optimism that the truck call up system will address the situation.

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nAll eyes are on the scheduled meeting today between the Federal Government and Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), with Nigerians hoping the dialogue will avert another strike.\n\nASUU went on strike in 2020 for nine months. The strike was called off in December.\n\nThe Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations at the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, said the minister Chris Ngige, will host the leadership of the ASUU to a meeting at the ministry\u2019s conference room, Federal Secretariat in Abuja today.\n\n\u201cThe Minister for Labour and Employment Dr. Chris Ngige will be hosting a meeting with ASUU. The meeting is scheduled for Monday, August 2, 2021 at Minister\u2019s Conference Room,\u201d Akpan said.\n\nChairmen of ASUU branches had warned they would proceed on a fresh strike over the non-implementation of their agreement with FG on IPPIS.\n\nDr Ibrahim Inuwa, ASUU Chairman Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, said its long strike was suspended last December after the two parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the various issues.\n\nThe parties also agreed timelines for the implementation of each of the eight items in the agreement.\n\nInuwa said since then, only two out of the eight issues had been addressed,\n\nOutstanding issues, according to him are the payment of the earned academic allowance, funding for revitalisation of public universities, salary shortfall, proliferation of state universities and setting up of visitation panels.\n\nOthers are replacement of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System with the University Transparency and Accountability Solution and withheld salaries and non-remittance of check-off dues.\n\nThe National President, ASUU, Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, had told The PUNCH that the union was invited by the Ministry of Labour to discuss issues surrounding the Memorandum of Action, which was signed with the Federal Government in December 2020.\n\nHowever, Osodeke, explained the last time the union met with the government was around March/April.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Education, which is our ministry, has not called us to any meeting since we signed the Memorandum of Action. But the Ministry of Labour, which is just an intervention ministry, around March/April called us to a meeting in which we discussed and they promised to implement all those things.\u201d\n\nIn June, chairman of ASUU at UNIJOS had threatened a new strike if the 13 months\u2019 salaries of over 1,000 of its members across the country were not paid.\n\nDr. Lazarus Maigoro accused the Federal Government of withholding the check-off dues of the affected members.\n\nHe accused Ahmed Idris, the Accountant General of Federation (AGF), for systematically denying the lecturers their remuneration, even after government and the union had reached an agreement on non-victimisation of its members following their last strike.\n\nThe chairman alleged that the affected members were being threatened to either enrol into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform, or have their salaries withheld.\n\nHe said despite the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari, that members of the union be paid their full remuneration, the AGF had denied the affected union members their pay, in complete violation of the terms of the agreement signed between the union and government.\n\nMaigoro said that the office of the AGF had continued to feed the public and some sections of government with false reasons over the matter, such as incorrect BVN numbers, incorrectly spelt names and their sequential arrangement, among others.\n\nHe, however, added that such excuses were not tenable, because the bursary departments of their various institutions had submitted the names severally to the authorities, but the problem had continued to persist.\n\n\u201cASUU wants to bring to the attention of the Nigerian public the deliberate, systematic and unpatriotic actions of the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, on the future of education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201d Idris, from all intent and purposes, is bent on withholding the salaries of over 1,000 members of ASUU spread across the country, with more than 100 of such lecturers being members of our branch at the University of Jos.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because they participated in the last strike and refused to enrol in the much discredited IPPIS, despite the non-victimisation clause signed in the Memorandum of Action (MoA) that led to the suspension of the strike in December 2020.\n\n\u201cDespite the directive given by Mr President to pay the salaries of all lecturers, the AGF has refused to pay their salaries, for periods ranging from four to thirteen months, respectively.\n\n\u201dMore worrisome is the fact that while the AGF is refusing to pay the salaries, his staff are busy calling the affected lecturers and insisting they have to register with IPPIS before they are paid; some are even asked to forfeit a part of their salaries in order to be paid. So, it is very clear that this is a deliberate act on the part of the AGF and his staff.\n\n\u201cMany of our members at the University of Jos have not been paid salaries from February 2020 till date. How they are expected to go to the classroom and teach beats my imagination.\n\n\u201cIt is not news, that our union has vowed to fight back at any cost in order to salvage our colleagues from his tyranny and unpatriotic act against not just ASUU members, but the future of education in Nigeria and so, if nothing is urgently done, we will be forced to take action,\u201d Maigoro said.\n\n\u201cApart from the refusal to pay the salaries of our members, the lack of payment of allowances of sabbatical, visiting, part-time, contract staff is further killing the federal universities in Nigeria, and this is all because of IPPIS.\n\n\u201cWe hope that whatever decision the union takes, will not be misconstrued by the Nigerian public, especially seeing the seeming silence of the public and the government over the complete violation of our 2020 MoA,\u201d he said",

          "text": "We have insisted on due process and the presentation of hard evidence before my friend and brother Sunday Igboho can be extradited from Cotonou to Nigeria.\n\nWe have condemned the illegal manner in which the Kenyan authorities kidnapped Nnamdi Kanu and returned him to Nigeria.\n\nThose that complain about us asking for due process & insisting on the presentation of hard evidence before a court of law before Abba Kyari can be extradicted to America are myopic and naive. You cannot insist on due process for Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu & deny it to Abba Kyari.\n\nYou cannot be selective in your application of justice. You cannot have it both ways: you either believe in the rule of law or you do not. You either believe in due process, fairness, equity and justice or you do not. We stood up for Allen Onyeama of Air Peace when the Americans wanted his head. In the end he was vindicated as there was no hard evidence against him and we discovered that the whole thing was a conspiracy to destroy him and take over his business. Why should we not accord Abba the same benefit of the doubt or protection given the fact that he is also a Nigerian. Or is it that some Nigerians are more equal than others? The fact that Abba is a policeman or a northern Muslim does not mean we should feed him to the dogs. The fact that he was in SARS does not mean we should crucify him.\n\nResigning our sovereignty to America and acting as if they are God by considering one of our own guilty simply because they have indicted him or wish to investigate him is utterly shameful. I accord the same presumption of innocence unless and until proven guilty by a court of law to Abba as I do to Sunday and Nnamdi. I refuse to apply the rules and the law selectively. I refuse to allow my emotions to becloud my better judgement. I refuse to associate myself with any witch hunt or to be infected by a herd and lynch mob mentality.\n\nThis is because I have been a victim of such myself many times in the past and I know what it is like. We are all equal before the law and we must not apply it selectively or on a regional, religious or ethnic basis. It is Sunday, Abba and Nnamdi today: it could be you tomorrow.\n\nAnd when that happens the only thing left to protect you from injustice are God and the law. Morale of the tale: always be cautious before you condemn and assume guilt and always insist on hearing the other side of the story and seeing the evidence before you accept the assertions and allegations of either the state or an individual as being true and valid.\n\nThere is nothing more grievous before God than to send an innocent man to the gallows or to wrongly accuse the innocent and it comes with curses.",

          "text": "Professor Attahiru Muhammad Jega, a university professor and former Chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission of Nigeria ( INEC), has urged Nigerians not to vote for the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) in the future, citing their alleged failure to bring about the desired growth and development in Nigeria over the past 20 years.\n\nHe claimed that the two major political parties were like Siamese twins, and that Nigerians needed to find a legitimate alternative.\n\n\u201d Nigerians should dump the two parties because of their bad antecedents over the last 20 years. Looking at their inability to change the economic fortunes of Nigeria for 20 years now, it is now apparently clear that they would not do anything even if Nigerians vote for any of the two parties again,\u201dhe alleged.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the BBC Hausa monitored by our correspondent in Kaduna, Jega explained that \u201d the bad things these parties committed in those past years, Nigerians should never give their trust to the parties again. It is now very clear that these parties would never change, even if they are given another chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe APC and PDP have formed governments, we were all witnesses. They did not come with a good intention to make amends. If you look at the fight against corruption, all these corrupt people that were supposed to be prosecuted sneaked into the APC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are hearing nothing. That is why I\u2019ve since registered with the Peoples Redemption Party( PRP). I am now a PRP member looking for ways to help the Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201d That is why we believe now is the time to establish a platform where every good Nigerian should join and contribute towards building the nation on the right path,\u201d he said.\n\nHe alleged that those in the major political parties have destroyed everything and had made the parties so stigmatized that whichever good person joins the parties would be considered like them.\n\nHe said that was why \u201cit has now become imperative to have a new platform where good Nigerians will constitute the membership.\u201d\n\nJega also alleged that it was lack of good leadership in Nigeria that threw the nation into it current problems, which have led to the series of agitations for the country to be balkanized.\n\n\u201d Since 1979 I\u2019ve been teaching in the university, for 40 years now. So, from what I read and observed, when I was Chairman of INEC, honestly the way I see our politicians conducting elections and from the manner they represent their people when elected, honestly it is something to be afraid of,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has advised the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) that a Christian being elected President of Nigeria is still a long way off.\n\nMURIC claimed it was relying on mathematical precision since Nigeria\u2019s civil rule began in 1999 to prove its point.\n\nThe group was responding to a recent statement by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in which the country\u2019s largest Christian organization called for a Christian president by 2023.\n\nWhile MURIC is not opposed to the notion of a Christian president for Nigeria, it says CAN must wait its turn, according to a statement signed by its Director and Founder, Professor Ishaq Akintola, on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is not yet the turn of a Christian to be the President of Nigeria if we want to go by mathematical exactitude from the time Nigeria began civil rule in 1999,\u201d the group added.\n\n\u201cChief Mathew Aremu Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, spent eight (8) years as president (1999 \u2013 2007). Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan also spent five (5) years (5th May, 2010 \u2013 29th May, 2015). That brings the total spent by Christian presidents in Aso Rock to thirteen (13) years.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Alhaji Musa Yaradua, a Muslim, spent three (3) years as president and the incumbent, President Muhammadu Buhari, will be completing his eighth year in office by the good Grace of Allah on 29th May, 2023. By simple arithmetic, this will bring the total spent by the two Muslim presidents to eleven (11) years.\n\n\u201cMURIC is being generous, otherwise it would have towed the line of those who argue that Jonathan spent six (6) years and that will bring the total number of years spent by Christians to fourteen (14). In the same vein, we would have supported those who said Yaradua spent just two (2) years and that would have reduced the number of years spent by Muslims in power to ten (10) years.\n\n\u201cMuslims will be shortchanged by two or four years if a Christian becomes president in 2023. The ideal thing is to allow another Muslim to spend only one term from 2023 to 2027. There will be no doubt about who takes the reins of power from 2007 because a Christian must be installed as president at that time. All controversies would have been removed but there is controversy now.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubts, we reiterate our readiness to accept a Christian as president but it must be at the right time. It will be unfair to install a Christian president in 2023 when Muslims still have a shortfall of two or four years. It is the group that has a two-year or four-year shortfall that should be given the chance for a make-up, not the group that has a two-year advantage.\n\n\u201cWe advise CAN to wait for its own time and to stop heating up the polity with untimely demands. CAN should also take a retrospective look at its attitude towards the incumbent since 2015 when a Christian president left the stage. Nigerians are already comparing CAN\u2019s weekly visits to Aso Rock in the days of Jonathan, a Christian president, to turn on the tap of gold and its extremely hostile stance to the incumbent, a Muslim president, since 2015. We really sympathise with CAN but facts are sacred. Figures and dates are sacrosanct.\u201d",

          "text": "However, this development is largely predicated on the fact that the FG is presently in a serious dilemma, following its latest disastrous handling of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s s BAIT.\n\nFurther, I make bold to assert that the Criminal Abduction, Detention, Torture and Extraordinary Rendition of MNK is a Disastrous and Costly Blunder, which now constitutes a Big Bone, dangerously lodged in the Throat of the inept Federal Government of Major General Muhammadu Buhari (Retired).\n\nNevertheless, the International responses and/or consequences of this latest blunder by the Buhari Government will surely be a Case Study for Researchers and Students of International Relations and International Law. Just as the Decisions of both Local and International Courts that will be involved, would have serious Implications on International Law Jurisprudence.\n\nFurthermore, the failure of the FG to bring MNK to Court on July 26, 2021, to face the charges it brought against him, as ordered by the Trial Judge, as well as Its resort to cheap propaganda and irresponsible media trial, through its Traditional Media Hirelings as well as paid analysts, newspapers columnist and internet warriors; constitutes a Gross Abuse of the Court Process and a mockery of Nigeria\u2019s Criminal Justice Administration.\n\nSuffice it, that every right-thinking person from Eastern Nigeria, who CANNOT see that MNK is the FACE OF A COURAGEOUS BATTLE FOR THE TOTAL EMANCIPATION OF EASTERN NIGERIA; is either indulging in Self Delusion, a Simple Ignoramus (Intellectually Indolent), or a DIABOLICAL POLITICAL/ Business/ RELIGIOUS LEADER. The Undeniable fact is that the Existential Battle before the Land and People of Eastern Nigeria is not about Mazi Nnamdi Kanu or his ways and manners. Far from it. As Mosses in the Holy Bible, MNK may not even get to the promised land. He may also get there. But, you never know, as his life and mission on Earth, even as it concerns Eastern Nigeria/Biafra is in the hands of the Almighty God and must conform to the Dictates of the Almighty God\u2019s Divine Order. And presently, whether anyone likes his Personality or Not, I wish to emphasize that MNK Represents the FACE of a Courageous Battle for the Total emancipation of Eastern Nigeria/Biafra, by his beleaguered Generation.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that I already alerted the People of Eastern Nigeria/Biafra, to be wary of the oncoming Propaganda Onslaught and Media Trial by the Federal Government, in my maiden Press Statement, following the Criminal Abduction, Detention, Torture and Extraordinary Rendition of MNK by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nNonetheless, as a Peace and Conflict Theorist, I have always advocated for Peacefully Negotiated Settlement of all disputes, because it is the ONLY Route to ending violent conflicts, without the risk of recurrence; thereby bringing the much desired sustainable peace, necessary for Africa\u2019s development.\n\nI, hereby recommend as follows:\n\nA) The Federal Government of Nigeria should immediately commence the processes of returning to the only Authentic 1963 Republican Constitution of Nigeria, as well as the 1960 Constitution of Eastern Nigerian;\n\nOr\n\nB) immediately commence the processes of conducting a Referendum for the Sovereign State of Biafra, throughout the length and Breadth of Eastern Nigeria, before the Richard Constitution of 1946.\n\nCharles Obinna Chukwuanru, PhD\n\nPresident,\n\nEastern Nigeria Development Association\n\n(ENDA)",

          "text": "Madagascar is facing her worst hunger situation in two generations with children wasting away and families in the South teetering on the brink of starvation, Save the Children has said.\n\nThe agency in a statement on Monday warns that without urgent intervention, mothers will be unable to feed themselves or their babies.\n\nMadagascar is currently facing its worst drought in 40 years, caused by years of failed rains, and intensified by a series of sandstorms and locust attacks. One in six children under five are now suffering from acute malnutrition, with numbers rising to one in four children in the six most affected districts.\n\nMany families who used to depend on agriculture have now left their homes for nearby towns, putting pressure on already stretched resources.\n\nSave the Children has deployed a team to southern Madagascar to provide cash support to 1600 households in Ambovombe, with an aim to support at least 30,000 people, including at least 18,000 children. The organisation will focus on ensuring children and their families have access to nutritious food and to child protection.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing people fetching water from puddles on the road or using water from stagnant ponds for drinking and cooking. Parents and children are sometimes walking for miles every day to collect whatever water is available. Just to sell it, in order to get a bowl of rice or a few tuber vegetables on the table. One meal a day is not enough for an adult, and it certainly is not enough for growing kids. The high birth rate and many teen pregnancies make households even more vulnerable,\u201d Save the Children\u2019s Country Director for Kenya & Madagascar, Yvonne Arunga said in a statement obtained by ARISE News.\n\n\u201cThis is a forgotten and very underfunded crisis, and its hitting children hardest \u2013 not only are they missing the nutrients to develop properly, they are missing school due to hunger and the inability of their parents to pay for school fees. Cash and food distributed is just enough to help people survive and stand on their feet, but barely enough to help them recover or consider alternative livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing many hungry, dead-eyed young children, scrounging for a scrap to eat. How can the world look away?\u201d\n\nThe statement added that \u201cSave the Children is calling on donor governments to urgently fund the response in Madagascar, and support health and nutrition services for children in the worst-hit districts, including the treatment of acute malnutrition. The organisation is urging donors to prioritise humanitarian cash and voucher assistance for families to avoid a total collapse of livelihoods and save lives.\n\n\u201cCritically, Save the Children is also calling on donors to ensure children are kept safe during this crisis, and to recognise the increased risk of violence and abuse against children as a result of rising pressures on families.\u201d\n\nThe crisis in Madagascar comes at a time when the world is facing its biggest hunger crisis of the 21st century, with an estimated 5.7 million children under five on the brink of starvation across the globe. A further 13 million children under 18 are facing extreme food shortages, the organisation said.\n\nA deadly combination of COVID-19, conflicts, and the impacts of climate change have pushed hunger and malnutrition levels to a record global high. Without urgent action, the world could see tens of thousands of children starving to death, reversing decades of progress.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
