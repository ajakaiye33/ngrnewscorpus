But in line with International Women\u2019s Day, the female custodial facilities commemorated International Women\u2019s Day with inmates, various inmates without distinction or discrimination against anybody \u2013 an inmate is an inmate.\n\n.\n\n\u201cAll the inmates in different cell blocks presented various programmes. Some did theatre presentations, others drama, some poetry, some beauty pageant, some drawings, paintings, comedy. So, various blocks won. It was just like an inter-cell block event.\n\n\u201cThere were lots of presentations. It was not an individual thing. It was just the facility\u2019s way of trying to reform the inmates, those still in custody.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why they commemorated International Women\u2019s Day, that\u2019s why it was done in the female facility, not the male\u2019s.\u201d\n\nReferring to Ojukwu, the spokesman said: \u201cThe particular inmate, I don\u2019t know her name. There were various winners.\n\n\u201cThe costumes were made by the inmates in the facility and some of the winners got sponsorship to pay for their UME forms, NECO, WASSCE and higher education.\n\nSome donated libraries to us, apart from some other stationery, and welfare resources. It was not an individual event, so the prizes were collective.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that Chidinma could have been a representative of a block.\n\n\u201cThere were representatives for each block, so maybe the inmate you are referring to was one of such representatives, but it was not an individual event, it was a collective one commemorating International Women\u2019s Day,\u201d Oladokun stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Why we let Chidinma, others compete in beauty pageant \u2013 Prisons\n\nThe Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), formerly known as Nigerian Prison Service, has explained why it permitted a 300-level Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos, Chidinma Ojukwu, and other inmates at its facilities to participate in a beauty pageant.\n\nOjukwu, prime suspect in the alleged murder of the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV, Usifo Ataga in June 2021, is standing trial for the offence at the Lagos High Court, Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), Lagos.\n\nPictures of the pageant have flooded social media since Wednesday and sent tongues wagging on the propriety or otherwise of allowing non-convicts such as Miss Ojukwu to participate in the event.\n\nThe beauty pageant held within the NCoS\u2019 Kirikiri facility on Tuesday, March 8, 2022.\n\nOjukwu was said to have been crowned Miss Cell 2022.\n\nBut the NCoS Lagos State Command said the pageant was only one of several other activities organised to mark International Women\u2019s Day (IWD).\n\nIWD is celebrated annually on March 8, to commemorate the social, political and economic achievements of women.\n\nThe Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PRO) Rotimi Oladokun told The Nation that the pageant and all the other events were open to all female inmates whether convicted or awaiting trial.\n\nOladookun, a Superintendent, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the pictures you are talking about. But in line with International Women\u2019s Day, the female custodial facilities commemorated International Women\u2019s Day with inmates, various inmates without distinction or discrimination against anybody \u2013 an inmate is an inmate.\n\n\u201cAll the inmates in different cell blocks presented various programmes. Some did theatre presentations, others drama, some poetry, some beauty pageant, some drawings, paintings, comedy. So, various blocks won. It was just like an inter-cell block event.\n\n\u201cThere were lots of presentations. It was not an individual thing. It was just the facility\u2019s way of trying to reform the inmates, those still in custody.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why they commemorated International Women\u2019s Day, that\u2019s why it was done in the female facility, not the male\u2019s.\u201d\n\nReferring to Ojukwu, the spokesman said: \u201cThe particular inmate, I don\u2019t know her name. There were various winners.\n\n\u201cThe costumes were made by the inmates in the facility and some of the winners got sponsorship to pay for their UME forms, NECO, WASSCE and higher education.\n\n\u201cSome donated libraries to us, apart from some other stationery, and welfare resources. It was not an individual event, so the prizes were collective.\u201d\n\nHe explained that Chidinma could have been a representative of a block.\n\n\u201cThere were representatives for each block, so maybe the inmate you are referring to was one of such representatives, but it was not an individual event, it was a collective one commemorating International Women\u2019s Day,\u201d Oladokun added.",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Abuja, Ogochukwu Anioke, Abakiliki and Robert Egbe\n\nEbonyi State Governor David Umahi came under fire yesterday for his tirade against Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe judge, on Tuesday, ruled that the governor and his deputy, Eric Igwe, be sacked for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nJustice Ekwo ordered 16 lawmakers in the House of Assembly, who defected from the PDP to the APC, to vacate their seats.\n\nFaulting the judgment, Umahi accused the judge of being a \u201chatchet man\u201d, who was \u201con a mission,\u201d and implied that the judgment was \u201cpurchased\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have petitioned him to NJC (National Judicial Council) and we will follow it up to ensure that this man is brought to justice,\u201d Umahi added.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) demanded an apology from the governor and a retraction of the \u201coffensive\u201d comments.\n\nIts president, Olumide Akpata, described the governor\u2019s comments attacking the judiciary as \u201cdisgraceful, undemocratic and completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNBA said it was utterly dismayed by the Umahi\u2019s \u201cunfortunate and totally unacceptable\u201d reaction to the judgment.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cUmahi\u2026threw caution to the wind and deployed very uncomplimentary adjectives and intemperate language in characterising both the judgment and Hon. Justice Ekwo, including but not limited to describing the judgment as \u2018jungle justice\u2019 and His Lordship as \u2018a hatchet man\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs if these were not enough, Engr. Umahi accused the court of \u2018murdering justice\u2019 and also arrogated to himself the judicial powers and magisterial authority to declare the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction as null and void while unashamedly declaring his intention to disregard the judgment in favour of another.\n\n\u201cTo put it plainly, this is impunity of the highest order and executive rascality taken too far.\u201d\n\nAkpata said the leadership of the NBA was inundated with calls from well-meaning Nigerians who were outraged by Umahi\u2019s utterances.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we condemn without equivocation, Engr. Umahi\u2019s unfortunate diatribe which, if it had emanated from an average litigant, would still have been regarded as shocking but coming from one who occupies the exalted office of a State Governor, is nothing short of a national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the judgment, one would have expected Engr. Umahi to sue for calm from his supporters and to assure them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the Judgment.\n\n\u201cFor H.E. Engr. Umahi to instead resort to attacking and denigrating the high office of a judge in this unprecedented manner is disgraceful, undemocratic and completely unacceptable\u2026\n\n\u201cWe view Engr. Umahi\u2019s reaction to this judgment as being consistent with the current penchant, on the part of those in the executive arm of government, for intimidating the Judiciary whilst taking advantage of the historical reluctance of that arm of government to rise to its own defence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the foregoing, the NBA hereby demands an immediate apology from H.E. Engr. Dave Umahi and a retraction of the comments he made against the person and judgment of the Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cIt is also our demand that this apology and retraction be given as much media coverage as the press conference where the unfortunate comments were made.\u201d\n\nUmahi: PDP misled judge\n\nSpeaking in Abakaliki, the state capital while addressing a crowd of residents who embarked on a solidarity walk for him, the governor said the PDP misled the judge.\n\nHe urged them to be calm and law-abiding as he was confident of securing victory at the appeal court.\n\nHe said the judge was misled by PDP lawyers and that he had confidence in the judiciary.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cI want to thank Nigerians; I want to thank Ebonyi people. I was doing my projects inspection when the Deputy Governor called to inform me that Ebonyi people are here.\n\n\u201cI am just here to urge you to be very peaceful and to assure you that we still have very serious confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe NBA chairman published something and that I said the judge is biased but when we spoke this afternoon (yesterday), we understood ourselves.\n\n\u201cI say that the lawyers of PDP were the people that did the hatchet job. I am going to write to NBA to discipline them. The judge was misled.\n\n\u201cIn the Bayelsa case, there was a defect in the deputy governor\u2019s credentials but the Supreme Court said the votes cast belonged to the individuals, not the party.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers knew about this, they misled the judge. So the blame is not on the judge; the blame is to the PDP lawyers.\n\n\u201cI am using this opportunity to let Nigerians know that nobody castigated the judge and we will not.\n\nGovernor, others file appeal\n\nUmahi, Igwe and 16 members of the state House of Assembly have appealed the judgment.\n\nIn two notices of appeal filed by their lawyer, Chukwuma Machukwu Umeh (SAN), Umahi, Igwe and others are praying the Court of Appeal to set aside Justice Ekwo\u2019s judgement.\n\nIn the notice of appeal filed for Umahi and Igwe, 11 grounds of appeal were raised, while five grounds were raised in the notice of appeal filed for the 16 lawmakers.\n\nThe appellants argued that the trial court erred in law when it held that the provision of Section 308 of the Constitution was not applicable to the case.\n\n\u201cThe Hon trial court was virtually setting aside the Supreme court of Nigeria\u2019s decision in AG Federation v. Atiku Abubakar & 3 ORS (2007) LCN/3799(SC) to the effect that there are no constitutional provisions prohibiting President or vice and invariably the Governor and or deputy Governor from defecting to another political party,\u201d they said.\n\nThey also contended that the trial court erred in law and misdirected itself when it relied on Sections 68 and 109 of the Constitution to hold that the appellants, having defected from the PDP to the APC, offended the provisions of the Constitution and must vacate their offices as governor and deputy governor respectively.\n\n\u201cThere is no specific mention of governor and deputy governor in the provisions of sections 68 and 109 respectively of the 1999 Constitution (as amended)\n\n\u201cBy relying on sections 68 and 109 of the Constitution the trial court assumed the role of the legislator and arrogated to itself the powers of amendment of the Constitution\n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which state that governor or deputy governor will vacate his office if he defects from his political party to another political party,\u201d they said.\n\nThe appellants added that the trial court erred in law and overruled the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria when it held that the ownership of votes cast during the governorship election of 2019 belongs to the first respondent (the PDP) and not the appellants.\n\n\u201cThe trial court relied on Amaechi v. INEC and Faleke v. INEC when same are no longer the law on the ownership of votes cast in an election,\u201d they said.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenate, yesterday, rejected an Executive Bill transmitted by President Muhammadu Buhari to amend the Electoral Act signed into law on February 25.\n\nThis followed the failure of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to scale through second reading on the floor during plenary.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nA move to reject the bill was signalled by a call from Adamu Aliero for the Electoral Act amendment bill to be stepped down after the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved a motion for it to be read a second time. Aliero, who came under a Point of Order, drew the attention of his colleagues to the provision of Rule 52(5) of the Senate Standing Order.\n\nOrder 52(5) provides that: \u201cReference shall not be made to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending, in such a way as might in the opinion of the president of the Senate prejudice the interest of parties thereto.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, advised the upper chamber to step down the consideration of the bill pending the vacation of a court order delivered by the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday.\n\nHe said going ahead with the amendment of the Act was in clear conflict with the sub-judice rule in law which prevents the legislature from deliberating or considering any matter already before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cWe should not be seen to be disobeying the court order. No matter how bad that court order is, we should respect it,\u201d Aliero said.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe court, in a ruling delivered by Inyang Ekwo, on an ex parte application by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), barred President Muhammadu Buhari, the Attorney General of the Federation and Senate president from tampering with the newly amended Electoral Act 2022. The court maintained that the Electoral Act, having become a valid law could not be altered without following the due process of law.\n\nThe Senate president, while ruling on Aliero\u2019s Point of Order, insisted that the move by the upper chamber to amend the Electoral Act was in line with exercising its constitutional duties amid following due process.\n\n\u201cI think we are not breaching any law, in fact, we are trying to promote democracy because to do otherwise may mean that one day someone will go to court and say the Senate of the National Assembly should not sit.\u201d\n\nThe Senate leader was then given the floor to lead the debate on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nContributing to the debate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, kicked against the deletion of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill as requested by President Buhari.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are certain things that we see which we think we don\u2019t even have to come here to debate. One of those things is the fact that in every democracy, all over the world, there are certain rules which we don\u2019t need to be told about. One of those rules is the fact that you cannot be a referee and a player on the same field. It is either you\u2019re a referee or a player.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cSo, every other place in the world where democracy is practiced, including Nigeria, we don\u2019t need to be told that if we want to run for office, we have to resign. That is a sine qua non that we don\u2019t even need to debate.\n\n\u201cYet, in Nigeria, people think they can sit in an office and contest an election and become candidates and continue to sit in that office until the date of election. So, how would we continue to debase democracy in this way? Mr. President, I think, a cursory look at this paper shows that this paper is dead on arrival. And I urge you my colleagues, to help us to continue to deepen democracy by insisting this bill not be read a second time in any manner whatsoever.\u201d\n\nA move by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, to sway his colleagues was unsuccessful.\n\nThe bill, when eventually put to a voice vote for second reading by the Senate president after its consideration, received a resounding \u2018nay\u2019 from senators in the majority across party lines.\n\nIn a related development, the Senate, yesterday, passed the Proceeds of Crime (Recovery and Management) Bill, 2022.\n\nThe passage of the bill followed the consideration of a report by the Joint Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes; and Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nPresenting the Joint Committee\u2019s report, Sena Suleiman Abdu Kwari, said the bill seeks to provide for the restraint, seizure, confiscation and forfeiture of properties derived from unlawful activities.\n\nHe explained that if signed into law, it would expand the mandates of existing statutory institutions to manage proceeds of crime, rather than creating a new body to carry out such function.\n\nKwari said the bill\u2019s passage would also facilitate the establishment of departments in relevant organisations to manage forfeited assets as well as provide for effective legal framework for the recovery of proceeds of crime.\n\nThe lawmaker, explained further that the bill would strengthen the criminal confiscation procedure by ensuring that the total benefit from a person\u2019s criminal activity is recovered.\n\nAccording to him, it would \u201cgalvanise the collaborative efforts of relevant government agencies in the implementation of confiscation proceedings against convicted persons in tracing and forfeiture of properties reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activity through non-conviction based forfeiture proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe bill after consideration by the Committee of the Whole was passed by the upper chamber.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThis is coming 48 hours after the acting Deputy National chairman and Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, took over the secretariat of the APC along with some members of the CECPC.\n\nCompetent sources told Daily Sun that members of the CECPC were fully in support of Governor Bello running the APC till March 26 when the national convention would hold. It was gathered that the CECPC members have also approved that the acting Women Leader, Stella Okotete, takes over from Udoedehe as acting secretary pending the national convention.\n\nThis is as indication emerged that the Bello-led committee has sealed the possibility of Buni and Udoedehe returning to assume their positions by excluding them from the recently released Central Planning Committee for the March 26 national convention list.\n\nTo confirm slamming the doors on the duo, their names were conspicuously missing in the list of convention sub-committees, especially the Central Planning Committee.\n\nThe 11-member committee comprised all the Caretaker Committee members consisting of Governor Bello, Sen Ken Nnamani, Sen. Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, Akinyemi Olaide Jagaba, Sen. Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ms. Okotete, Dr. James Lalu, David Lyon, and Ismaeel Ahmed, without Governor Buni and the secretary, Akpanudoedehe.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

I want to remind you that you have to work hard to ensure that the national convention will hold on March 26, 2022. That day is sacrosanct insha Allah.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in a statement signed by the party\u2019s Director Publicity, Salisu Na\u2019inna Dambatta, the party also ratified the South West to produce the National Secretary while the National Publicity Secretary is zoned to the South-south.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

Since he was not around to defend the baseless allegations against him, they claimed that Buhari has endorsed him removal. But they got it all wrong because it has no constitutional backing.\u201d\n\nDismissing their actions and activities carried out so far by the Governor Bello-led CECPC without the endorsement of the secretary as a nullity, the source claimed that the current leadership lacked the recognition of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).",

I\u2019m sure other opportunities will come in future. I want to remind you that you have to work hard to ensure that the national convention will go on, on 26th of March 2022. That day is sacrosanct, insha Allah.\u201d\n\nHe posited that, the task before the committees was to ensure the success of the convention.\n\nUnfortunately, ahead of yesterday\u2019s developments, the party had mulled the options of offering Buni and Akpanudoedehe a soft-landing such that what was going on in the party would not seem as if they were disgraced out of office, after engaging them to set the party on the path of progress.\n\nTHISDAY sources said since the idea was mooted and shared with Buni especially, he had acted as if the new development in the party was not going to stand, deliberately foot-dragging, and therefore forced other stakeholders to conclude that the party must move forward regardless.\n\nThe party source hinted that despite all the changes that were going on in the party, Buni still stayed back in Dubai, where he was alleged to be observing medical vacation, thus prompting the new developments regardless, even though an express sack of the two would have been announced, the source added.\n\nSome of the excited members of the party have also rejoiced at some of the happenings in the party, saying it was surprising that some of the things Buni made to appear impossible had been addressed in four days, pointing out four critical decisions.\n\nAccording to the stakeholder, who pleaded anonymity, \u201cIn four days, Bello has sworn in all the state chairmen of the parties of the party. That\u2019s one. Two, he has received the zoning report from the committee. Three, he has summoned the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, which is now slated for next Thursday, and four, he has just sworn in the national convention sub-committees of the party.\n\n\u201cWhat more can you say? There\u2019s clearly nothing esoteric in leadership for as long as there is capacity and competence, and that\u2019s all Bello has exhibited in just four days of taking over the party leadership and doing the simple things that almost threw the party into the abyss.\u201d\n\nBut, in a development that might have justified all the steps so far taken in the APC, the party leadership has just discovered how a court order was secretly obtained in November last year by a certain Salisu Umoru, which Buni was privy to and kept till the last minute, to stop the party from going ahead with the convention.\n\nJustice Bello Kawu of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) had in an exparte application delivered on November 18, 2021, restrained the APC and Buni \u201cfrom organising, holding or conducting the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in January and February 2022 or any other date before or after pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nThe suit marked FCT/MC/CV2958/2021 was brought by Umoru, and had as respondents, the APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nTracing some of the events that led to the emergence of Bello to the failure of Buni to effect the directive of President Buhari on March 1, 2022, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, said the president, having accepted the zoning formula, directed the immediate swearing-in of state chairmen, who were elected some months back in order to put machinery in place for the convention, but sadly the directives were ignored.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe president gave three directives. He said this is the zoning formula that is fairest to everyone, I will sit with all the aspirants from North Central and will try to get to agree to consensus around one candidate, when I come back from my trip. Thirdly, he said they should swear in the states chairmen; they were elected months ago and they have not been sworn in, and because they have not been sworn in, the states executive cannot function, they should be sworn in so that a date can be fixed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the president added that they should give notice for an emergency national executive meeting, which he said required one week notice.\n\nHe noted that although Buni was not present in that meeting as he was said to be away on a medical trip, Bello who was a member of the caretaker committee, was mandated to pass the message to the caretaker committee to effect this action.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, said for days, no action was taken, saying, \u201cBuni travelled abroad on medical treatment and handed over to Bello as acting chairman while he was away. Bello now said let\u2019s implement the president\u2019s directives and the National Secretary just refused.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna governor said, following the refusal, the governors gathered on Sunday before the president left for his trip abroad to complain that, \u201cThere is no movement on this thing and we are hearing that there was a court order and we now saw that there was one.\u201d\n\nBut in spite of grandstanding and holding some face-saving media briefing on Tuesday, Akpanudoedehe failed to come to the party secretariat yesterday.\n\nIt was gathered that the security agents at the party secretariat were given clear orders not to allow Akpanudoedehe access to the secretariat.\n\nA party source, who preferred anonymity, said it was because of Akpanudoedehe that the security at the national secretariat was beefed up.\n\n\u201cIt was because of him that the security was beefed up. He has been asked to step aside and not to come close to the secretariat. We are in here for a serious matter now. We are preparing for the convention. March 26 is now sacrosanct. Before, when the Caretaker committee sits, you won\u2019t know what they discuss in the meeting. They will just come and eat and go,\u201d the source said.\n\nAlso, encouraged by the developments in the party, Okorocha, who spoke to journalists yesterday at the party secretariat, said with the new leadership in place, the March 26 convention was possibility.\n\n\u201cI can see light now at the dark end of the tunnel and I\u2019m more reassured more than ever that this convention will take place and it would be free and fair, given the leadership in place and given the stand of Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWhat simply needs to be done is to give every member of this party a sense of belonging, not forgetting the founding fathers and the parties that came together to form the APC.\n\n\u201cOne, which is the Congress of Progressives Change (CPC) led by President Muhammadu Buhari; the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) led by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) led by Rochas Okorocha; the All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP) led by Ogbonnaya Onu and Abdulaziz Yari and a host of others,\u201d he said.\n\nThe party chieftain noted that if these people were carried along and the governors were recognised as leaders of the party, the party would have a peaceful convention.\n\nHe stressed that the party should, as a matter of urgency, respect the rule of law and obey the court judgment and orders, where they exist, adding that when this is done, it would also give everyone a sense of belonging.\n\nThe former Imo governor said he came to the party secretariat to encourage the new leadership, give his word of advice and what should be done to move the party forward.\n\nAccording to him, APC remained the people\u2019s confidence, because the people believed in this party and \u201cif we hold this convention on the 26, it will restore the confidence of the people and members of this party\u201d.\n\nTo that extent, the governing APC leadership has approved the zoning of party offices, ahead of the convention.\n\nThis was contained in a statement, yesterday, by its Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu \u018aambatta.\n\n\u201cDuring its regular meeting on March 8, 2022, the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) approved the recommendations of the Committee on Zoning,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nThe positions zoned to the North-Central are: National Chairman, National Vice Chairman, Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nPositions zoned to the South-south are: National Vice Chairman, National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) a d National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nFor the South-west, the positions zoned to it are the National Secretary, National Vice Chairman, National Youth Leader, National Physically Challenged Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nThe South-east positions are Deputy National Chairman (South), National Vice Chairman, National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nPositions zoned to the North-east are Deputy National Chairman (North), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (North East), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex \u2013 Officio member.\n\nThose coming to the North-west are National Vice Chairman (North West), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National, Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special Leader (Persons with Disabilities \u2013 PWD) and National Ex-Officio member, the post of National disabled leader is zoned to the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe party, however, said the zonal representatives of the CECPC would coordinate the process in each zone.\n\nMeanwhile, the CECPC has shifted its emergency NEC meeting from Tuesday to Thursday 17th March, 2022.\n\nThe notice of invitation for the meeting which would be held virtually was signed by nine out of the 12 members of the caretaker committee.\n\nThose that signed the notice were Bello, Senator Ken Nnamani \u2013 South East representative, Senator Abubakar Yusuf \u2013 Senate representative, Stella Okotete \u2013 Women leader and James Lalu \u2013 PWD representative.\n\nOthers were Chief David Lyon \u2013 South-South representative;

          "text": "\u2022 As lawmakers throw out Buhari\u2019s request to amend contentious clause 84 which abridges constitutional right of appointees to vote and be voted for\n\nSunday Aborisade\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time since the country returned to democracy in 1999, the Senate yesterday reneged on an agreement it reached with a sitting president as the lawmakers overwhelmingly threw out a bill seeking to amend the new Electoral Act 2022.\n\nAccording to analysts, that was the first time the National Assembly would reach an agreement with a sitting president and go against it.\n\nThe Executive request was made by President Muhammadu Buhari to amend the Electoral Act signed into law on February, 25 2022.\n\nBuhari had requested that the National Assembly should delete Section 84 (12) which mandates government appointees to resign their positions three months ahead of primary elections of political parties in the newly signed Electoral Act 2022\n\nOwing to the development on the Red Chamber yesterday, pundits argued that there might be distrust between the executive and the National Assembly going forward, adding that it could negatively impact future bills.\n\nThe analysts pointed out that right from the tenure of former presidents: Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan \u2013 when the president wants to get a bill signed, they would agree with the National Assembly on areas they want removed or included and it would be done as agreed by both arms of government.\n\nTherefore, they noted that for the Senate not to abide with what was agreed with the executive would endanger future bills because the president would not listen to them again.\n\n\u201cBy their act, they have broken a sacrosanct tradition that is done everywhere in the world that practices democracy. This would have major impact on future bills and with future presidents,\u201d a source who pleaded to remain anonymous said.\n\nAnother source explained further; \u201cThe President had wanted to veto the reworked electoral act but was sensitive about the mood of the nation and the impact another delay would have on the 2023 elections calendar. Instead he raised the issue of the contentious clause with the leadership of the National Assembly who went to meet their caucus to discuss the President\u2019s concerns. They came back to the president that they have agreed to expunged the contentious clause that infringes on the constitutional rights of political appointees to vote or be voted for from the bill after he signed the bill into law. Having extracted that commitment from the leadership of the National Assembly, the President proceeded to sign the bill into law. And immediately followed with a request for an amendment based on the understanding reached with the lawmakers. It is therefore a betrayal of the understanding for the lawmakers to now turn round to reject the request from the President to amend the law to bring it in conformity with the constitution.\u201d\n\nReacting to the request by the president that Section 84 (12) be deleted in the new Electoral Act 2022, the source argued that, the section of the law was discriminatory because it allows elected officials to perpetuate themselves.\n\n\u201cThat means they would have no challenge from appointed officers,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was unanimously rejected by the lawmakers when it came for second reading on the floor during plenary, amidst a mild drama.\n\nThere were strong indications before plenary that the senators would kick against the bill despite the position of the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan that the red chamber would go ahead to consider the bill notwithstanding a court order barring it from doing so.\n\nThe court had, in a ruling delivered by Inyang Ekwo, on an ex-parte application by the People\u2019s Democratic Party, barred the President Muhammadu Buhari, the Attorney General of the Federation and the Senate President from tampering with the newly amended Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe Court maintained that the Electoral Act, having become a valid law could not be altered without following the due process of law.\n\nThe move to reject the bill was signaled by a point of order from Senator Adamu Aliero for it to be stepped down after the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved a motion for the bill to be read a second time.\n\nAliero, who came under a point of Order, drew the attention of his colleagues to the provision of Rule 52(5) of the Senate Standing Order.\n\nThe Order 52(5) provides that, \u201cReference shall not be made to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending, in such a way as might in the opinion of the President of the Senate prejudice the interest of parties thereto.\u201d\n\nAliero, therefore, advised the upper chamber to step down further consideration of the bill pending the vacation of a court order delivered by the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday.\n\nThe Senator maintained that going ahead with the amendment of the Act would be clear conflict with the sub judice rule in law which prevents the legislature from deliberating or considering any matter already before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nAliero explained: \u201cGoing ahead to consider the bill obviously will mean that we are disrespecting that order, and this is an institution of the Senate \u2013 the symbol of Nigeria\u2019s Lawmaking body.\n\n\u201cWe should not be seen to be disobeying the court order. No matter how bad that court order is, we should respect it.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m of the opinion that we should stop considering this bill pending the time the court set aside that order, and I think I\u2019m speaking the opinion of my colleagues here.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, while ruling on Aliero\u2019s point of Order, insisted that the move by the upper chamber to amend the Electoral Act was in line with exercising its Constitutional duties amid following due process.\n\nLawan said: \u201cTo be specific to this particular request, for us in the Senate, it is to look at the request and follow our due process.\n\n\u201cLooking at the request does not mean granting the request. Members of the National Assembly are at liberty to review the request to see if the arguments by the Executive arm of government are convincing enough.\n\n\u201cIf the arguments are not convincing enough, the National Assembly can deny the request, and that is how it is. We have no encumbrance from that order.\n\n\u201cSo, it is for Senators here to decide to vote for this amendment or vote against it.\n\n\u201cI think we are not breaching any law, in fact, we are trying to promote democracy because to do otherwise may mean that one day someone will go to court and say that the Senate of the National Assembly should not sit.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to all of us, that we are on the right course and my ruling remains that we are going ahead to consider the proposal which the Leader of the Senate is leading the debate.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the debate, we are going to vote, and the vote will decide the fate of the bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure all of us know that whatever we do here is to protect democracy and the sanctity of the upper chamber,\u201d the Senate President said.\n\nThe Senate Leader, was then given the floor to lead the debate on the Electoral Act Amendment bill.\n\nThe real drama started unfolding when the Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe (Abia South), kicked against the deletion of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill as requested by President Buhari.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are certain things that we see which we think we don\u2019t even have to come here to debate.\n\n\u201cOne of those things is the fact that in every democracy, all over the world, there are certain rules which we don\u2019t need to be told about.\n\n\u201cOne of those rules is the fact that you cannot be a referee and a player on the same field. It is either you\u2019re a referee or a player.\n\n\u201cSo, every other place in the world where democracy is practiced including Nigeria, we don\u2019t need to be told that if we want to run for office, we have to resign. That is a sine qua non that we don\u2019t even need to debate.\n\n\u201cYet here we are today in Nigeria, and people think they can sit in an office and contest an election and become candidates and continue to sit in that office until the date of election. So, how would we continue to debase democracy in this way?\n\n\u201cMr. President, I think, a cursory look at this paper shows that this paper is dead on arrival. And I urge you, my colleagues, to help us to continue to deepen democracy by insisting that this bill not be read a second time in any manner whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe rejection of the bill continued with the bombshell from the APC Senator, representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, who also, vehemently, expressed his disapproval to the consideration of the bill.\n\nAdeyemi said, \u201cone of the hallmarks of democracy is justice, fairness and equity.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIndeed, Mr. President, it is a settled matter in law that you cannot be a judge over you own case.\n\n\u201cIn any election, where people have the added advantage of holding executive power, either by proxy or directly or by appointment, for such people to have access and compete with others who came from the street, I think is an unjust society.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Mr. President, I disagree with all the arguments on the need to consider a decision that has already been settled.\u201d\n\nA last minute move by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, to save the bill from sudden death by swaying his colleagues\u2019 standpoint, also suffered a devastating blow.\n\nOmo-Agege said, \u201cThe framers of the constitution, knew that a day like this will come. And notwithstanding, it clearly stipulated in the constitution those provisions with qualification and disqualification on running for political office.\n\n\u201cIf it was their intent that for holding a political office, you should not contest election, they would have so provided.\n\n\u201cThere were some provisions some of us voted for at the beginning of section 84(2) that says no political party shall seek to disqualify anybody by importing into the process a provision for qualification or disqualification not otherwise provided for in the constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill was eventually put to a voice vote for second reading by the Senate President after its consideration, it received a resounding \u2018nay\u2019 from senators in the majority across party lines.\n\nThe Senate President made a futile attempt to save the bill when he put the question for a voice vote the second time and the senators maintained a resounding \u2018nay\u2019 again, leaving the presiding officer no other option than to hit the gavel in favour of the anti-bill lawmakers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Governor engages 18 senior advocates\n\n\u2022NBA condemns Umahi\u2019s attack on judge, demands apology\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to reverse a ruling by the Federal High Court, Abuja, which ordered their removal from office, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, yesterday engaged 18 Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN) to represent them in an appeal against the judgement. Umahi disclosed this during a solidarity rally held in Abakaliki, the state capital, by supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nBut the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it was awaiting the certified true copy of the court judgement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), yesterday, rose with indignation against Umahi for making unpleasant comments about a judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nUmahi said he had confidence in the judiciary, but he accused the legal team of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of misleading the judge of the Federal High Court, who ordered his removal from office.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI want to thank Nigerians; I want to thank Ebonyi people. I am just here for two things: one is to urge you all to be very peaceful, another is to tell you that we still have very serious confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe PDP lawyers were the people that did the hatchet job; the PDP were the people that were doing forum shopping and I am going to write the NBA to discipline them because you know, the judge was misled.\n\n\u201cIn Bayelsa governorship election, APC won the election but because there was defect in the credentials of the deputy, the Supreme Court, in their wisdom, saw that the votes cast in any election belongs to the candidates and not the party but lawyers knew about this but they misled the judge.\n\n\u201cI am using the opportunity to let Nigerians know that nobody castigated the judge and we will not do such.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have done three things: we have done the appeal at Enugu and when I said that we have two judgements, I said that the judgement in Ebonyi State, which has equal powers with that of Abuja, will be obeyed.\n\n\u201cWe will appeal the judgement of Abuja High court; we did not say we will disobey the court, otherwise, we will not appeal the judgement.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of South East Governors\u2019 Forum said the appeal was already before the appeal court in Enugu. \u201cWe are also before the appeal court in Abuja and we have also filed stay of execution,\u201d he added.\n\nUmahi noted that with the appeal already filled, he still remained the governor while Igwe remained the deputy governor of the state.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I made it very clear that the Supreme Court has said that for any defection in the legislative houses, the presiding officer, who is the Speaker or the Senate President, has the duty and not the court to declare the seat vacant,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated further that the House of Assembly had also appealed against the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, adding that the Assembly is still intact.\n\nUmahi told the people, \u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of, go about your businesses very peacefully and let me assure the NBA chairman that he is a perfect gentleman and that we will never insult the judiciary.\n\n\u201cWe have confidence in the judiciary and I know they will do the right thing and we have engaged eight SANs to proceed to Abuja, we have also engaged 10 SANs to proceed to Enugu. Do not be angry about anything, it is for our promotion.\n\n\u201cWhat the people intended for evil, God has turned it for good. When it happened yesterday, God told me be still and know that I am God. And so, you will see what God is going to do, Nigerians are fighting for us.\u201d\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had on Tuesday ordered Umahi, his deputy, and 16 state lawmakers to vacate their offices on account of their defection from PDP to APC. Ekwo held that their continued stay in office after defecting was illegal, null and void because the votes, which brought them into office, belonged to PDP that they had dumped for APC.\n\nHowever, in the notice of appeal filed by their lead lawyer, Chukwuma Machukwu-Ume, Umahi and Igwe asked the court to allow their appeal and set aside the judgment of the trial court that ordered their sack.\n\nThe appellants predicated the appeal on 11 grounds on which they argued that the trial court erred in law in arriving at the decision to remove them from office.\n\nIn ground one of the appeal, the appellants contended that the lower court erred in law and misdirected itself when it held that they \u201chave not seen any authority which propounds that where a governor or deputy governor defects, his political party on which platform he was elected into office, he cannot be sued by that political party to reclaim its mandate\u2026Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution did not envisage such a situation.\u201d\n\nThe appellants submitted that the trial court was virtually setting aside the Supreme Court of Nigeria\u2019s decision in \u201cAG Federation v. Atiku Abubakar & 3 ORS (2007) LCN/3799(SC) to the effect that there is no constitutional provisions prohibiting the president or vice and invariably the governor and or deputy governor from defecting to another political party or meting out punishment for doing same.\n\n\u201cThe trial court was also virtually setting aside the decision of the Supreme Court in Global Excellence Communications Ltd v. Duke (2007) LPELR \u2014 1323 to the effect that state governors and their deputies have immunity against being sued while in office.\u201d\n\nUmahi and Igwe argued that the provisions of Section 308 were specific, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the constitution, but subject to Subsection (2) of the section that \u201cno civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted or continued against 3th and 4th appellants during their mandate in office as governor and deputy governor respectively.\u201d\n\nMore so, the appellants maintained, \u201cThere is no provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) that provides for the removal of the appellants as sitting governor and deputy governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State for reason of defection.\u201d\n\nAmong other grounds, the appellants argued that the lower court erred in law when it assumed jurisdiction on the issue of defection of appellants, when it had no jurisdiction over it.\n\nThe error, according to Umahi and Igwe, was that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of what amounted to the Federal High Court having the powers of State High Court under the constitution was wrong.\n\n\u201cPower of court and jurisdiction are not the same,\u201d the appellants argued.\n\nThe appellants argued that they were state officers and not federal officers. They faulted Ekwo for relying on Sections 68 and 109 of the 1999 Constitution in holding that the appellants, having defected from PDP to APC, offended the provisions of the constitution and must vacate their offices as governor and deputy governor.\n\nThey further claimed that the trial court misdirected itself because, \u201cThere is no specific mention of governor and deputy governor in the provisions of Section 68 and 109, respectively, of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cBy relying on Sections 68 and 109 of the constitution, the trial court assumed the role of the legislator and arrogated to itself the powers of amendment of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which state that governor or deputy governor will vacate his office if he defects from his political party to another political party.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the 16 lawmakers of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly prayed the appellate court to set aside Ekwo\u2019s judgement of March 8, which also asked them to vacate their seats.\n\nThe affected lawmakers, in their notice of appeal dated March 9, also sought an order of the Court of Appeal setting aside the judgement of Ekwo.\n\nRespondents in the appeal are PDP, INEC, and APC.\n\nWe Are Waiting for Certified True Copy of Judgement, Says INEC\n\nINEC yesterday said it was yet to be served the certified true copy of the court ruling sacking Umahi and the others. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, disclosed this in an interview with newsmen in Abuja.\n\nOkoye said the commission would meet and take a decision when it receives the certified true copy of the court judgement.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe commission has not been served with a copy of the said judgement. The commission will meet and take a decision when it is served with a Certified True Copy of the judgement.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekalmi, said, \u201cAt the close of work yesterday, Tuesday 8th March, the commission had not received the Certified True Copy of the judgement of the Federal High Court on the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is only when this happens that the commission will meet and take a decision.\u201d\n\nIn reaction to the court judgement, PDP said it had submitted to INEC the names of Iduma Igariwey, a serving member of the House of Representatives, as nominee to replace Umahi, and Fred Udogwu as deputy governor to replace Igwe.\n\nPDP National Chairman, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu, said at a press conference in Abuja that the decision was made after due consultation with party stakeholders at the national and Ebonyi State chapter, in compliance with the Tuesday\u2019s judgement of the Federal High Court.\n\nNBA Condemns Umahi\u2019s Attack on Judge, Demands Apology\n\nNBA yesterday rose with indignation against Umahi for making unsavoury comments against a judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nIn his immediate reaction to the judgement, Umahi had in a press briefing attacked the person and judgement of Justice Ekwo, an action NBA said was not only unwarranted but a display of impunity.\n\nThe umbrella association of Nigerian lawyers said in a statement, \u201cThe NBA has noted with utter dismay, the unfortunate and totally unacceptable reaction of Engr. Dave Umahi to the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, delivered on March 8, 2022, by Justice Inyang Ekwo, which inter-alia ordered him and Mr. Eric Igwe to vacate the offices of governor and deputy governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State on grounds of their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cFollowing the judgement, Engr. Umahi, in the course of a press conference \u2013 video evidence of which is currently making the rounds on both new and mainstream media \u2013 threw caution to the wind and deployed very uncomplimentary adjectives and intemperate language in characterising both the judgment and Justice Ekwo, including but not limited to describing the judgment as jungle justice and His Lordship as a hatchet man.\n\n\u201cAs if these were not enough, Engr. Umahi accused the court of murdering justice and also arrogated to himself the judicial powers and magisterial authority to declare the judgement of a court of competent jurisdiction as null and void while unashamedly declaring his intention to disregard the judgement in favour of another.\n\n\u201cTo put it plainly, this is impunity of the highest order and executive rascality taken too far.\u201d\n\nPresident of NBA, Mr. Olumide Akpata, who signed the statement, noted that although NBA had absolutely no interest in the outcome of the case in question and would continue to stay away from partisan politics, it would not \u201csit idly by in the face of this unprovoked and totally unwarranted attack on the judiciary.\u201d\n\nAkpata disclosed that the leadership of NBA had been inundated with calls from a cross-section of well-meaning Nigerians who were outraged by the utterances of Umahi and who had rightly demanded that appropriate action be taken to protect the sanctity of the judiciary.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is for this reason that we condemn without equivocation, Engr. Umahi\u2019s unfortunate diatribe which, if it had emanated from an average litigant, would still have been regarded as shocking but coming from one who occupies the exalted office of a state governor, is nothing short of a national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the judgement, one would have expected Engr. Umahi to sue for calm from his supporters and to assure them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the judgement.\n\n\u201cFor Umahi to, instead, resort to attacking and denigrating the high office of a judge in this unprecedented manner is disgraceful, undemocratic, and completely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe view Engr. Umahi\u2019s reaction to this judgement as being consistent with the current penchant, on the part of those in the executive arm of government, for intimidating the judiciary whilst taking advantage of the historical reluctance of that arm of government to rise to its own defence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the forgoing, the NBA hereby demands an immediate apology from Dave Umahi and a retraction of the comments he made against the person and judgement of Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court. It is also our demand that this apology and retraction is given as much media coverage as the press conference where the unfortunate comments were made.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Residents of Damasak town in the Mobbar Local Government Area of Borno State are currently living in fear after the Brigade Commander for the 145 battalion withdrew troops from the area, a military source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\nSome military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Brig. Gen. G.O. Olorunyomi was dispatched to the area to replace S.S. Tilawan as the new Brigade Commander but noted it had affected the security of the area.\n\nFile Photo\n\nThe sources alleged that G.O. Olorunyomi was only after his convenience having withdrawn troops and other weapons from Damasak to Gubio which was termed \u2018Tactical Headquarters\u2019.\n\n\n\nOne of the sources said the new Brigade Commander, from all indications, does not want to stay in the bush (Damasak) and would rather serve himself than the people, who are now in danger.\n\n\n\nThe source told SaharaReporters, \u201cThere is serious tension in Damasak as the new brigade commander, Brig. Gen. G.O. Olorunyomi, withdrew troops from Damasak to Gubio.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe has taken lots of soldiers from here, the area is empty and civilians are seriously troubled that Boko Haram may attack at any time due to the number of soldiers that left Damasak.\n\n\n\n\u201cOlorunyomi literally left with all the equipment that the former Brigade Commander built such as the medical facility. When the former Brigade Commander came, he found out that soldiers were dying due to a lack of medication.\n\n\u201cAfter an attack, if a soldier sustains a little injury, the soldier is likely to die before they call in Force medical team to come and evacuate the person to Maiduguri or maybe on the way, there might be an ambush.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe man built a huge hospital for soldiers here in Damasak, that's Brigadier General S.S. Tilawan but this new Brigade Commander took everything and took all soldiers to Gubio. Even civilians are trembling.\"\n\nAnother source noted that the former brigade commander gave soldiers hope but that, unlike his predecessor, Olorunyomi likes convenience and \"doesn't want to stay in the bush\".\n\n\u201cThe former brigade commander did a very good job, he gave soldiers hope, made us live a comfortable life but this new one doesn't want to stay in the bush. Since he came here, he has visited Maiduguri more than 15 times while the former one only left this bush once when his father died.\n\n\u201cHe showed an example of leadership but it's unfortunate that in the Nigerian Army, some commanders come to deliver, some come to scatter.\n\n\n\n\u201cOlorunyomi came and took the weapons that Tilawan fought to get for this area and took them away, this area is very close to Lake Chad, and enemies can attack at any time. It is the last point of entry into the Niger Republic but the new BG doesn't care, he took everything to go and grind himself in Gubio.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis new brigade commander banned Civilian JTF whereas Tilawan used to pay these boys every month so security could be very tight but this man came and banned everything, making these men a threat to the Nigerian Army because they are not happy.\n\n\u201cThat's what is going on here, there is fear in the mind of civilians and soldiers are not happy with all that this new brigade commander did.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe packed both elements of 145 battalion and 5 Brigade both humans and weapons from Damasak to Gubio, took them there and called the place tactical headquarters because he doesn't want to stay in the bush.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the new chief of staff for 5 brigade, Colonel B.C. Ezah was busy looking for money. Tilawan created a place to provide water for civilians in the town but this new Chief of Staff came and stopped it,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nEfforts made by SaharaReporters to reach the Nigerian Army Director of Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, were not successful as he did not answer calls or reply to a text message sent to him.",

          "text": "The General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International, Dr. Daniel Olukoya, has asked the family of a Regional Pastor, Dan Osato Osamwonyi, abducted 10 months ago to keep praying instead of wasting money on the case.\n\nThe family alleged that the MFM GO had ignored the family, stressing that up till the moment, no single word or trace of pastor Daniel Osamwonyi had been seen and no call placed for a ransom.\n\nPastor Daniel Olukoya, General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM).\n\nSaharaReporters had on Monday reported that Pastor Dan Osato Osamwonyi, the Regional Overseer Mountain Of Fire And Miracles Ministries (MFM), Midwest Region 66, Benin City, who was abducted on May 25, 2021, is still missing 10 months after, giving the family a lot of concern.\n\nOsamwonyi was abducted on May 25, 2021, on his way to attend to a private issue. He was intercepted by some gunmen, who whisked him away from his Nissan SUV, into a getaway car and he has since remained incommunicado.\n\nThe Edo State Police Command that claimed to be on the trail of the abducted cleric, has not made any headway either, though, a suspect believed to be connected to the crime was arrested.\n\nHowever, a family member told SaharaReporters that the GO was informed about the incident but he called only once.\n\nSaharaReporters also obtained the audio of the conversation between Olukoya and the family on the incident.\n\nThe source affirmed that Olukoya asked them to go to God in prayers instead of wasting money during the only conversation that the family was able to have with him.\n\nThe family hinted that the suspect, one \u201cRobert Ukpong\u201d is also a member of MFM. They queried whether the G.O had bothered to have a one-on-one conversation with him to know why his name appeared on the text message from Pastor Daniel the day he (Daniel) was kidnapped.\n\nThe source said, \u201cDr D.K Olukoya was duly informed about the incident but he only called once. Calling him; he never picks up; as for texts and emails, he never responds. What was expected of the G.O was to be actively involved and go to any lengths to make sure his Regional Overseer pastor was found. But so far, no sign of that; the only time the family was able to reach the G.O on phone and even begged him to use his influence; he said, \u201cInstead of wasting money, the best is to go to God in prayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is really sad and painful because pastor Daniel Osamwonyi has done nothing but served MFM selflessly for the past 22 years, built churches in Expoma, Abuja and Benin and also bought a Prayer City for MFM in Benin City. Despite all the hate that has been thrown at him (I don\u2019t even want to go into the tribalism and nepotism) he continues to serve because he actually loves God and enjoys working wholeheartedly for him.\u201d\n\n\"The police and DSS keep lying that they can\u2019t track or trace pastor Daniel Osamwonyi\u2019s phone even after four months of his kidnap; but the children and some of the family members got a WhatsApp notification that Pastor Daniel left their WhatsApp group chat, but then DSS and police kept saying they can\u2019t track his phone because there\u2019s no network as the phone was turned off.\n\n\"The suspect \u2018Robert Ukpong\u2019 is also a member of MFM, has the G.O bothered having a one on one conversation with him to know why his name appeared on the text message from Pastor Daniel the day he was kidnapped?\n\n\"This is why we the family are crying out loud for the public to help us ask MFM to rise for Pastor Daniel Osamwonyi, the MFM Regional Overseer,\" the source added.",

          "text": "David Umahi probably didn\u2019t see it coming. Almost three years into his second term as Ebonyi governor and currently nursing a presidential ambition, the tide has turned and he is currently in a legal battle to retain his governorship seat.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal high court in Abuja sacked the Ebonyi governor, Eric Igwe, his deputy, and 16 other lawmakers for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) under which they contested the election.\n\nInyang Ekwo, the judge, ruled that the votes belong to the party and not the candidates.\n\n\u201cA party cannot win an election by poaching the candidates of the party that actually won an election. In the same vein, a person who won an election on the platform of a political party and occupied an office by virtue of that, cannot by an act of defection make a party that lost an election become the party in power,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEkwo said although section 68(1)(g) and section 109(g) of the constitution expressly made reference to lawmakers who deferred, it does not mean that other persons who occupy elected positions should go free.\n\nThe judge also dismissed the argument that the governor and deputy governor enjoy immunity as provided in section 308 of the constitution, adding that the provision does not apply in the current situation.\n\nSIMILAR SUIT THROWN OUT\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February 2022, a suit filed before the federal high court in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi capital, seeking Umahi\u2019s removal on the grounds of his defection from PDP was dismissed. The suit was filed by Sunny Ogbuorji, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 election.\n\nHenry Njoku, the judge, said having regard to section 188 (1) of the 1999 constitution as amended, the defendant (Umahi) has not offended any provision of the constitution or the electoral act in his defection to APC.\n\nThe court further held that having regard to section 308 of the constitution, it is wrong to institute criminal or civil proceedings against the office of the governor. The court therefore dismissed the case in its entirety.\n\nWILL PDP NEED TO CONDUCT NEW PRIMARY?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn ruling on Umahi\u2019s defection, Ekwo had ordered INEC to receive \u2014 from the PDP \u2014 names of persons to replace Umahi and his deputy, or in the alternative, conduct fresh gubernatorial election in Ebonyi state in line with section 177 (c) of the constitution.\n\nThe Electoral Act 2022 provides for a political party presenting candidates to adopt the direct, indirect or consensus methods \u2014 which will be confirmed at a convention held by the party.\n\nAs things stand, the PDP has submitted the names of Iduma Igariwey and Fred Udogwu as replacements for Umahi and Igwe. But neither Igariwey, a member of the house of representatives, nor Odogwu participated in the 2019 primary as required by section 141 of the electoral act.\n\nConsidering that Umahi was the sole governorship aspirant at the PDP primary in 2019, there remains the question on if the opposition party has the window to nominate governorship and deputy governorship candidates \u2014 if Umahi and Igwe lose their bid to remain in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE KOGI EXAMPLE\n\nIn the case of Faleke v INEC, the supreme court had dismissed the appeal which sought the removal of Yahaya Bello as Kogi governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Faleke, who was Audu Abubakar\u2019s running mate under the APC, had submitted that he was the next in line to fill the governorship seat following the latter\u2019s death.\n\nHowever, a seven-member panel of the apex court, on September 20, 2016, held that Faleke has no right to the seat because the election was inconclusive before Abubakar\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, supreme court justice, said Faleke neither obtained nomination form nor substantively participated in the APC governorship primary.\n\nAffirming the APC\u2019s decision to appoint Bello, the court held that the valid votes belong to the party and that the party was right to have nominated Bello who scored the second highest votes in the primary election.\n\n\u201cNothing can be more apt as the governor had fully participated in the governorship primary election of the APC and came second after Abubakar, unlike Faleke, who did not meet that condition, but was simply selected to be a deputy governor,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of the provisions of section 221 of the 1999 constitution, it is the political parties that actually contest elections. The governor, having become candidate of APC, and legally sponsored by the same party, can lay claim to the votes scored by the party in the November 21, 2015 poll.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018PDP CAN\u2019T REPLACE UMAHI SINCE HE WON 2019 PRIMARY UNOPPOSED\u2019\n\nAdeola Adedipe, a lawyer, said if the supreme court upholds the decision to remove Umahi and Igwe from office, PDP cannot nominate new candidates or conduct fresh primary according to the provisions of the electoral act.\n\n\u201cConsidering the facts available, the court didn\u2019t say they should carry out another primary. That window has passed. And since Umahi was the sole candidate of the PDP at the time, by law, it now falls back to the party that came second \u2014 in this case, the APC,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, by the same stretch, Umahi still can\u2019t retain that position even if he is now an APC member, since he wasn\u2019t an aspirant of that party in 2019.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Adedipe faulted the decision of the high court, adding that the issue of defection by a president or governor has already been settled by the supreme court in AG, Federation V Atiku Abubakar (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt.1041) 1, 29.\n\nAccording to him, the supreme court found that \u201cit is not illegal to defect, and the president has no power to declare the Atiku seat vacant and the court had no jurisdiction to entertain such an action\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat decision is extant. I am not aware of any other decision of the supreme court that has impeached the decision. By the doctrine of stare decisis, Ekwo is bound by it,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S A PROBLEMATIC JUDGMENT\u2019\n\nInibehe Effiong, another lawyer, described the court ruling as \u201cproblematic\u201d, adding that said the action of the PDP on nominating replacements.\n\n\u201cThe list submitted by PDP cannot be acted upon while the appeal and motion for stay is pending. But I don\u2019t even agree with the judgment of the federal high court to begin with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the judgment that PDP should nominate replacement, I don\u2019t believe that can be done constitutionally, because a political party cannot have a candidate not nominated within the timeline set by INEC. So, when we now have a case in which the party nominates candidates who didn\u2019t even participate in the primary or even obtained forms for INEC, there is no way that person can be accepted as governor.\n\n\u201cThe judgment is a bit problematic because PDP has the unfettered discretion to determine who to nominate to replace Umahi and his deputy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s doable legally. You can\u2019t conduct primary after election has been concluded.\u201d\n\n\u2018PROPER CONSULTATION WAS DONE\u2019\n\nWhen asked on what grounds Igariwey and Udogwu were selected, Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, said proper consultation was done.\n\n\u201cIn the PDP, we carry out consultation in everything that we do and that was what informed the nomination of names that were forwarded to INEC for the issuance of a certificate of return. What we have done is in compliance with the court order,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to the case of Faleke v INEC, Ologunagba said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lie in my mouth to interpret what the court has said in one case or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of the case you are mentioning is different from this. And so, it would not be accurate to begin to compare with our case,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lawyer with over two decades at the bar and I can tell you that what we have done as a party is to simply obey a court order. If anyone is dissatisfied with that, there are processes to be followed.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Emmanuel Ukala, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) who handled the PDP\u2019s case, said since the constitution is superior to any other law, section 141 of the electoral act would have to give way to section 221 of the constitution, which empowers a political party to produce a candidate.\n\nOn his part, Mike Ozekhome, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said \u201cthis judgment cannot survive appellate scrutiny\u201d, and citing the case of the AG, Federation v. Atiku Abubakar (2007), he added that a governor and his deputy \u201cought not to have been sued in the first place\u201d.\n\nWHO TAKES OVER IF UMAHI LOSES APPEAL?\n\nUmahi and Igwe, on Wednesday, filed an appeal seeking an order setting aside the judgement ordering their removal from office.\n\nAccording to section 191(2) of the constitution, in a situation where the seat of the governor and deputy governor becomes vacant by reason of death, resignation, impeachment, permanent incapacity or removal from office, the speaker of the state house of assembly shall hold the office for not more than three months.\n\nIn the current case, the speaker of Ebonyi state assembly and 15 other lawmakers were sacked by the court on Tuesday. Ebonyi has 24 state assembly members in total. However, if Umahi and Igwe lose their seats, the remaining members can appoint a new speaker who can take charge until a new governor is named.\n\nOTHER GOVERNORS THAT RISK SACK\n\nAlready, the PDP has instituted a suit against Ben Ayade, Cross River governor, over his defection to the APC. PDP is praying a federal high court in Abuja to sack Ayade and his deputy, Ivara Esu, following their defection from the PDP.\n\nBello Matawalle, Zamfara governor, is also facing a suit at a federal high court in Abuja seeking his sack over defection to the APC.\n\nAlthough a federal high court sitting in Gusau, Zamfara capital, struck out a suit filed by some members of the PDP against Matawalle, the suit at the Abuja court is yet to be determined.\n\nIn dismissing the suit marked FHC/GS/CS/14/2021, the court in Gusau had held that it was only an election tribunal or state house of assembly that can remove a governor from office.\n\nInterestingly, the suit at the Abuja federal high court marked FHC/ABJ/CS/650/2021 is before Ekwo, same judge who sacked Umahi.",
          "summary": "\u201cA party cannot win an election by poaching the candidates of the party that actually won an election.\nThe judge also dismissed the argument that the governor and deputy governor enjoy immunity as provided in section 308 of the constitution, adding that the provision does not apply in the current situation.\nThe suit was filed by Sunny Ogbuorji, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 election.\nIn the current case, the speaker of Ebonyi state assembly and 15 other lawmakers were sacked by the court on Tuesday.\nInterestingly, the suit at the Abuja federal high court marked FHC/ABJ/CS/650/2021 is before Ekwo, same judge who sacked Umahi.",

          "title": "How Helium Health assembled a star founding team",
          "text": "Finding co-founders and hiring employees in the early days of a startup is integral to its survival and growth. Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, navigated this challenge in its early days by putting together a team of first employees that got the job done.\n\nHelium Health was co-founded by Adegoke Olubisi, Dimeji Sofowora, and Tito Ovia in 2016 to use technology to provide better healthcare services for Africans. Today, it optimises medical records by storing them electronically; and provides a payment system and healthcare financing solution for clinics, and a telemedicine feature. In 2020, Helium Health raised $10 million in Series A funding to expand its offering across African countries. Last November, it expanded to the MENA region when it acquired a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform, Meddy.\n\nTo understand the role having a star team plays in a startup\u2019s early days, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Tito Ovia, co\u2013founder and current Head of Public Sector Growth at Helium Health, on the fifth episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2, by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nOvia was named a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient and a winner of the Future Africa Award for Disruption for her work on African healthcare through Helium Health. When Ovia is not fixing healthcare in Africa, she is occupied with the Feminist Coalition, a globally-acclaimed women\u2019s rights advocacy group promoting equality for women in the Nigerian society with a core focus on education, financial freedom, and representation in public office.\n\nFinding co-founders\n\nOvia\u2019s childhood dream was to provide healthcare services across Africa, but that dream did not materialise until she quit her job at the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency. Ovia, at the time, was trying to figure out what to do next in the healthcare space. She also wanted to leave the country. A friend of hers, who attended law school with her co-founder, Demiji, told her about a small group of people trying to build a tech and healthcare company, but none of the co-founders were in the healthcare space. The friend advised Ovia to have a talk with them because they needed directions and would need the help of someone like her.\n\nSo, Ovia met with Goke and Dimeji for the first time for a chat intended to last an hour but stretched to 7 hours. During the conversation, it was clear that they were all connected by a similar drive and interest. \u201cWe connected on a deeper level of wanting to be able to provide value and fix our country,\u201d Ovia said.\n\nConvincing your first set of customers\n\nOvia said that it was challenging to convince people, that they knew what they were doing. When they tried to get their first 10\u201315 customers, they were required to present other people that could vouch for them.\n\nOvia said that another challenge Helium Health faced in its early days was identifying the strength of each of its team members and only assigning related tasks to them. \u201cIf you are a small team of 5, everybody does everything. It was a scramble, and all hands were on deck to get things done.\u201d\n\nWhen Ovia was asked about how she managed conflict and managing relationships with her co-founders, she explained that she likes good conflict and doesn\u2019t see it as a horrible thing because it means that \u201cnobody is a sheep\u2014it means everybody is thinking and invested in the growth of the organisation\u201d. \u201d\n\nShe sees conflict as a pitch: \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince co-founders on a particular direction, how do you want to convince the outside world, your investors, and board?\u201d\n\nOvia also noted that she and her co-founders take management and leadership courses and have mediators who step in during their conflicts. She also revealed they have advisors and neutral parties who are invested in the growth of the company and provide their opinions on important issues.\n\nWhat makes good co-founders?\n\nOvia believes trust is one of the things that makes a good co-founder. \u201cI have to be able to close my eyes and believe that you are not going to throw me off a cliff.\u201d This should be coupled with openness, she noted.\n\nOvia believes it is important that co-founders be at the right place in their lives. \u201cWhat this means is that, if you decide to be a high growth startup, everybody must have the time and bandwidth to build it,\u201d she said. This is because she explained, personal responsibilities might stop some people from committing to such gruelling work. \u201cSometimes, you have a co-founder slacking because they have other priorities in their life.\u201d\n\nShe also believes co-founders must have similar values. \u201cEverybody has to be able to align on how and where they want to end up.\u201d Ovia doesn\u2019t believe there is an ideal number of co-founders but also does not believe in gathering people just for the sake of it.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe that every entrepreneur needs a co-founder. Although, she believes every founder needs a strong executive team: a chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief technical officer (CTO) \u201cThis is because, if anything goes wrong, the strong executive team that you\u2019ve built can do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThis is important, she explains because building in a startup\u2019s early days is a lonely process. \u201cThere are so many trials and tribulations that we\u2019ve gone through at Helium Health that I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019ve had co-founders to cry to when it feels like everything is over.\u201d\n\nOvia recalled that in Helium Health\u2019s early days, they couldn\u2019t even afford to schedule a meeting with the kind of talent that they have now. \u201cThen, it was just an idea, a couple of hospitals, and we were not sure if we would make it past the year.\u201d So, Helium Health had to forgo talent and opt for talent that were fresh out of the university and had a few years\u2019 of experience.\n\n\u201cWe targeted dreamers, people who are committed to the idea and who believe that someday the startup would be big. We sold the promise of a tomorrow to our early staff. Some people didn\u2019t buy it, some people did.\u201d\n\nBut as they grew, post-Series A, they needed people with more advanced skills\u2014chief product officer (CPO), head of HR, head of finance, and CFO\u2014so, they started selling good working conditions: early closing time, working from home, and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to their employees. \u201cBy doing that, we were able to attract the sort of amazing talent we have now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ovia didn\u2019t find looking for a technical co-founder difficult because Helium Health\u2019s CEO was a technical person, she advised them to get an executive or senior manager on board instead of a technical co-founder. \u201cWhen you see that there is a working relationship between you and the person, you can then bring them on board as a co-founder.\u201d She advised against rushing into a co-founder relationship because it is like a marriage.\n\nWatch the full conversation here:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why e-commerce is king in Egypt",
          "text": "When Syrian entrepreneur Ronaldo Mouchawar founded Souq.com in 2005, buying things by clicking a picture on a clunky computer was unheard of in the Middle East. Somehow, Souq managed to quickly become the leading online retailer in the Middle East. And in 2017, twelve years after it launched, Amazon bought it for $580 million to expand operations in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nToday Egyptian sales make up more than half of Souq\u2019s revenues.\n\nSouq\u2019s $580 million buyout underscored Amazon\u2019s online retail expectations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where e-commerce continues to grow at 25% every year. Bain and Company say the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Egypt, with its 103+ million residents, make up roughly 80% of the e-commerce market in the MENA region.\n\nFurthermore, a Disrupt Africa report released in January shows that 20% of Egyptian startups are decidedly pursuing opportunities in the e-commerce and retail-tech space. That is roughly two times the number of fintech startups operating in the country and a sharp contrast to the rest of the continent\u2019s startup profile. Last year, Egyptian e-commerce startups received USD$ 131.27 million; according to Africa: The Big Deal, which is 1.4 times the e-commerce funding Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa received in the same period.\n\nClearly, retail tech and e-commerce rule Egypt\u2019s tech scene; and this is why.\n\nGovernment policy is pushing informal SME retail online.\n\nFacing a budget deficit of $27.8 billion in May 2018, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered five-year tax exemptions while urging informal workers to legalise their status. The government had hoped to raise an additional $51.9 billion in taxes from the informal sector. At a parliamentary session, Mohamed Badrawi, a member of the Economic Affairs Committee, declared that \u201cIncorporating all these economic activities into the formal sector is becoming an urgent matter.\u201d\n\nThe informal sector in Egypt accounts for more than half of Egypt\u2019s economy. In 2020, the government issued a new law that offered incentives for small businesses to incorporate as formal entities. Beyond creating incentives for informal traders to formalise operations, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank imposed daily limits on cash deposits and withdrawals while asking banks to remove similar daily limits on digital transactions. The bank says this will help support financial inclusion goals. In reality, however, this push saw informal traders who generate bulk sales in cash struggle to deposit and withdraw cash, as a result, pushing them to formalise their businesses. When these traders incorporate and begin to accept digital transactions, it also makes sense to take their business online.\n\nA market scene in Cairo. Egypt\u2019s informal economy constitutes up to 50% of the country\u2019s GDP, provides more than 60% of new jobs and is growing by 1% every year.\n\nPhoto: Alex Azabache/Unsplash\n\nThe functioning belief on the part of the government was that e-commerce would aid a transition away from cash dependency, which will, in turn, reduce the size of the informal sector and increase tax revenue.\n\nCovid-related restrictions accelerated consumer trust in digital commerce channels.\n\nThe social and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation globally. Egypt was not an exception.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s best-strong-armed efforts (it mandated the use of cashless systems to pay for government services and imposed fines on defaulters), Egyptian shoppers remained reluctant to use digital channels for shopping or payments \u2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThis was also partly driven by the reforms mentioned earlier which the Egyptian government used to encourage informal retailers to formalise their operations. At the time, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank waived several bank transaction fees for 6 months which it later extended to the middle of 2021. As a result, despite predictions about slowing digital commerce growth in Egypt, Jumia and Noon reported a 940% increase in online sales as the pandemic hit. 72% of participants in a Mastercard survey claimed to have shopped online during the pandemic.\n\nThe trend appears to have sustained beyond COVID-19 as more people than ever use smartphones to access services. Today Egyptian e-commerce is expected to grow at least 30% this year, buoyed by younger shoppers and rising incomes from Egypt\u2019s expanding middle class.\n\nGood infrastructure is good business.\n\nAn omnibus whizzes past in Alexandria, Egypt. 74% of Egypt\u2019s 65,050km road network are paved more than double the continental average.\n\nPhoto: Fady Fouad/Unsplash\n\nAs e-commerce accelerated in Egypt, it created a ripple effect on the logistics sector. People who buy things online need to get their goods delivered somehow. While infrastructure in Egypt is not the best globally, Egyptian infrastructure is second only to that of the island nation of Seychelles on the Africa Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nA combination of a reasonably good road network and increased investment in transport and telecoms infrastructure is proving beneficial to the handful of logistics-tech startups that are helping to make shopping online easier.\n\nStill, as with online retail anywhere, last-mile logistics remains an issue. According to Waya Media, 40% of online orders in Egypt do not reach their customers the first time they are shipped. So while Egypt\u2019s 4000 post offices make up the backbone of its distribution network, a good number of online retailers who need to deliver items to their customers\u2019 doorsteps partner with full-service logistics companies or use smaller specialized delivery units that stitch together end-to-end services to patch delivery gaps.\n\nAggressive infrastructure investments by the Egyptian government has seen it rise to second place, only behind Seychelles on the African Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nSource: Open Data for Africa\n\nOther startups like Appetito are pioneering franchised pickup centres similar to what Getir does in Europe to bring grocery deliveries closer to their customers. More prominent players like Amazon opened a 28,000 square meter warehouse in the 10th of Ramadan City in August last year. The new hub and 15 delivery stations across Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Ismailia, and Assiut are part of Amazon\u2019s growing MENA distribution network.\n\nEgypt\u2019s last-mile delivery startups are the API connectors in a very fragmented supply chain. Image source: Wamda.\n\n\u201c[BNPL will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards\u201d \u2013 Sherif Nessim, Founding General Partner, Jedar Capital\n\nThe e-commerce boom is also creating ripple effects for fintech in Egypt. While cash-on-delivery is very much alive, the value of card transactions is growing at an impressive pace. The Egyptian central bank is playing a leading role in facilitating this shift. For example, it allows banks operating in the Egyptian market to own unlimited shares in payment service providers and payment systems operators as part of the country\u2019s push towards cashless payments.\n\nSherif Nessim, Founding General Partner at Jedar Capital, believes that Buy Now Pay Later offerings can help accelerate the transition to digital payments. \u201cEvery year, we find that the balance is moving from cash-on-delivery to cards, cash to cards. People are putting more trust in online payment methods,\u201d BNPL solutions, he adds, \u201c[will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards because if I pay with this credit card, I can pay in 6 months, interest-free.\u201d When you think about it, it makes sense for a market where younger and relatively more impulsive shoppers are the drivers of e-commerce growth.\n\nAccording to Nessim, all of these plays are part of why he expects growth to continue for traditional e-commerce and q-commerce companies.\n\nAttractive growth prospects lure VC money.\n\n2021 was a record-setting year for venture-backed companies globally. Venture capitalists invested more than USD$ 675 billion into startups globally, and Africa outdid its 2019 record with more than $5 billion invested in African startups. Venture funds were themselves swamped with cash, partly a fall out of fiscal (stimulus) policies for the pandemic and partly as a result of more people being willing to bet on risky \u201ccompanies of the future\u201d than ever before.\n\nAll of this activity has set the perfect stage for venture capital funds in Egypt. Last year and led by funding into e-commerce and retail tech companies, Egyptian startups raised $403.5 million, according to data from Disrupt Africa.\n\nWith more cash to spend, investor packs are hunting for growth and returns in emerging and frontier markets. Post-revolution Egypt happens to be one of the latest such frontier markets. Naturally, investors have their eyes on it. \u201cThey realise that the next ten years are the years for emerging and frontier markets,\u201d Sherif Nessim says. He adds that some VC firms he knows are creating dedicated funds \u201cthat only invest in emerging markets rather than invest out of their global funds.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, like Amazon and Souq illustrate, bigger growth-hungry companies in the United States and Europe prefer to acquire local companies in emerging markets instead of building from scratch.\n\nEgypt\u2019s unique combination of growing venture capital interest, growth prospects, and a government determined to shore up revenues by including more informal businesses means digital commerce will continue to grow as more retailers become formal and come online. At the same time, it also signals significant growth prospects for affordable business-to-business software and services to help these newly formal businesses manage their processes and access credit.\n\nCritics have slammed MENA investors for mostly backing e-commerce and marketplace startups. However, by helping buying and selling thrive online, those investments may be responsible for accelerating digital adoption in other areas in a region as conservative as the MENA. After all, since commerce is the backbone of the world\u2019s economic systems, it only makes sense for the digital version of the bazaars and souks that line Egyptian streets to lead the way for her technology ecosystem.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "As with most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, access to basic financial services is significantly limited in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just 14% of the population have an actual bank account and only 25% have an account with either banking or any other financial institution.\n\nMore so, there is less than 35 kilometre of paved road for every 1 million inhabitants in the French-speaking country, making traditional branch-based banking unfeasible for most of its 90 million residents and the bid for financial inclusion arduous.\n\nThe digital finance revolution that\u2019s played out in the rest of Africa over the past decade thus cannot come soon enough for people in the central African nation, especially given it has a 47% mobile phone penetration rate, with the figure likely to grow further.\n\nA number of startups have sprung up over the past 5 years, which, through fintech innovations, have brought financial services closer to where people live and work. One such is Flash International, the largest fintech and payments aggregator in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlash operates a network of agents that allows people to do their banking on its mobile platform (FlashApp), putting financial services\u2014including remittance, payments, and other value-added services\u2014within easy reach.\n\nThe startup currently has roughly 3,500 agents and 90 branches, through which it serves more than 2 million customers. And instead of opening individual accounts with multiple banks or mobile money operators, Flash gives its users a card with which they can accept all payments.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Johannesen, whose 25 years of professional experience cuts across roles in financial institutions like Citi and mobile finance firms Moneytrans and TigoCash, started the company in 2018.\n\nSince its launch, Flash has recorded stellar growth and is currently integrated with several banks, mobile money, and telecom operators. It claims to process nearly 1 million transactions valued at over $50 million per month through its payment services and also facilitates more than 40,000 satellite TV subscription transactions, one of its value-added products.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the mission was to build the first Congolese fintech that would aggregate as many financial and value-added services as possible. \u201cWhat we currently have is an application with up to 27 different products and services, through which thousands of agents make a living out of,\u201d Johannesen recalled in a recent interview with TechCabal.\n\nA screenshot of the Flash web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nUnlike Flash, Okapi Finance was launched out of Sweden by founder Gis\u00e8le Mwepu, with DRC being one of the company\u2019s four markets across all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The startup rolled out its services in the country last year and currently has 170,000 customers. Its goal, according to Mwepu, is to reach up to 25 million people in the country in less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cDRC has over 90 million people and still there aren\u2019t many financial services solutions available. The opportunity is very huge. And the unbanked people aren\u2019t just individuals, they can be traders, merchants, or informal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Okapi platform allows both individual and enterprise customers carry out daily financial transactions like deposits, money transfers, and salary disbursements through its web and mobile platforms, USSD, and physical agents.\n\nOkapi has a special focus on getting more women included in the country\u2019s financial services ecosystem. Per Mwepu, up to 80% of the company\u2019s DRC users and 95% of the 17,000 merchants it\u2019s onboarded are women. For the latter, the company extends a line of credit\u2014weekly loans of around $50\u2014to help power their businesses.\n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion cannot be achieved by only allowing people to carry out payment transactions,\u201d Mwepu noted. \u201cWe need to increase their accessibility to a wide array of financial services.\u201d\n\nThrough the Okapi platform, microfinance banks and insurance providers can distribute their products, enabling them penetrate the informal sector and reach the unbanked population. In addition, users don\u2019t need a bank account to access these services and after signing up can apply for the Okapi Visa card.\n\nA screenshot of the Okapi Finance web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nWhereas Flash focuses on urban areas like Kinshasa with most of its agents in DRC\u2019s major cities, Faysal Axam\u2019s startup targets the unbanked population in rural areas, where more than half of the population resides.\n\nIn Goma, the capital and business hub of North Kivu province in the eastern DRC, Faysal Company offers a \u201cTap and Pay\u201d solution\u2014a magnetic card that interacts with POS machines and interfaces with a virtual wallet.\n\n\u201cFinancial flows are mostly in DRC\u2019s urban areas, not so much in peri-urban areas, and nearly not at all in rural areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile mobile money penetration rate is 72% in cities, it\u2019s only 28% in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCircumventing fintech challenges in DRC\n\nIn a country like DRC where road and internet infrastructure is below par, agents are especially effective at reaching rural dwellers and reducing deployment costs for providers.\n\nFor customers, agent networks reduce travelling time and security risks as they historically had to locate one of the only 500 bank branches available in the country\u2014which is ironically Africa\u2019s second-largest country by land area and the fourth most populous.\n\n\u201cMost transactions are done over the counter in DRC as there\u2019s still a very low penetration in terms of smartphones and internet access is not affordable. Also, the prevalent habit of the population is mainly to visit an agent for a transaction or service,\u201d Johannesen said.\n\nA high capital barrier for entry in the financial services space preserves the dominance of big banks like Ecobank and UBA as well as network operators (such as Vodacom Congo, Orange RDC, and Bharti Airtel who collectively control 35-40 million subscribers).\n\nFintech startups looking to partner with banks and telcos have had to deal with skepticism and aversion from the industry giants. Axam recalled it took Faysal almost a year and a half to get its first mobile money integration license in 2020 after the startup was rebuffed by banks and local mobile network operators for partnerships.\n\nA screenshot of the Faysal Company web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nMultipay Congo, DRC\u2019s first inter-banking platform, was launched in 2015 to create interoperability between payment platforms like ATMs and point of sale machines.\n\nBut the framework doesn\u2019t make integrating with banks and telcos any easier for fintechs, according to Mwepu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to achieve financial inclusion without interoperability of solutions from other stakeholders like banks and telcos. We have to work together,\u201d the Okapi Finance founder said.\n\nOn the back of a successful partnership with Orange, Faysal\u2019s customer base has exceeded 10,000. Although that\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s significant nonetheless in a country where more than 70% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day and most have no immediate incentives to open financial accounts.\n\nAxam added that Faysal\u2019s growth is also because the solution can be used offline, even in areas without internet connectivity.\n\nWith internet access at around 17%, feature phones \u2013 which retail at about $20 \u2013 play a huge role in enabling Congolese to access digital finance services. Faysal, for instance, gets most of its traction from the USSD feature as Goma dwellers often must seek a mountaintop just to access 2G cell phone coverage.\n\nIn addition, while banks and telcos boast sufficient financial muscle to build and scale their products, startups lack access to sufficient finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t have finance, investors, incubators, and accelerators, especially in Goma,\u201d Axam said, citing security issues as a challenge that makes it hard for investors to trust the ecosystem. \u201cMany excellent solutions here can\u2019t get continental or international exposure because of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to note that the DRC\u2019s fintech landscape is practically nascent with only 12 startups playing in the space as of 2018, per a report from Microsave and MasterCard. But the digital finance seeds are clearly beginning to take root and there are concrete reasons to be bullish about the opportunities in DRC for fintech and its prospect to attract investors.\n\nWith startups like Flash, Okapi, Faysal, alongside remittance fintechs, partnerships like the Mastercard and Billetera deal targeting the millions of financially excluded residents, as well as the government\u2019s increasing shift towards virtual payments for its over thousands of civil servants, one can anticipate a radical digital finance expansion in the coming years as DRC moves to replicate other African countries\u2019 successes, slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cFintechs in DRC are beginning to thrive. It\u2019s definitely promising but a better infrastructural coverage is crucial to realising full potential,\u201d said Noel K. Tshiani founder of Congo Business Network, an international network of Congolese professionals and entrepreneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the vision of the DRC government under President Felix Tshisekedi and its ambitious digitisation program aligned with the country\u2019s National Digital Plan.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu met at a birthday party in Abuja, Nigeria, they knew they\u2019d make good friends; what they didn\u2019t know was, they would make good co-founders as well. But 8 years into their friendship, they have built and run a couple of projects and businesses together and, now, they are focused on building Pivo, a startup they envision will be the neobank for trade in Africa. Like AfreximBank but faster and digitally operated.\n\nThe big picture is to be the go-to neobank for trade in Africa by the end of this year, or next.\n\nPivo entered the market with Pivo Capital, a credit-focused financial services platform for supply chain small and medium businesses (SMEs), because of the co-founders\u2019 track record in the supply chain industry, especially the logistics aspect.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLong before Pivo, Amadi-Emina, a software engineer, worked as a tech consultant for Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for over 2 years. She left INEC in 2017 to found her first startup Jalo, a venture-backed on-demand delivery company that focused on Nigeria\u2019s North-Central market and served e-commerce platforms like Jumia and Konga in that region.\n\nIn August 2018, Amadi-Emina joined Kobo360 after the logistic startup acquired Jalo in an acquihire deal. She remained at Kobo360 for a little over 3 years before leaving last year to focus on Pivo.\n\nFor Akwiwu, a trained lawyer who claimed to have stumbled on tech by chance and the influence of friends like Amadi-Emina, her law career, which started officially in 2013, spanned across law firms and companies like Gilmor Engineering, one of the biggest engineering firms in Nigeria, where she worked for over 6 years.\n\nBut, along the line, she started playing with project and product management and operations, monitoring projects, and product development lifecycles on the side. Last year, she decided to transition fully into tech. She left law to focus on building Pivo and getting a master\u2019s degree in software development while at it.\n\nWith Amadi-Emina\u2019s experience in the logistics side of the supply chain, having worked and led the port operation effort at Kobo360, Akwiwu\u2019s experience in law, and their collective knowledge of running an exportation business, building a business that serves the logistics arm of the supply chain was a no-brainer.\n\nLogistics supply chain is Pivo\u2019s first stop\n\nIn Africa, access to credit is still one of the biggest challenges small businesses deal with, especially small supply chain businesses. Supply chain businesses usually have a short time to execute a contract, and due to the excessive bureaucracy and numerous requirements, acquiring credit from traditional financial institutions takes a long time, therefore these businesses are automatically at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is where Pivo comes in.\n\nA truck loading at the port. Image source: Lori\n\nLaunched in September last year, Pivo provides flexible and quick financing options for supply chain businesses like logistics service providers, clearing and forwarding businesses, and FMCG distributors. Pivo is like a third-party partner in a transaction between a buyer and a seller. But to understand what Pivo does, one must first understand how supply chain financing works.\n\nSupply chain finance is a type of cash advance suppliers receive from lenders to fulfill a transaction or contract before the buyer pays them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: a merchant wants to supply a buyer with goods but needs some working capital to see the transaction through before the buyer pays them. So the merchant approaches the lender (that would be Pivo, in this case) for a credit. The lender then collects all required information to check for the legitimacy of their transaction or contract claim with the buyer, then disburses the credit once the buyer confirms the contract.\n\nThe above illustration explains Pivo at its core. Once a business finishes their KYC and asks for credit, Pivo prompts them to supply all the information about the transaction they need financing for. After that, Pivo profiles the business seeking credit for worthiness, runs a risk assessment on the transaction, and then profiles the businesses they are doing the transaction with, to ascertain whether they are credible and good for the money.\n\nOnce everything checks out and the buyer agrees to pay into the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, Pivo then disburses the loan. In partnership with Providus Bank, Pivo provides its customers with a business account that facilitates remittance. So, after the money lands in the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, the startup takes its dues.\n\nAll these checks and assessments help Pivo to finance only creditworthy customers and less-risky transactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to ensure 98% recovery on every single capital we deploy to our customers,\u201d Amadi-Emina told TechCabal.\n\nAmadi-Emina also mentioned that the average capital requests they\u2019ve received per customer is about $10,000. And while they cater for credits within the range of $5,000 from the company\u2019s balance sheet, requests above $5,000 are passed to their credit partners.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nFor now, the startup is still building in a stealth mode and according to the CEO Amadi-Emina, Pivo currently has about 250 direct SMEs customers and 5 ecosystem leads, which are the larger corporations that Pivo serve the SMEs within their value chain through embedded finance. Each ecosystem lead is reported to have about 500 to 1,000 SMEs.\n\nThe startup lists some of the top logistic companies in Africa as its ecosystem lead customers including Jetstream Africa, SabiRoad, Vee Logistics, and MVx.\n\nOn the side of its loan book, the co-founders said they have disbursed $1 million worth of credit out of over $2 million worth of applications that they have received since launch.\n\nThe company makes money from the interest charged on the credit disbursed, management fees, and the one-off charges from account creation. Akwiwu believes that as they continue to add more offerings, they will have more sources of revenue.\n\nThe startup has also raised a 6-figure preseed from Microtraction, FirstCheck Africa, Ventures Platform, Mercy Corps Venture, Rally Cap Ventures, Metis Capital Partner, Bold Angel Fund, and recently just got into the ODX accelerator programme where it\u2019s entitled to $125,000 for a 7% equity stake.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFor Akwiwu and Amadi-Emma, the roadmap is clear and they already have new products that will help them become a full-fledged neobank for trade in the works. For example, products like Invoice Factoring and Pivo Plus, which includes insurance and corporate compliance offerings, are already in the testing phase.\n\nThe company is currently only operational in Nigeria with the plan to expand into Ghana before the end of the year.\n\nThe competition in the credit market in Africa is heating up and it\u2019s good for SMEs. While there are new upstarts springing up to provide credit for businesses, the bigger ones are also making a fray into the scene. For instance, Flutterwave, the unicorn fintech, has joined the credit space with the recent announcement of Flutterwave Capital.\n\nWhile other startups like Payhippo, Lendigo, Float, and even Brass have successfully built a digital financial institution that provides credit for African SMEs, Pivo is the only one playing strictly in the supply chain sector, at least that we know of at the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The total worth of disbursed credit has been changed from $980,000 to $1 million. Between the time we interviewed the founders and the date this article was published, Pivo disbursed another $20,000 in credit.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other climes \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.

The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart-addressing startup, OkHi has announced a seed extension round of $1.5 million after a seed round of the same amount in 2020. Following the close of this seed round, the startup is set to focus on onboarding more institutions as it works towards having one million verified addresses in its database by 2022.\n\nThis round had new and existing investors such as Founders Factory Africa, Betatron, Interswitch, Chapel Hill Denham, and Flutterwave executives; other investors include EXFI (a syndicate of ex-Google employees) and Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola.\n\nSince the 1960s, when much of Africa gained independence, the urbanisation rate has grown rapidly. At the time of gaining independence, 80% of the population lived in rural areas. However, that figure currently stands at 50% and keeps growing annually.\n\nThis growth has been accompanied by the challenge of a proper addressing system for the continent. According to the United Nations, about 400 million of the 4 billion people who have no addresses live in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of a proper addressing system presents governments, service providers, and residents with numerous problems. For example, how is an eCommerce business supposed to deliver an order to the correct location without a reliable method of verifying a customer\u2019s address?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder and CEO of OkHi, Timbo Drayson\n\nUnsurprisingly, this challenge results in businesses losing tons of money while lives are lost because essential services providers can\u2019t reach their locations.\n\nIn Nigeria, anyone opening a bank account has to submit documentation for address verification. For most people, this is a utility bill. A human agent deployed by the bank then steps out to verify the address on the utility bill supplied by the prospective customer. Apparently, this method is inefficient and unreliable as some people may not have a valid utility bill and would have to use utility bills that do not belong to them.\n\nWhile travelling across Africa in 2014, Timbo Drayson, an ex-Googler, discovered that Google Maps did not work perfectly in Africa. With this realisation, he built OkHi in Kenya to provide address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.\n\nWhile there have been solutions such as Google\u2019s \u201cPlus Codes,\u201d OkHi\u2019s solution is different because it focuses on addressing people and not locations.\n\nVerifying one million addresses\n\nIn December 2020, the startup launched in Nigeria after reportedly verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya. This launch also saw it partner with fintech giant, Interswitch, which doubles as an investor. Drayson explained the reason for this move on a call with Techpoint Africa.\n\n\u201cWe showed some amazing success in Kenya where we were focused on solving the addressing problem for delivery businesses, and we showed great traction. However, the goal and the vision of OkHi has always remained the same, which is to enable half the world who don\u2019t have a physical address to be included.\n\n\u201cA great use case for that is address verification and being able to use your address to help onboard financial services. What we found when we tried to approach this in Kenya was that it wasn\u2019t the best place to basically build and go to market with address verification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike Nigeria, Kenya has a vast mobile money market dominated by Safaricom and M-Pesa. Consequently, fintech startups cannot generate as much traction as their Nigerian counterparts. A meeting with Interswitch was also a significant factor in the startup\u2019s decision to move to Nigeria.\n\nWith broad coverage of the Nigerian market, Interswitch offers the startup the opportunity to tap into its vast network of financial institutions. In October 2021, OkHi announced a partnership with Quickteller that enables its customers to verify their addresses digitally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s great about Interswitch is essentially that they already serve our target user base, which is both consumers that need to have verified addresses and the banks and fintechs that need to use it,\u201d Drayson stated.\n\nIn addition to Quickteller, OkHi is running a pilot program with Stanbic IBTC Bank \u2014 a Nigerian commercial bank \u2014 that enables the bank\u2019s customers to verify their addresses digitally. Based on this partnership, Drayson noted that in addition to being more accurate, OkHi\u2019s solution is four times faster than human agents and can be done at half the cost.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a very rich pipeline of customers, both banks and fintechs that are currently integrating or going live in pilot. Our focus is just to execute on that and make sure that by 2022, we have about a million people using OkHi and verifying their addresses with us.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing users with a digitally verifiable address, the startup\u2019s solution can notify businesses when a user changes their address. To do this, it makes use of data from their smartphone.\n\nSuch technology could create privacy concerns for users, and Drayson revealed that it allows users to opt out of using the solution whenever they like. In addition, they also adhere to the guidelines stipulated by the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).\n\nBreaking down OkHi\u2019s business model\n\nAddress verification can be broken down into three major categories: collecting an accurate address, verifying the address, and delivering to the address.\n\nOkHi has three products \u2014 OkCollect, OkVerify, and OkGo \u2014 covering these functions. OkCollect uses a photo and GPS to verify addresses; OkVerify uses data from a customer\u2019s phone, while OkGo serves as a Google Maps of sorts, enabling anyone to navigate OkHi addresses.\n\nWhile customers can use their OkHi addresses for free, OkHi charges businesses \u20a6500 (~$1) every time they verify a customer\u2019s address using OkHi. Although other startups provide verification services in Nigeria, most focus on document and identity verification.\n\n\u201cWhile there are a number of identity verification players who do document and biometric verification, for example, Smile Identity, most of them are more potential partners than competitors because while they offer full digital KYC solutions to businesses, they do not provide digital address verification. Therefore, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to power their address verification digitally,\u201d Drayson told Techpoint Africa.\n\nBuilding as pioneers\n\nBuilding a business comes with unique challenges, and Drayson shares that most of their challenges come with playing in a new space with no blueprint to follow. Consequently, they have had to convince investors and customers alike of the merits of their solution.\n\n\u201cAs a new business and technology that the world has never seen before, we have had to work hard to earn the trust of our early adopters, who are the pioneers taking our solution to market.\n\n\u201cWhile we have raised over $4m in total to date, and of course, there is still a lot of learning along the way; ultimately, we\u2019re inventing a new category of business here. It\u2019s an untrodden path with no proof points anywhere in the world, so it\u2019s just been perseverance to close the investors we have today, who I\u2019m thankful to for their money and advice.\u201d\n\nWhile the focus is currently on financial institutions, there are plans to start offering services to other sectors such as food delivery, ride-hailing, and eCommerce in 2022. Having tried and succeeded in Kenya, the startup would be in familiar territory if that were to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine is causing turmoil in global markets on account of massive re-pricing of commodities due to supply chain disruptions and the effect of bruising sanctions. This is taking a toll on many economies, including Nigeria\u2019s, and worsening the economic woes facing Nigerians.\n\nThe prices of commodities such as crude, natural gas, aluminium, nickel, wheat, and other commodities are soaring to record levels, leaving markets in disarray.\n\nThe price of a litre of diesel has skyrocketed to a record high of N600, two weeks into Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, from around N420-N450, as oil prices climbed above $120 a barrel, worsening inflation outlook in Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nManufacturers, retail outlets and small businesses who rely on diesel to power their machines have had to raise prices of manufactured goods and services even as consumers grapple with lower purchasing power.\n\n\u201cThe immediate implication of the price of diesel at above N600 per litre is the increase in cost of production and logistics which can translate to higher prices of products,\u201d Chinyere Almona, director general (DG) of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), said.\n\n\u201cWe should expect a rise in inflation above the 15.60 percent as at January. The rate of 13 percent assumed for the MTEF 2022 to 2024 is threatened in the short-term, and except the right interventions apply, we may miss this target even in the medium term,\u201d she added.\n\nAt 15.60 percent inflation rate, it means someone earning N200,000 a month is actually taking home N168,800.\n\nAccording to the LCCI DG, the supply chain disruption arising from the Russia/Ukraine crisis is expected to put more inflationary pressures on the system to cause an uptick in inflation rate into the second quarter of 2022.\n\nExperts say this situation would lead consumers to keep rationing income to prioritise necessities, remove any incentives to save and worsen the rate of emigration and crime.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy, over the last decade, has grown considerably pre-COVID. Yet this economic growth has not impacted significantly on the level of poverty and economic inequality in the country,\u201d said Margery Chuba Okadigbo, chairman of NNPC Ltd board, in an address at an oil conference on Tuesday, while speaking on lack of opportunities and inclusion.\n\nRead also: Why Russia-Ukraine conflict threatens global breakfast table\n\nDomestic airfares have doubled within a month on the back of rising cost of aviation fuel, a by-product of the crude oil refining process. This has seen airlines band together to raise prices, disrupting the business plans of many.\n\nWith the landing cost of petrol now above N300 per litre, the Federal Government is paying a king\u2019s ransom to maintain the retail price band of N162-N165 per litre.\n\nSubsidy payments this year could surpass the budgeted oil revenue of N3.36 trillion which could erode modest gains on the fiscal front.\n\nBismarck Rewane, chief executive officer of Financial Derivatives Company Ltd, in the company\u2019s March presentation, said Nigeria was \u201cbetween the devil and the deep blue sea\u201d as most of the gains could easily be eroded.\n\n\u201cNigeria will benefit from higher oil prices, but subsidy will be a major problem,\u201d said Rewane.\n\nAnalysts project that the fiscal gap will be funded through borrowing, saying even that will bring its own problem in the form of higher debt service as interest rates rise.\n\nAccording to Almona, the government needs to focus on resolving the supply-side challenges that are pushing prices upward.\n\n\u201cWe have issues like exchange rate pressures due to a weakening naira, insecurity in production bases, high cost of logistics due to rising energy costs, etc.,\u201d she said.\n\nRussia is one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters of key raw materials, from crude oil and gas to wheat and aluminium, and the possible exclusion of supplies from the country due to sanctions has sent traders and importers into a frenzy.\n\nAluminium hit a record high of $3,850 a tonne, up nearly 13 percent and heading for its largest weekly gain ever; the Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s most-active wheat contract spiked 40 percent this week, the biggest weekly gain on record, while corn was up 17 percent and soybeans added nearly six percent, according to data from global commodity traders.\n\nRussia accounts for around six percent of global aluminium supply and exports around 35mt of wheat, or 17 percent of global export supply.",
          "summary": "Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine is causing turmoil in global markets on account of massive re-pricing of commodities due to supply chain disruptions and the effect of bruising sanctions.\nThis is taking a toll on many economies, including Nigeria\u2019s, and worsening the economic woes facing Nigerians.\nAt 15.60 percent inflation rate, it means someone earning N200,000 a month is actually taking home N168,800.\n\u201cNigeria will benefit from higher oil prices, but subsidy will be a major problem,\u201d said Rewane.\nRussia accounts for around six percent of global aluminium supply and exports around 35mt of wheat, or 17 percent of global export supply.",

          "text": "Airlines operating in Nigeria are now forced to make immediate payments for aviation fuel as the lingering scarcity of the commodity has triggered a rash of flight delays and cancellations in recent days.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that before the scarcity of the fuel, airlines usually paid marketers two or three days after the supply of the commodity.\n\nFindings show that despite the high cost of aviation fuel, airlines had since Tuesday adopted what was described as a \u2018pay as you go\u2019 strategy as marketers were unwilling to sell to them on credit.\n\nAirlines have, however, described the new measure as sustainable.\n\nKingsley Ezenwa, spokesperson for Dana Air, told BusinessDay that marketers insisted that amid the high cost of the product, cash must be paid before supply of the product would be made.\n\nAccording to him, airlines that have been able to meet this demand are getting a steady fuel supply.\n\nOil marketers, who craved anonymity, said the rise in crude oil prices globally had impacted the local market, adding that airlines that cleared their credit on time would get the product faster than airlines that owe after purchasing the product on credit.\n\nA visit by BusinessDay to Lagos local airport, Murtala Muhammed Airport 2, on Wednesday, showed that most flights were operated without delays or cancellations, indicating that the new measure was already making an impact.\n\nRead also: Airlines seen shifting to smaller planes over aviation fuel scarcity\n\nGeorge Uriesi, chief operating officer of Ibom Air, said the airline, which had some delays on Tuesday, was having seamless flight operations on Wednesday because it found a \u201ctemporal\u201d measure to ensure flights were operated without delays.\n\nUresi, who described the measure as \u2018very fragile,\u2019 said the price at which the airline was buying aviation fuel was not sustainable.\n\n\u201cAll airlines are making plans but we have to watch the terrain. You can plan for uncertainty but where aviation fuel is sold for N450 per litre and the next day it goes up to N600 and N800 the next day, what plans can be made to cushion this effect?\u201d Uriesi added.\n\nThe price of aviation fuel, which ranged from N230 to N250 per litre across different states in the country last year, rose this week to N590 in Lagos; N599 in Abuja and Port Harcourt; and N625 in Kano.\n\nIn a related development, six airlines, namely Air Peace, Azman Air, Arik Air, Aero Contractors, Max Air and United Nigeria, have engaged in a form of partnership or codeshare to enable them to leverage services that each of the airlines offer.\n\nDescribed as \u2018Spring Alliance,\u2019 the alliance allows passengers booked on any of these airlines to fly their sister airline in a situation where there are flight cancellations or delays, according to a joint statement.\n\nExplaining the initiative, Allen Onyema, CEO of Air Peace, said, \u201cWith this alliance, the flying public will reap the benefit. For example if Air Peace has a tech issue on any of its aircraft, the passengers of Air Peace need not to be delayed, if any member of this alliance is going to the same destination.\n\n\u201cAll we need to do is move the passengers over to that other airline, a member of the alliance, at no further cost to the passenger.\u201d\n\nOnyema described the initiative as a revolution in Nigeria\u2019s aviation sector, urging other airlines to tap into the benefits offered by the alliance by joining.\n\nAccording to him, the alliance is not limited to Nigerian airlines alone, as it is open to other airlines in Africa.\n\nHe said the alliance would help sustain airlines\u2019 operations and help the flying public experience seamless commuting whenever they choose to fly.\n\nObiora Okonkwo, the CEO of United Nigeria Airline, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Nigerian airlines are going through some situations and part of the ways to react to this is to have the passengers in mind. It is simply thinking out-of-the-box.\n\n\u201cWe are not reinventing the wheel, we are just adopting what we have seen that has worked in other places, and it will surely work in Nigeria so that the passengers going to the airport are more guaranteed that they will fly.\u201d",

Engr. Dave Umahi, the Governor of Ebonyi State to the Judgment of the FHC Abuja which ordered him and his Deputy to vacate office. I also demanded an apology and a retraction of the comments,\u201d Akpata said.\n\n\u201cFollowing that Statement, H.E. Engr. Umahi made extensive efforts to reach me and in the course of our conversation, I reiterated that the NBA has no interest in the case other than to ensure that the sanctity of the judicial system is protected & the rule of law respected\n\n\u201cIn line with our demands, H.E. Engr. Umahi addressed a cross section of Ebonyi State citizens, where he unreservedly apologised for his comments, clarified his intentions and very importantly too, called for calm while urging his people to refrain from denigrating the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cI will immediately transmit this apology to His Lordship, Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo and My Lord the Hon. Chief Justice of Nigeria, who is the head of the Judiciary in Nigeria, and urge them to also accept same.\n\n\u201cI must however reiterate that there is a well established procedure by law for challenging unfavourable decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction and the @NigBarAssoc under my administration will continue to fulfil its mandate by rising to the defence of the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and the sanctity of court orders.\n\n\u201cNow that the right thing has been done & the appeal process has been activated, we shall resume our backseat and allow the process take its course. As far as the NBA is concerned, this brings an end to this unfortunate episode but we hope that important lessons have been learnt.\u201d",

          "text": "Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, on Wednesday, apologized to the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) over some uncomplimentary remarks he made against justice Inyang Ekwo, the Abuja High Court judge who ordered his removal as governor.\n\nUmahi, who has appealed the court decision, apologised while addressing members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who held solidarity rally for him at the Udensi Rundabout, Abakaliki.\n\nThe NBA had in a statement by its president, Olumide Akpata earlier on Wednesday, berated Umahi for attacking the judge and demanded an apology from him.\n\nSpeaking at the rally, Umahi said that he has mobilized over seventeen (17) SANs to Appeal the judgement wherein he was sacked for defecting from the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the ruling APC.\n\nHe noted that he has no regrets in defecting to the ruling APC and threatened to engage in battle with the opposition party in Ebonyi State, especially for trying to distract his administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still the governor of Ebonyi state and I\u2019m still working. I said the lawyers of PDP are the ones doing forum shopping and I\u2019m going to write against the lawyers to NBA to discipline them because the judge was misled. The blame was not on the judge. The blame is on the PDP lawyers who misled the judge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m using the opportunity to let Nigerians know that nobody castigated the judge and we will not and because the matter was not before any judge.\n\n\u201cToday, we have appealed the judgement. We have done three things; we have done the appeal at Enugu, and when I say that, we have two judgements, I say that the judgement in Ebonyi state, which has equal powers with that of Abuja. We said we will obey the judgement in Ebonyi state. We will appeal the judgement of Abuja. We didn\u2019t say we will disobey otherwise we would have not appealed.\n\n\u201cWe are before the Appeal of Enugu state and that of Abuja. We have also filed a stay of execution. So, we are still the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi state\u201d he stated\n\nRecall that NBA in the said statement by its president Akpata earlier on Wednesday, said the governor\u2019s remarks, during a press conference in Abakaliki during which he described the court decision against him as \u201cjungle justice\u201d and Justice Inyang Ekwo, who delivered same as \u201ca hatchet man,\u201d while maintaining that he would not obey the order, were totally unacceptable.\n\nAkpata noted that Umahi was expected to have called for calm from his supporters and assured them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the judgment but instead gave such a response.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has noted with utter dismay, the unfortunate and totally unacceptable reaction of His Excellency, Dave Umahi to the Judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja delivered on 8th March 2022, coram Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo which inter-alia ordered him and H.E. Mr. Eric Kelechi Igwe to vacate the offices of Governor and Deputy Governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State on grounds of their defection from the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress,\u201d the NBA statement had said.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Judgment, Umahi, in the course of a Press Conference \u2013 video evidence of which is currently making the rounds on both new and mainstream media \u2013 threw caution to the wind and deployed very uncomplimentary adjectives and intemperate language in characterising both the Judgment and Hon. Justice Ekwo, including but not limited to describing the Judgment as \u201cjungle justice\u201d and His Lordship as \u201ca hatchet man\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs if these were not enough, Engr. Umahi accused the Court of \u201cmurdering justice\u201d and also arrogated to himself the judicial powers and magisterial authority to declare the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction as null and void while unashamedly declaring his intention to disregard the Judgment in favour of another.\n\n\u201cTo put it plainly, this is impunity of the highest order and executive rascality taken too far.\u201d\n\nAkpata emphasized that the NBA has no interest in the case in question, but cannot watch politicians act in total disregard of judicial pronouncements.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA has absolutely no interest in the outcome of the case in question and will continue to stay away from partisan politics, it is inconceivable that this Association that is charged with upholding the rule of law and defending the Judiciary would sit idly by in the face of this unprovoked and totally unwarranted attack on the Judiciary,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the leadership of the NBA has been inundated with calls from a cross-section of well meaning Nigerians who are understandably outraged by the utterances of Engr. Dave Umahi and who have rightly demanded that appropriate action be taken to protect the sanctity of the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we condemn without equivocation, Engr. Umahi\u2019s unfortunate diatribe which, if it had emanated from an average litigant, would still have been regarded as shocking but coming from one who occupies the exalted office of a State Governor, is nothing short of a national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the Judgment, one would have expected Engr. Umahi to sue for calm from his supporters and to assure them that all legal and constitutional avenues would be explored to challenge the judgment. For H.E. Engr. Umahi to instead resort to attacking and denigrating the high office of a Judge in this unprecedented manner is disgraceful, undemocratic and completely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cAs Kayode Eso, JSC of blessed memory famously noted, \u201c[t]he essence of the rule of law is that it should never operate under the rule of force or fear.\u201d We view Engr. Umahi\u2019s reaction to this Judgment as being consistent with the current penchant, on the part of those in the executive arm of government, for intimidating the Judiciary whilst taking advantage of the historical reluctance of that arm of government to rise to its own defence.\n\n\u201cIn light of the foregoing, the NBA hereby demands an immediate apology from H.E. Engr. Dave Umahi and a retraction of the comments he made against the person and Judgment of the Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court. It is also our demand that this apology and retraction be given as much media coverage as the Press Conference where the unfortunate comments were made.\u201d",

          "text": "A proposed sale of Chelsea F.C., one of Europe\u2019s leading soccer teams, was effectively blocked by the British government on Thursday when it froze the assets of the club\u2019s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich, as part of a wider set of sanctions announced against a group of wealthy Russian businessmen.\n\nThe government, in announcing its actions against Abramovich and six other Russian oligarchs, said it had taken steps to ensure Chelsea would be able to continue its operations and complete its schedule. To protect the club\u2019s interests, the government said, it issued Chelsea a license to continue its soccer-related activities, including a Premier League match at Norwich City on Thursday night.\n\nThe license, which the government said would be under \u201cconstant review,\u201d will ensure that the team\u2019s players and staff will continue to be paid; that fans holding season tickets can continue to attend games; and that the integrity of the Premier League, which is considered an important cultural asset and one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile exports, will not be affected.\n\nBut to ensure that no money flows to Abramovich, the club will no longer be able to sell new tickets to any games or sell merchandise online or in its stores. And its business and daily activities may be seriously complicated, affecting everything from travel to matches to the team\u2019s ability to buy and sell players in soccer\u2019s multibillion-dollar player trading market.\n\nThat ban also could make it impossible for Abramovich to follow through on his previously announced plans to sell Chelsea. Under the new sanctions, the British government will now have complete oversight of that process. The effect would be to heavily diminish any proposed sale price, but it could block a sale entirely since it is unlikely the government would allow such a large transfer of money \u2014 Abramovich was said to be seeking more than $2 billion for Chelsea \u2014 from being paid to an owner under sanctions.\n\n\u201cGiven the significant impact that today\u2019s sanctions would have on Chelsea football club and the potential knock on effects of this, the Government has this morning published a license which authorizes a number of football-related activities to continue at Chelsea,\u201d the British government said in its statement announcing the freezing of Abramovich\u2019s assets. \u201cThis includes permissions for the club to continue playing matches and other football related activity which will in turn protect the Premier League, the wider football pyramid, loyal fans and other clubs. This license will only allow certain explicitly named actions to ensure the designated individual is not able to circumvent U.K. sanctions.\u201d",

          "text": "On Wednesday, a major development occurred in the aviation industry as Nigerian airlines namely: Air Peace, Azman Air, United Nigeria Airline, Arik Air, Aero Contractors and Max Air announced an alliance called the \u2018Spring Alliance\u2019, to mutually support one another\u2019s operations in order to provide better service to passengers.\n\nThe airlines signed the alliance in Lagos on Tuesday and vowed to work together by engaging in interline collaboration to protect their operations and improve service delivery to passengers.\n\nThe objective of the alliance is curb flight delays among the six partners, give one another technical support and also ensure that passengers are airlifted by any of the members, no matter, which airline\u2019s ticket the passengers have.\n\nFor example, if Arik Air flight operating from Port Harcourt to Lagos suffered bird strike, instead of waiting for the airline to deploy another aircraft, any of the airlines that is a member of the alliance would airlift Arik Air passengers to Lagos.\n\nThe operators said such cooperation had sustained many airlines in the world, stressing that they needed to key into it to ensure their survival.\n\nSpeaking on the alliance, the Chairman of Air Peace and Vice-president of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), Allen Onyema, said the Spring Alliance was for the benefit of the passengers who fly with the six airlines.\n\nHe said globally there are many of such alliances, which airlines key into, listing such to include the Star Alliance, One World and many others.\n\nAccording to him, airlines key into such alliance for the benefit of both the passengers and the airlines.\n\n\u201cSo, today, in Nigeria, the 8th day of March 2022, some Nigerian airlines, notably, Air Peace, Azman Air, Arik Air, Aero Contractors, Max Air & United Nigeria have decided to come together to form what we call the Spring Alliance.\n\n\u201cThe name of this alliance is Spring Alliance. We decided to come together to do this for the benefit of the flying public that use the opportunities provided by these airlines to fly.\n\n\u201cBy this alliance our passengers are protected whenever there is a problem with one airline. It is our response to the complaints of the flying public, so this alliance will enable us to satisfy them. With this alliance and what we are going to be doing henceforth, the flying public will reap the benefit.\n\n\u201cFor example if Air Peace has a tech issue on any of its aircraft, the passengers of Air Peace need not to be delayed, if any member of this alliance is going to the same destination, all we need to do is move the passengers to other airline, a member of the alliance, at no further cost to the passenger.\u201d\n\nOnyema described the initiative as noble and a revolutionary one in Nigeria\u2019s aviation sector. He urged other airlines to tap into the benefits offered by the alliance by joining.\n\nHe said the Spring Alliance was not limited to Nigerian airlines alone, as other African airlines may wish to join, adding that the alliance originated from Nigeria, but is open to the world.\n\n\u201cThis will help aviation, it will help the sustainability of our operations, it will help the cause of the flying public to experience seamless commuting whenever they choose to. So we are hereby putting our signatories to these papers today, launching this idea that will revolutionise Nigeria\u2019s scheduled flight operations for the better\u201d, Onyema said.\n\nTo the Managing Director, Aero Contractors, Capt. Abdullahi Mahmood, the formation of the Spring Alliance was a historic move, adding that it prioritises the satisfaction of passengers.\n\n\u201cHistory has been made here today in Nigeria, and this is the first time something like this is happening in Nigeria\u2019s aviation industry. You can see that the airline operators are fully committed to making sure that our passengers are satisfied.\n\n\u201cAs we say, for every challenge, you see an opportunity and probably this is the time that we have seen an opportunity whereby the airlines can come together, work together and have a healthy competition; whereby at the end of the day, we make our passengers happy and safe.\n\n\u201cSafety is the number one priority and this is what we stand for and coming together, like my colleagues rightly said, you find out that all these delays are caused by problems that passengers do not know and we just carry them from one point to another on time and make sure that everything goes smoothly.\n\n\u201cWe are asking passengers to give their utmost cooperation, we are doing our best, it is a challenging situation we find ourselves but yes, we are all in this together and we are hopefully coming out together,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nThe CEO of United Nigeria Airline, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, said the alliance would revolutionise flight services for the Nigerian flying public, as passenger satisfaction is the major objective behind the formation of the alliance.\n\nAccording to Okonkwo, \u201cToday, history has been made at this landmark event.
