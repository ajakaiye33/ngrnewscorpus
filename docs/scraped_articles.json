          "text": "Labour unions in the aviation sector have begun discussions with the Federal Government on workers\u2019 welfare and the repayment of about $1bn loan which the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria would bear once the concession of the country\u2019s four major airports scales through.\n\nIt was also learnt that the unions had gone through the Outline Business Case for the concession process and had submitted their concerns about the OBC to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika.\n\nThis came as senior officials of the Federal Ministry of Aviation told our correspondent that investors from all continents and global aviation centres were sending in applications for the concession of the airports.\n\nIn July, the Federal Government officially commenced the search for concessionaires to manage Nigeria\u2019s four major airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt.\n\nIt made this public through the aviation ministry in its requests for prequalification for the concession of four international airport terminals and related services.\n\nIn August, aviation unions declared that the Federal Government would not succeed in its concession plan on the facilities as there were so many legal tussles and other baggage around the operations of the four airports.\n\nThey argued that FAAN would be put at a disadvantage of bearing the burden $1bn loan repayment if the Federal Government continued with its concession policy.\n\nThe unions include the National Union of Air Transport Employees, Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals and the Nigerian Union of Pensioners, FAAN branch.\n\nThe General-Secretary of NUATE, Ocheme Aba, who spoke on behalf of the unions, had said, \u201cWhile the sharing ratio is proposed to be 60:40 in favour of the concessionaire, the disadvantaged FAAN is made to bear the repayment of the $1bn loan utilised to build some terminals, continue to pay emoluments of its pensioners, return 25 per cent of its Internally Generated Revenue to the government under the Fiscal Responsibility Act and maintain the remaining 18 airports in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut despite the opposition by the labour unions, the government on September 10, 2021, announced an extension of its airports\u2019 concession requests for prequalification and set October 25, 2021, as the new deadline.\n\nIt explained that the request for prequalification submission deadline was extended following numerous requests for its extension by interested concessionaires.\n\nWhen contacted on Friday and asked whether the unions were aware of the extension and if they were still opposed to the concession policy, officials of NUATE and ATSSSAN revealed that they had begun discussions with the government on the concerns of workers.\n\nNUATE\u2019s General-Secretary stated that a joint committee of the government and three aviation unions had been set up.\n\nAba said, \u201cPresently there is a joint government-union committee on the issues we raised as regards the concession. So they are looking at these issues.\n\n\u201cAnd until we complete that assignment we think it is better not to speak much now but to give them the opportunity to look at the issues critically.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what unions made up the committee, he replied, \u201cThe unions include NUATE, ATSSSAN and ANAP and we are in this committee together with the government.\u201d\n\nAba emphasised that the unions had earlier stressed that the concession process might not work because of the baggage around the airports\u2019 operations and the legal tussle that might arise.\n\nAlso, the National President, ATSSSAN, Illitrus Ahmadu, said the unions had eventually responded to the Outline Business Case for the airports\u2019 concession which was given to them to critique.\n\nAhmadu said, \u201cThe unions have finally responded to the OBC for the concession of the airports. Before now, there was never a response, rather there were petitions to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThere was never a response to the aviation ministry on the OBC. However, I can confirm to you that the unions have now responded, they have reviewed the OBC and have sent our position to the government. So we are awaiting the invitation for discussion from the government.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The idea is that we are pushing distributors from the office, but we are not pulling out from the distributors. We want to engage all the distributors in the channel of distribution to increase our market value because using only the distributors does not add value to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder these distributors, we have wholesalers and sub-distributors, so engaging both distributors will accelerate our sales return. The programme is quarterly; so it has three categories.\n\n\u201cWe expect those under the platinum category to do a minimum of 400 cases per month and 1,200 cases per quarter to qualify for the gift items. The second category, which is gold, is expected to do a minimum of 200 cases monthly, with 600 cases per quarter to qualify, while the third category, silver, is expected to do 80 cases per month, with 240 cases per quarter.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Electoral Offences Commission Bill, which was passed into law three months ago by the Nigeria Senate, is yet to be assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nChecks by DAILY POST revealed that the bill, which its legislative debate started much earlier and which was meticulously handled by the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), headed by Senator Kabir Gaya representing Kano South Senatorial district, was finally passed into law on 13th July, 2021.\n\nHowever, for undisclosed reasons, the bill has not been signed for it to become an act three months after it was passed into law.\n\nMuch and strategic as the Electoral Offences Commission bill was, it was believed that it would sanitise political elections in Nigeria. Unfortunately, neither has President Buhari raised an observation and return it to the National Assembly for harmonisation nor communicated his intention whatsoever on the bill.\n\nRecently, he signed the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), now Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which was on 16th August, 2021, while the last bill assented to was the Agricultural Research Council Amendment Bill (2021) which was signed into law on 8th October, 2021.\n\nConstitutionally, lawmakers have inherent powers to overrule or veto the President on unassented bill that is in the interest of citizens, but it couldn\u2019t be confirmed if the Senate would consider overruling the President on the Electoral Offences Commission bill, given its importance to the 2023 general election.\n\nIn the highlight of the bill, it states that the Commission will investigate election crimes, prosecute culprits and maintain records of electoral offenders.\n\nIt is recalled that there was jubilation across the nation over the provision of the bill which prescribes a 20-year jail term for ballot box snatchers during elections, if found guilty as well as sponsors of the crime.\n\nThe bill also proposed that any candidate or agent who damages or snatches ballot boxes, ballot papers or election materials before, during and after an election without the permission of the election official in charge of the polling station, shall be jailed for 20 years or fined N40 million.\n\nMoreso, if the bill wasn\u2019t signed or vetoed before the end of the session on May 29, 2023, it would lapse with the session.",

          "text": "The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao, has revealed that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has trained 171 special forces operatives to be deployed in troubled areas across the country to help to combat insecurity, including insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other crimes.\n\nAir Mashal Amao stated this at the graduation ceremony of 171 Special Forces Course 9/2021 held at the NAF Special Operations Command, Bauchi.\n\nHe informed that his vision when he assumed office as the Chief of Air Staff was to enhance and sustain critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives.\n\nAccording to him, one of the key drivers of the vision was purposeful training and human capacity development\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have sustained the drive to ensure that our personnel are well trained both at home and overseas.\n\n\u201cIn line with this, today 171 special operatives shall be graduating. These personnel will subsequently be deployed to our various theatres for force protection, personnel recovery and other direct-action tasks as required for the projection of airpower as required by operational exigencies,\u201d the NAF boss said.\n\nWhile saying that NAF bases and air assets have been targets of attacks from insurgents following successes recorded by its personnel in the fight against insurgency, banditry and other crimes, Amao declared that, that would not undermine its efforts to fight the enemy.\n\nHe added that NAF\u2019s successes in neutralising insurgents and bandits\u2019 capabilities have resulted in greatly degrading their operational capacity.\n\nHe said, \u201cour successes in shaping the battle space and neutralising adversary capabilities have resulted in greatly degrading operational capacity of bandits and insurgents in different operational theatres.\n\n\u201cIndeed, our ability to respond immediately have been key to quelling various hostile attacks on the civil populace. Accordingly, our ability to conduct air operations without hostile inference provides a foundation for our successes.\n\n\u201cOur successes, however, have rendered our bases, personnel and other air assets as significant targets for insurgents\u2019 attacks.\u201d\n\nHe added that to sustain the tempo, \u201cNAF requires well trained and motivated special forces to adequately protect its assets while carrying out other tasks in line with our operational exigencies\u201d.\n\nChief of Air Staff pledges support for National Research, Development foundation\n\nThe CAS, therefore, expressed optimism that the graduating students had acquired the basic skills and techniques required to conduct special operations pursuant to achieving NAF\u2019s operational objectives.\n\nSuch special operations, Amao declared, were critical, given the asymmetric security threats Nigeria was battling with today, saying that the threats required the armed forces\u2019, including NAF, interventions.\n\nHe urged the graduating students of Special Forces Course 9/2021 to exhibit what they learnt during the course whenever and wherever duty calls.\n\n\u201cThis call will require you to exhibit courage, commitment and loyalty in the discharge of your duties.\n\n\u201cOnce deployed, you are implored to treat the local populace with utmost respect as your task is to protect them from hostile threat.\n\n\u201cI know that military operations are normally clouded by a fog, making it difficult to discern the best course of action. In such situations, let our core values of \u2018Integrity First, Service before self and Excellence in all we do\u2019 guide you towards the best course of action and you will surely succeed,\u201d he charged the graduands.\n\nEarliee in his welcome address, the Air Officer Commanding, Ground Training Command, Air Vice Marshal Frank Oparah, informed that a total of 342 NAF personnel were screened for the Special Forces Course 9, 2021 (SF9/2021), but only 197 were picked to start the course.\n\nHe added that at the end of the training, only 171 personnel comprising three officers, 167 airmen and one airwoman graduated, which he said was a success rate of about 48 per cent.\n\nOparah said that special forces operations were characterised by speed, precision and destabilising shock effects and perseverance, saying these required forces specially selected to ensure the attainment of desired results.\n\n\u201cThese types of operations are even more important now considering that present threats to our national security are from non-state actors waging terrorist and insurgent campaigns against the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs such these newly bred operatives would be employed as part of our offensive to ensure normalcy and calm are restored to restive communities within Nigeria,\u201d Oparah said.",

Having seen no contrary remarks from the methodist Prelate, we are compelled to believe that he made that wild allegations, possibly to also dig deep into the former Governor\u2019s established norm, that what money cannot do (for greedy and selfish Nigerians) more money can do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the height of unfounded generalization by the Pastor Samuel Uche, whose statement implies that Akwa Ibom State under Udom Emmanuel is faring woefully.\u201d\n\nNigerian presidency must rotate to reflect federal character, not one ethnic group \u2013 Methodist Prelate",

          "text": "Time is the greatest enemy of tyrants. No matter the sanitary wash and the futile deodorants of evil deeds, the truth has a way of prevailing eventually over the cobwebs of lies and dishonesty. No matter the obfuscations and prevarications placed across its path, history will always vindicate the just, if not immediately but in the fullness of time. You can set the clock of human progress back but you cannot reset the time of retribution.\n\nIt is restitution time in Ouagadougou, the dusty and arid capital of the former Upper Volta. Famously renamed Burkina Faso, or the land of the noble and upright, by its most visionary and iconic leader, this is the time of symphony and perfect synchrony when a people live up to the billing of their name, when revolutionary acts of restitution and expiation mirror the collective aspirations and willed identity of a people. As the Yoruba people strikingly put it, our names sometimes haunt us.\n\nIt is Sankara fever in Burkina Faso. The entire nation is aglow as the people reclaim their abjured history in a festival of hope and national renewal. Last week, the trial of those who murdered an illustrious son of Africa got underway in the same capital where his name had been taboo for the better part of three decades and where there had been a determined official attempt to obliterate his glorious memory. Many African tyrants will be cowering in their bed at this moment. Blaise Compaore must be furtively watching developments from his luxurious liar in neighbouring Ivory Coast.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThirty four years ago, Thomas Sankara was gunned down in a daring afternoon putsch masterminded by his bosom friend and former revolutionary comrade in arms. It was the end of a brave but idealistic experimentation in people\u2019s power and purposeful governance. Sankara drove himself around in a battered Renault jalopy and could be found at the weekend painting and recoating his own official residence. It was too good to be true.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFor four days after killing his friend, Compaore could not appear in public, claiming that he had succumbed to malaria. The fever of coldly calculating and violent treachery can be very overpowering indeed. This was at a time when Compaore\u2019s emissaries, the two hapless majors who were later to fall to official sword themselves, were being cold-shouldered all over Africa with only Nigeria giving them a listening ear. Kenneth Kaunda drove them away and even our own General Obasanjo denounced the perfidy.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThere is a Shakespearean gloss to the tragedy. Without Blaise Compaore, there would have been no Thomas Sankara. The two were childhood friends and youthful idealists. It was Compaore who masterminded the lightning coup that brought his friend to power having slugged his way to the capital from the storied Po Brigade to terminate the power struggle between Sankara and the then head of state, Major Ouedrago, who had put him under house arrest.\n\nIn a clairvoyant moment of lucidity, Sankara had observed that if Compaore was plotting against him, it would be too late to do anything about it. And so it proved. For years, it was said that Sankara\u2019s father waited in vain for his former ward and adopted son to come and explain what happened between him and his adopted brother.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThere was an international and continental dimension to the conspiracy to eliminate the great philosopher ruler. France was uncomfortable with his revolutionary harangues and Marxist sabre-rattling. President Francois Mitterand described him as a cutting edge that cuts too sharply.\n\nNeighbouring Ivory Coast with its prosperous comprador ruling class felt he was a harbinger of bad news. The conservative military rulers elsewhere on the subcontinent felt he could inspire a revolutionary earthquake among the younger officer-class. He was a visionary ahead of his time. Now his time has come in a way and manner he himself could not have foreseen. History moves in a mysterious manner indeed.",

          "text": "More than one month after the video of her public humiliation by a female military officer Lieutenant Chika Viola Anele went viral, the pains of Ifeyinwa Fidelis, a serving youth corps member, are yet to be assuaged. She is alarmed that the military authorities have not pursued justice for her and mete out necessary punishment to the officer in question, who she claimed was sent on three-month training after the incident that has left her traumatised. With no clear sign that the military would help her get justice, she has vowed to do so through the law courts, INNOCENT DURU reports.\n\n\u2022 Victim relives how incident was almost swept under carpet\n\n\u2022 No need fighting over what\u2019s unnecessary \u2013 Victim\u2019s lawyer\n\n\u2022 Nigerian Army: Matter now before our directorate\n\n\u2022 Why we\u2019ve done nothing for victim \u2013 Anambra govt\n\nEZEIRUAKU Ifeyinwa Fidelis, a female youth corps member serving in Calabar, Cross River State, has been fear stricken since July 28, 2021 when she was brutalised and dehumanised by a female military officer, Lieutenant Chika Viola Anele.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHer voice quaked with disappointment while her body language evinced suspicion when our correspondent engaged her during the week.\n\n\u201cMe, I don\u2019t trust anybody for now o,\u201d she retorted when our correspondent requested for the contacts of her colleagues who witnessed her public humiliation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAt a point, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was always having the feeling that I should have fought with her. How could I kneel down and someone was doing all that to me?\n\n\u201cThe thing was disturbing me then. The female officer has not called me till date to apologise.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cAt a point, I was getting scared because I was not sure somebody was not after me,\u201d Ifeyinwa said in a comprehensive voice recording of the incident obtained by The Nation.\n\nContrary to information in the public domain that the video went viral immediately the incident occurred, Ifeyinwa said the incident happened about a month earlier, but when the military authorities were not forthcoming in giving her justice, she had to send it to her brother who subsequently sought the permission of her lawyer to release it online.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened since then (after reporting to the military authorities). Each time I go to them, they will say they are working on it. After then, she went for a three-week course in Jaji, Kaduna State. I know that once we end our service year, and I am not there again, the case will die,\u201d Ifeyinwa said in the recoding.\n\nI want justice for myself. One day, the commander of the brigade called us and asked to know who sent the video to NYSC. I said I didn\u2019t know. They now asked us to go.\n\n\u201cNYSC didn\u2019t come to check on me. They didn\u2019t even ask to know the corper (youth corps member) they did this to. They only called the commander and I don\u2019t know what they discussed.\n\n\u201cWhen I didn\u2019t know what to do, I went to get a lawyer. That was when the pressure was now high. They started arranging things. They told the state coordinator that I did this and that.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC now called me and they were saying did I write through them before going to get a lawyer? They said why didn\u2019t I tell them what was happening? Even when I was explaining to the state coordinator, I wanted to show him the video but he said that he had seen it.\n\n\u201cThey said I should bring down the case. They gave me book and biro and asked me to write that I have withdrawn the case and that I should write formally through them. I left them and went away. I didn\u2019t write anything and didn\u2019t withdraw the case.\u201d\n\nThe narrative, according to the victim, took a new dimension \u201cwhen I got a lawyer. I had to tell one of my brothers that this is what is happening to me in Calabar.\n\n\u201cWhen I sent the video to him, he was mad. He called the lawyer and asked if he could post the video online and the lawyer said yes. My brother gave the video to different bloggers, making the whole thing to go viral.\n\n\u201cWhen the video went viral, maybe the DG of NYSC saw it and then called the commander to say that he saw a video where an army officer was dehumanising a female corper. They were now calling him.\n\n\u201cWhen the thing went viral, NYSC called and said I should go home for my own safety. The next day, they booked a flight for me. Since then, nobody has called me,\u201d she added.\n\nCompletely not happy that the military authorities are treating the matter with kid gloves, Ifeyinwa told The Nation that her lawyer was going to file the case in court. \u201cI am suing the lady and the army authorities. I am suing both of them,\u201d she said.\n\nProviding a detailed account of how her dehumanizat ion occurred in the audio recording, she said: \u201cThe incident happened on July 28, but the video went viral on September 23. It was after I sent it to my brother that the thing went viral.\n\n\u201cThe incident started when the commander of the brigade hosted a drilling competition. I was chosen as part of those who would usher in guests.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the place, Ebutu Barracks, I saw one of my captain friends who is a Muslim and married. We played ayo game together. When I saw him, I tapped him and said that he was even there before the ushers. We started laughing only for that lady to shout at me, saying you don\u2019t touch an officer in uniform.\n\n\u201cI went back. When I was standing in my position, another officer \u2013 a Lieutenant Colonel came and offered me a handshake, but I said we were told not to shake officers in uniform. The female officer who was behind me said, \u2018you can shake but don\u2019t touch\u2019. I didn\u2019t say anything but kept standing.\n\n\u201cShe was in charge of the small chops we were to share. They counted the ones they would give to umpires and gave us the rest to share. After sharing it, I went back to my post.\n\n\u201cOne Major called me to change it for him. I told him that those ones he was seeing there were for the umpires and that they had already counted them.\n\n\u201cThe Major insisted but I didn\u2019t know what to do. We were not trained to challenge an officer in front of guests. I then went back to the female officer for her to know how to settle the issue. But she started insulting me.\n\nRead Also: Woman impregnated twice by her twin brother insists on marrying him\n\n\u201cShe said I don\u2019t have sense and that was I not there when they said those ones were for the umpires and what did I want her to do.\u201d\n\nBefore then, Ifeyinwa said, \u201cshe gave me one to keep till whenever we were hungry. She ordered me to go and bring that one and give it to the man since I don\u2019t have sense. So I went and brought it and gave it to the man.\n\n\u201cWhen the event was over, she called me again and said why was I behaving as if I didn\u2019t have sense- that they said this one was for the umpires but why was I bringing that one to her and what did I want her to do.\n\n\u201cWhen she insulted me, I was not happy but I didn\u2019t say anything. They always threatened to report acts of indiscipline to the NYSC. The incident happened at my place of primary assignment, (PPA). When she was telling me all this, I never responded.\n\n\u201cI later went to the back of the barracks. I saw a senior officer, Major Ango, who asked why I was angry. I opened up to him and said I didn\u2019t like the way they were talking to us. He was asking me who the person was. I then told him it was Lieutenant Chika Anele.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between the two other them (Major Ango and Chika). I don\u2019t know what he said to her. On the 28 of July, she called for a meeting and brought me out. She asked the school I graduated from and I told her University of Lagos. She asked for the course I studied and I told her Linguistics. She asked for my GP and I told her.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cShe then asked if there is any comparison between a student of Mandona that studied Mass Communication and student of UNILAG that studied Linguistics. Nobody answered her. She then ordered me to go and put on my six over seven- that is my NYSC uniform.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to my room, I saw that my period just started. She didn\u2019t time me when I left. If they time you and you don\u2019t meet up\u2026..ehen. But she never timed me. When I saw that my period had come, I had to wash off. She then sent a female corper to come and check me.\n\n\u201cWhen the corper came, she was asking me where I was. I told her that I was bathing and would be coming afterwards. The corper then went and told her that I was bathing. She thereafter came to my room.\n\n\u201cWhen she came, she saw that I was dressing up. She started shouting that she asked me to go and dress up and I went to bathe. She then ordered the corpers to fetch water. She took me to the back of the barracks where nobody would see her. She called all the corpers to come and then called one boy to do press up.\n\n\u201cShe said I should also do press up. I said I no. She said I should roll on the ground with my uniform and I replied that I could not do it. She said I should do frog jump and I said I could not do it. She then said I should be doing frog jump where I was, and I started doing it.\u201d\n\nShe further said: \u201cWhen she saw that it was not paining me, she asked me to kneel down. When I knelt down, she asked them to bring block which I raised above my head. She then said that if I didn\u2019t cry she would not leave me.\n\n\u201cWhen I got tired, I threw away the stone and told her that I did not kill somebody and didn\u2019t steal and could not carry the stone any longer. She then said my English was quack and that my parents would be happy that they are paying school fees.\n\n\u201cShe started insulting me, saying that one string of her hair would buy my life and how much are we collecting as allowee (allowance). They told her it is N33,000. She then multiplied it by 12 months and said \u2018N300 and something thousand, and that she cannot touch that kind of money in her life.\n\n\u201cShe now asked them to bring sand. She mixed it inside water and started pouring it on my head. She opened my uniform and made sure she poured it all over my body.\n\n\u201cWhile she was pouring it, she was insulting me. She said I opened my gutter mouth to tell her superior that if not for army uniform that if she sees me outside, would she talk to me.\n\n\u201cWhen the water she was pouring on my body was itching me, I had to remove my bra. When I removed it, she said this is the cheap bra that I wear and when last did I wash it, calling me a dirty pig. She said after dealing with me today, the next time, I would not open this my mouth to mention her name.\n\n\u201cWhile she was doing all that, I don\u2019t know who called her. She was happy and told that person that she had done her sand and water thing to me, and that the highest thing I would do was to call my godfather and she would call hers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they called her on the phone, she now left. When she left, everybody dismissed. I went to somebody that had a phone and told him to take my photogragh. I wanted to have evidence so that if I wanted to report her, I would show them what she did to me. There, if you don\u2019t have evidence, they would not answer you.\n\n\u201cAfter the guy had snapped me, I went to get water to bathe. After bathing, I started washing my uniform. It was while doing this that they called me that one Captain wanted to see me. She was with the woman when I got there. She was telling the woman how she did her water and sand thing to me.\n\n\u201cThe woman was like why did I tell the senior officer that if not that she is in army uniform, if she saw me outside would she talk to me? I told her that I never said so.\n\n\u201cAs they were talking, the commander of the brigade now called that he saw a video. They asked me who videoed it and I said I didn\u2019t know. They said the commander wanted to see everybody. Before we went to see the commander, she said the deed had been done.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to where the commander was, the commander now called me and asked what happened. I explained everything to him. The commander is Brigadier Commander P.P. Mallam. He said he was sorry. He called all the corpers and said we should go, and that he was sorry for all that the female officer did to me.\n\n\u201cWhen we left, everybody went to their lodge. The female officer didn\u2019t know that when she was doing all that to me, they were recording her.\u201d\n\nAlthough she has left Calabar, her place of posting, she said she was paid her allowance for last month.\n\n\u201cMy passing out date is October 21, 2021. They said they would send everything to me. I don\u2019t know how I will do my clearance,\u201d she told our correspondent.\n\nNo need fighting over what\u2019s unnecessary \u2013 Victim\u2019s lawyer\n\nWhen our correspondent reached out to Ifeyinwa\u2019s lawyer, Barrister Eni Okoi, he said: \u201cIf you call us next week, we will give you a feedback. NYSC has moved her out of Calabar. They have done something about it. It is because of them she\u2019s there.\n\n\u201cWhen they became aware of this, they had to move her out of the place. NYSC has not reached out to me, but we have seen their action and it is in good fate. I don\u2019t think there is any need fighting over what is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cThe military authorities have not reached out to us at all. By next week, events will start unfolding.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson of the 13th Brigade, Calabar where the incident occurred told The Nation that the issue was more with her.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have sent a report already.

In a telephone interview with our correspondent, he said: \u201cI must confess that I have been so busy and preoccupied by the election that I didn\u2019t know she is from Anambra. Sorry. Thanks for letting me know.\n\n\u201cYou just told me she is from Anambra. The family didn\u2019t get in touch with us. I have an open door policy. I cannot tell you right now.

          "title": "OLUWO OF IWO: I\u2019m not in hurry to remarry",
          "text": "Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi is the traditional ruler of Iwo, Osun State. Regarded by many as controversial, the flamboyant monarch spoke with GBENGA ADERANTI on many issues including his estranged former queen, his war experience in Liberia and the need for monarchical revolution. Excerpts:\n\nYou seem to be bringing a kind of revolution to the monarchical institution by doing away with some traditional practices. How receptive are your people to this?\n\nChange is something that is not easy. Everything in life is about sacrifice. Sacrifice means to make yourself uncomfortable for the benefit of others and to impact the future generation. When you want to make a change, you are trying to take people away from oppression; you try to open peoples\u2019 eyes. I don\u2019t want to oppress my future. My future is the youths of today. What they were used to that make them to be in this situation today, should we continue doing things this way that is not working or should we toe another path? When we keep doing the same thing, you don\u2019t expect different results.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIf some leaders of today even know that their generation failed these youths, are the youths of today going to follow the path of the failed generation or will we find our own paths by ourselves just like the slaves that we sold but found their own path to make a living? Some of them studied Law. Some of them went into the army, and when they came back, they became leaders. I will not oppress my future which is the youths of today. I would rather free them so that I will meet a free people; a people that have room to grow. Those are the things I want to meet in the future in 30, 40 years I\u2019m on the throne. I want to look back and say yes, these people have been liberated and they are happy.\n\nIt is going to be a pyramid effect, a domino effect which is going to work on larger population, even people that are not mine; the black race entirely. My own idea of monarchy is that we have to define our position. If my forefathers did not define their positions, I want to define it. Yoruba culture, Yoruba tradition is deeply rooted in the existence of Olodumare (the Supreme Being). It is deeper than what the eyes can see. It is deeper than what you can talk about in the physical. We are so deep that our culture and tradition is the best in the world. We must be free from the myths and superstitions of idolatry and deities which are bastardising our culture. Idolatry and deities are not a culture; they are tradition. It is a religion. The idolaters and deity worshippers want what we call our own existence which we call our culture and tradition, which came from kingship. They want to put it under their own religion.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhat is kingship? It is not about Christian God or Muslim God; it is about one God, Olodumare, the creator of heaven and the earth. When it comes to God, it is not about race, it is not about colour. We have a supreme being that is the creator; that is the king. He is the real king. The Yoruba are the only ones that call their king by the name of God, that is kabiyesi \u2026 ka bi o ko si (you are unquestionable). That is the way they greet their king. No other race in the world greets their king like that. Who is Kabiyesi Olodumare? That is the real kabiyesi. So who are these earthly kings in Yorubaland? They are the representatives of the Almighty Olodumare. They are more than humans when they are elevated from humans and princes to a king.\n\nOlodumare is the one that appoints these kings; it is not by votes. He is the one that will make the king to get there. So when you are a king, you are representing God. Pastors, prophets, alfas, babalawos ( priests) are all messengers. Is a messenger greater than the representative of God? No. So, we are working with our head in Yorubaland. Power must go back to the kings. I\u2019m not telling the olorisa not to worship their orisa, but the kings have the authority of the land in their hands that rules the land. Olodumare told them to represent Him. God is the owner of the land.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe palace is the home of God on earth. So in the home of the Almighty on earth, should we have two kings there? There cannot be two kings in the palace. When there is a deity or idol in the palace, we have two kings. That is why I said kings can have idol worshippers as subjects, but a king must not bow to idol or idol worshippers. In Yorubaland, they call the king the deputy of the deities. Does a deputy have power? It means we are deputy to the deity and idols. Then it means that a king does not have power as long as the orisa is still there, which they want to use our throne to promote. As long as the orisa is still there, it means that kings will never be relevant. Our own father that brought the crown even fought Orisa Obatala. Obatala prostrated and he ruled over Obatala. How can the kings worship idols? The only enemy to the crown is the deities.\n\nThe palace had been in existence before Islam and Christianity. We are the representatives of God on earth and we are put under orisa. Show me any deity Oduduwa worshipped. If they can bring one, then I will remove myself as king.\n\nWhat have been the reactions of your people to this reform in the palace?\n\nSome are falling in line. Many believe that I\u2019m their voice to take kings out of slavery of these olorisa who are just few. They try to use stool to promote their own deities and many kings have now seen that we can get our powers back, if we do away with these deities. How can a king worship deities? Any king that worships deity in Yorubaland can keep on worshipping it. There is no hierarchy, any king that worships deity, I\u2019m bigger than them. You are laughing? That is for real, because we will do it according to the dictate of the real king.\n\nOur subjects say they are better and greater than deity. They don\u2019t reckon with idol worshipping. So if you, a whole king, are a deputy to the deity, you are a slave to the deity. Which one would you prefer: to be a representative of God or a deputy to a deity? To be a representative of the Almighty will bring more respect. Do you know how the Yoruba greet their kings? They lie down and say, \u2018Kabiyesi ooo.\u2019 That is the name of God.\n\nYou are the most reported Yoruba traditional ruler. How do you feel about this?\n\nIt is the definition of monarchy in Yorubaland to be a servant, day and night, to your people. When you serve the people, you are planting a seed of service. The service will grow for you. When you see something wrong in the country and you don\u2019t care whose ox is gored, you said I\u2019m going to make things work; I\u2019m not going to remain silent. Fools will multiply when wise men are silent. So, if you are a wise man and you don\u2019t want fools to multiply in your land, which can even impact your child, you talk. I am a father; you can see my age. I\u2019m a father to this race and I would always act as a father regardless of what you think. Most talk about, most social media friendly; yes the social media is the thing of the moment. Let them shut down instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp, you will see how your life would be. You call me a social king; that means I\u2019m the king of the moment.\n\nYou have fought so many battles, but one way or the other, you have managed to survive. What is the secret?\n\nThe secret is Olodumare, the creator of everything. I hold Him high. It is a king that exalts a king; a king does not exalt orisa. When you start raising God, God will raise you in truth. Not that you say you are praising God and when something happens you are scared. You see a little storm and you shiver. Faith comes from being confident and bold. Confidence and being bold is equal to faith. When you have that absolute faith in the unseen God, the almighty will never forsake you. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do.\n\nYou preside over a community, a town where they believe so much in Islam. In one vein, you said you were not against tradition. But you are against worshipping of idols and idolatry\u2026\n\nI\u2019m against what is bastardising our culture.\n\nWhere do you draw the line? Some of the traditional practices are against Islam\u2026\n\nTell me what is against Islam and Christianity in our tradition?\n\nThe mode of dressing, for example. In Islam, a woman is expected to cover her head, but in our culture, it is not compulsory\n\nAre you talking about culture or are you talking about manners?\n\nWay of life\u2026\n\nWhen you are talking about the way of life of some people, that is what they prefer. Some people prefer that their women should be covered. They don\u2019t want people to see the shape of the body of their wife. I actually like it. I like it when women are covered. They don\u2019t see the shape of my wife. Everybody looks, even if a man is passing, people look. If a woman is passing, people look, not to talk of a woman showing her shape. There are many women who can be a side show, but when you are a wife at home, I think that one should be for your husband. That is my belief. As a way of life, it is good for a married woman to be covered. And if any other person decides not to cover up, that is their own way of life; that is the freedom to dress the way you want. When it comes to my own wife, I think I will like her to cover.\n\nThere is nothing against our culture that is against anyone. The only one I see against our culture and tradition is Olorisa who never made our people wear adire, ofi. They want everybody to wear white. Orisa is against the culture and tradition of the Yoruba people. Orisa promotes their own. If they had their way, they would make everybody wear white in Nigeria. You will never see an olorisa that wears ofi, sanyan, alari coloured dresses. They will tell you to wear white. They themselves don\u2019t understand what they are doing.\n\nEven Ifa tell you to wear white, but it is not telling you to be wearing this white clothes; it is telling you that your inside should be clean and your outside should be clean. Your ways should be clean to man. Deity worshipping is a religion. It is not our culture, and it is not our tradition.\n\nShould I then assume that you appear colorful always because you don\u2019t want to associate with the orisa?\n\nI\u2019m so colourful because it is our identity. I\u2019m so colorful because I\u2019m odidere (a colorful kind of bird) personified. Iwo is odidere and I talk because odidere speaks the truth. I represent the full odidere. Odidere is the only creation of God that speaks apart from humans, nothing else. Odidere is the only one that speaks the truth. And I get the inspiration of the true Yoruba history from Olodumare. When you are a king and you are close to Olodumare, everything will be given to you. You will see things. You will hear from God and you will see what God wants you to see. You don\u2019t need any oloris. You don\u2019t need any babalawo (herbalist). The authority is in you, you only need to say let this land be great and it will be great. You tell your children who are sick to be healed. The God that blesses is the God that takes. The God that gives good health is the God that takes good health. You can even say the bad health that is in you should come and take the king, because I\u2019m not the king, God is the king. I do that with testimonies. You can ask the people that work with me.\n\nAn Oba should bring alleviation of poverty. He should serve his people and make the land grow and develop. A king should be a servant and treat his subject like a king. You should be the best servant to be the best king. I want to be the best king, that is why I want to be the best servant ever.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSometimes you get criticised in the media. When you read such reports, how do they make you feel?\n\nWhen I\u2019m doing the right thing, I see this as ignorance. There was a time, I don\u2019t know, I would criticise people. But since I became a king, God has given me a lot of wisdom to know the right from wrong. When I see those things I ask what about when I didn\u2019t know, I would like to make them known. Common sense is not common, not to talk about special sense. You let them know, you have to let people see what common sense is, you teach them.\n\nWhen I see that, I don\u2019t pay attention to that as long as I\u2019m doing the right thing.\n\nWhat has been your greatest challenge as a traditional ruler?\n\nMy greatest challenge is that I know the work God has given me to do is a lot but I have signed. I want to serve my people. I left Canada. Imagine me leaving Canada as a Canadian holding a Canadian passport, to come and sit in Iwo to come and serve my people. I want to build Iwo just like the fathers of other nations that built their nation. I will stay in Iwo to build Iwo to modern day. I will suffer for it. I will strive for it. I will serve my people. I will make Iwo great by the grace of God, and God is doing it. I\u2019m going to be six years on the throne in November. In six years, there have been tremendous achievements in the history of that land.\n\nYou mentioned your civil war experience in Liberia during the civil war. What was it like?\n\nIt was a real physical war. War of guns, ambushed, bombed. When you see people dead by your side, people you saw one minute before they are dead, your friends, your acquaintances, when you see how bombs split people into two, you see jet fighters blow people\u2019s brains off, you can look at yourself and say it could have been me.\n\nYou are ambushed. In a war there is no wife, there are no children. Even you will leave your children, your wife and run. During war, you don\u2019t change clothes. During war, no kings, no government, no president; the only spirit that is there is the spirit of evil, looting, destroying even when people don\u2019t need to destroy things. Things that they can need they can destroy because it is a kind of different spirit. Children, even the President will become refugees in other countries. People will be looking for food, handouts from the sky.\n\nNobody wants war. I\u2019ve seen death face to face more than eight times. I\u2019ve been shot at. Gun has been put to my head. Gun has been put everywhere. I was taken to where I was to be killed but I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still surviving. War kills, war destroys, war loots, war rapes. War destroys humanity.\n\nI fought war; I became a commander in a war. I know what war is. I survived.\n\nYou said a gun was put to your head. How did you manage to escape?\n\nI survived. It was God. I became a king today because God wants me to see things to be able to experience things. Rags are not riches; they are experienced. May Nigeria not witness any more war. This is why we want peaceful resolution to any problem we have in Nigeria.\n\nWhat do you think should be the role of traditional rulers in this dispensation? It is like the traditional rulers have been relegated\u2026\n\nThe Yoruba traditional rulers have relegated themselves to the second in command to the deities; deities that cannot move. Deities are for the past. You can only reference history, you can\u2019t apply it. Many things have relegated the traditional rulers, especially in the South West. We have to stand up. We have to break the shackles of enslavement we are in. But the Yoruba own is more spiritual; they have offended Olodumare who they represent. They said it was what their fathers were doing. Who do you represent? Who are you working for? If you work for a chairman and you don\u2019t take orders from the chairman, you are fired.\n\nWhy are you complaining that your kings are relegated? You have relegated yourself already and we are trying to take you out of that enslavement. Some of them are fighting it. Some of them are saying it is because it is Oluwo that is saying it. Because I\u2019m the one saying it, you can keep on being in slavery.\n\nYou were once suspended by the Osun State Council of Traditional rulers. Initially you said it was not going to work. At what point did you make a u-turn to listen to the council?\n\nThat was a media charade. Forget it; I\u2019m not going to talk too much about it.\n\nI\u2019m a paramount ruler with over 30 kings being crowned by the Oluwo. I\u2019m not just a paramount ruler; I\u2019m a natural paramount ruler in Yorubaland, one of the crowns since inception in Yorubaland. I\u2019m not a crown that was made by a white man. I\u2019m not a crown that was created by elevation. I was not elevated. I\u2019m a crown from the inception, Oluwo of Oluwo. I was one of the king\u2019s in the Western House of Chiefs. My number is three. Oba S.O. Abimbola, one of my predecessors, was a minister without portfolio in the Western House of Chiefs. How many kings were ministers without portfolios then? We were not more than three.\n\nA powerful stool in Yorubaland is the stool of the Oluwo as a paramount ruler. When it comes to paramountcy, no king has power over me.\n\nMajority of Yoruba Obas are polygamists but you prefer monogamy. What is the reason for that?\n\nIt is not that I prefer monogamy. Polygamy is a cultural thing. It is a way of life for some people. It did not start today. If you check the bible, you will see that Isaac, Jacob, they all had many wives. It is the way of life of some people. Our fathers used to have many wives. But me as a servant of the people, it is not that I prefer monogamy. I have a lot of work to do as the servant of the people, so I will like to stay just with one wife. If I can have the strength and power later, maybe I will take one more. But if you have a lot of work to do outside, you have to rest; you have a lot of work to do inside also. You have to satisfy your wives. But if it is only one, we can still be managing out of love. We serve the community together.\n\nHow much pressure are you getting from your community to marry another wife?\n\nNo pressure, because I\u2019m serving them. That is my personal life. Kingship is different now; you have to be able to serve your people. Getting a wife is a personal thing. I know that they don\u2019t want another wife that will poison me again. A wife that because she is not getting enough money, she wants to poison you, she wants to sell you out to people that contested the stool with you; a wife that wants to take ransom since she came into the palace on contract basis with her handlers.\n\nI didn\u2019t know her from Canada; I knew her from Nigeria. She had handlers who set her up for the palace. Guess what they told her to do? Many things. Since the day she got in, she had been recording. Why would a woman be recording for four years? When I got her and I said this is what you have been doing and she started asking for ransom, threatening that she would release the video to the public, I said go and put it out. If God is the one that put me on this throne, nobody can remove me. Olodumare, God vindicated me.\n\nHow soon are we expecting another queen?\n\nI will take my time. I\u2019m not in a rush. Let everybody go and take it easy. I\u2019m not in a rush. I will take my time; I will have a great wife.",

          "title": "Bishop Mike Okonkwo: Nigeria needs a ruthless leader with a human face",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nThe Presiding Bishop of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), Dr. Mike Okonkwo, has impacted lives as a preacher of the gospel. A one-time seasoned banker with Africa Continental Bank (ACB), he went into church ministry when pastoral work, especially Pentecostalism, was like a joke. But he\u2019s remained focused on his calling for a long time. In fact, for about 40 years since he founded TREM, he has remained relevant and versatile as a preacher. This is evident in the fact that the former President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), and Vice-Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), passionately preaches \u201cPower in the Word\u201d to a multicultural and diverse audience in Nigeria and across the globe even till today. He recently clocked 76. In this interview, he talks about mentorship, what he would like to be remembered for, and the state of the nation.\n\nIn your 76 years of existence, you must have seen a lot. What lessons have you learned about life?\n\nLife is about how much you can be a blessing to others or humanity. At the end of the day, it is what you did to influence other people that will matter. The legacy anyone should be shooting for in life is: who has my life influenced; who have I impacted? It is not about buildings, houses, cars, and all those things. Who can you say that your life has changed? That is what is principal. If the pandemic did not teach anyone a lesson, nothing else will. During the pandemic, I opened my wardrobe and saw dresses. Dresses would be looking at me and I would be looking at them. Before the pandemic, I could go anywhere with them and turn eyes on me. Bu now the shoes are there; you are not going anywhere. The car is grounded because of the pandemic. God is simply saying these things are nothing. What gives me joy? It is the fact that there are people who have benefited from me. It is the fact that you have a need and I\u2019m in a position to help you. And, I did help. The same way I helped you, go and help others. For me, that\u2019s life.\n\nWhat would you want to be remembered for as Bishop Mike Okonkwo?\n\nRemember how much I was able to touch you. Just remember how my life changed your life. That\u2019s all. Not much.\n\nYou have mentored many pastors within and outside Nigeria. Who mentored you in your early days as a preacher? Which men of God have impacted your life over the years?\n\nWhen we came on board, there were very few people who were visible in charismatic and Pentecostal churches. Most of the existing churches were white garment churches. Foursquare Gospel Church and Assemblies of God were the two major churches you could call \u201cliving churches\u201d in those days. Even The Redeemed Christian Church was more of a prayer group. There was nothing like Mountain of Fire. Deeper Life was a ministry, not a church. By the time we came into ministry, we hooked up with Foursquare. I was inviting the founders of the church regularly to our church then in Akoka. Rev. Dr. Boyejo James Abayomi, of blessed memory, was the first General Overseer of Foursquare. I was also in a relationship with Dr. S.O Odunaike, who also was a leader in the church. He is late now. Then those who came subsequently after them like Faroumbi, (he\u2019s also retired) and Rev. Wilson Badejo, also late, we had a good relationship with them. In fact, he served under me as my deputy in the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria. I was in touch with Foursquare; it was a ministry I looked up to in those days. I am talking about the people that I had relationships with. There was also Archbishop Benson Idahosa. Internationally, there was Dr. Morris Cerrullo, who had also gone to be with the Lord. Now, you have leaders of like minds that you should surround yourself with, people of the same apostolic calling. Those who are behind us cannot say they don\u2019t have good examples to follow: people who they can look up to; people who can help to mentor them. I have people I relate with in real terms. They include Pastors Adeboye, Ayo Oritsejafor, Dr. Omobude, the immediate past President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, and Dr. Paul Nwachukwu. These are people who don\u2019t need anything from you. They can tell you where you are wrong without mincing words.\n\nWhat do you think the church can do to have a better Nigeria?\n\nI don\u2019t think I agree with your concept. How about China? Do they worship God? What of Indians who worship thousands and millions of gods? What about Dubai? They are Muslims. Some years ago, Dubai was an ordinary desert. I\u2019m not advocating that we should live a godless life. What I\u2019m trying to say is that what you are saying is not the issue. Rather, it is the re-orientation of the mind. These nations I just mentioned took the principles of the scriptures and applied them and things began to change for better for them. Mind you, many of them are still serving their idols or gods. The truth is, if you apply the Biblical principles to your life, you will get the same result. Where there is no vision the people perish. Thus says the Bible. It didn\u2019t say it\u2019s for Christian or Muslims; it\u2019s for every person. If you have a vision, you will get to your goal. \u201cWhatsoever a man sayest with his mouth\u201d\u2026 you can have what you say. It\u2019s not meant for Christians alone. When people operate on Biblical principles, they get results. Sometimes I read in newspapers about people calling for national repentance. As good as it sounds, that is not our problem. Are we all Christians? Nigeria is not a Christian country but a multi-religious, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic nation. You can\u2019t force people to become Christians. God put them there just as he put Christians, atheists, homosexuals, and lesbians. They are here and you can\u2019t force anyone to be a Christian except he or she wants to. This same God is making the rain fall and the sun shine on both the bad and the good. So, you don\u2019t need to Christianize Nigeria before you can begin to enjoy the goodness of God.\n\nNo. It\u2019s about principle and mindset. Do you have a vision? Do you have a drive? Are you daring? Are you bold in stepping out and getting things done? Those are the things that bring results. So, it\u2019s the mindset. Look at Mandela. After being in incarceration for over 20 years, he could have come out and said, now that I have gotten what I want, I\u2019m not stepping down from power for anybody.\n\nThose are leaders. Our problem is, we don\u2019t have moral leaders, I\u2019m not talking about Christians \u2013 who will say something and stand by it? That is integrity. Kwame Nkrumah said that if the kind of liberty that they are going to give to him will result in the incarceration of others in Africa, putting them in bondage, he does not want it. These are leaders who understand what they are doing.\n\nTalking about the country Nigeria, let me say that the way we are now as a nation, we need a leader who has a ruthless attitude and a human face. If there are things he needs to do whether people like it or not, he should do it.\n\nIf there are people to put in jail, send them to jail. This country is not going to change with kid\u2019s locks. As we speak now, everywhere you turn to in this country is rotten. I used to say this in a joking way. I ask people, is it Buhari the one in the customs? Is he the one collecting duties at the Wharf, and is he the one at the borders? It is Nigerians. Is Buhari the Vice-Chancellor of the University who has refused to take care of the university even though they give them votes to take care of some financial problems? It is the people. How did Rwanda change? Everyone is celebrating the progress that Rwanda has made today. Go and ask what Kigali did to get to the economic position it is now in spite of years of ethnic hostilities.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Funsho Arogundade\n\nRoseline Omokhoa Afije aka Liquorose is the first runner-up and last girl standing of the just concluded Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye season 6.\n\nPrior to her selection as a housemate, the 26-year-old professional dancer, who started her dancing career at the age of 12, claimed to have different personality traits. She went into the show to display all of it and came an inch closer to winning the big prize.\n\nIn this chat, the Edo State-born Liquorose narrates her experience while in the house and what she has in stock as a new reality show star.\n\nHow do you feel coming close to winning the Big Brother Naija\u2019s N90 million big prize?\n\nTo be honest with you, it\u2019s still shocking to me that I emerged as the first runner-up. It\u2019s overwhelming and I didn\u2019t see it coming. I actually imagined myself being in the finals but I didn\u2019t really believe I would emerge the first runner-up. The first runner-up? It was shocking! Days after, I kept asking myself if I was actually on stage with the eventual winner. Till date, I still find it shocking, walking straight from the house with the eventual winner, White Money to that stage as the first runner-up of Big Brother. I was just overwhelmed.\n\nYou had a huge fan base before going into the BBNaija house unlike some other housemates that were rarely known. Is it that you didn\u2019t go in expecting to win the competition?\n\nNot really. Of course, I wasn\u2019t aware who my fellow housemates would be. I only got to meet them when I entered the house. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t thinking of my fan base as an advantage. In fact, I was actually scared of what those fans and others outside would say or feel about me. Big Brother is a massive reality television show and one has to be 100 per cent real and entertaining. It\u2019s not about having a large fan base outside but giving people what they want to see about you. So, I went in and was just hoping and praying to God to see me through.\n\nWhile in the house, you turned out to be a bundle of energy and almost hyperactive\u2026\n\nBig Brother Naija is a huge platform where everyone wants to go to showcase their talents. It\u2019s a platform where you have to be real and entertaining. For me, as a dancer, I really love to dance and act as well. So, I saw an opportunity to exhibit other talents the world was yet to discover about me. So, Big Brother provided that platform I had always wanted, and since finally I was there, why can\u2019t I pour out everything?\n\nWhat was the most fulfilling part of being a housemate of BBNaija?\n\nThere were two instances: when I won the Head of House as the third female in the season, and also when I won a task involving a basketball game. For me, it was a big deal and exciting because prior to that, I didn\u2019t know how to play basketball. Even the guys were enthralled and were asking me how I managed to pull that.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for Liquorose?\n\nThere is a lot in the kitty. I have actually been reached out to by a couple of talent managers, but I am taking my time in making decision.\n\nAs a new reality TV star and entertainer, what experience are you looking forward to pushing out now?\n\nBefore I went into the house, there were so many things I wanted to do but I didn\u2019t have a platform to showcase them. Now that Big Brother has given me the needed exposure and push, I think I am ready to go. I would like to do music and movies. I am a writer and content creator. Before Big Brother Naija, I had written scripts for short films; I had recorded some content for my dance crew, Girls Got Bold (GGB) and I am already working on a book. I also write songs and have written quite a number of poems. So, I am looking forward to releasing my collection of poems as well as showcasing my singing talent.\n\nTell us more about your book?\n\nI have always wanted to write books that will look into my family background, my life experience as well as imaginative and fictional stuff. I actually haven\u2019t completed any but while I was in isolation, I started writing a book and already finished two chapters. Now that I am out, I am going to work at concluding it and share it with the world.\n\nNow that you are a star, what would become of your crew, GGB?\n\nThey supported me 100 per cent while in the house and even now. So, my new status is not going to affect Liquorose nor GGB, rather it\u2019s going to be of positive influence. For now, we are going to be bigger. Those are my sisters and they are my partners. We are sisters for life. We are always together. So, it\u2019s not going to affect my crew in any way. We have the same goal, same ambition and achievement. So, this is just like the beginning of what my crew and I are about to show to the world. I am going to try as much as possible to create the balance because GGB is me and I am GGB. Liquorose and Girls Got Bold, we are one. We are going to create a balance.\n\nSince you came out of the BBNaija house, what would you say has been the most shocking part of your newfound fame?\n\nThere are lots, but what I find most shocking now is that, even if I cough, it spreads everywhere. At the same time, the love has been massive. I was in Kano last week, the love, support and energy for Liquorose was overwhelming. I saw men and women coming to me, and I was so humbled.\n\nHas that put any pressure on you?\n\nNo pressure at all. The energy has been so positive and exciting for me. But it comes to me like: is this for real? Prior to going into the house, I had been there but not as big as I am now. I already have an idea or experience of what a celebrity life could be. So, nothing is going to change me negatively.\n\nNow, how do you intend to sustain the momentum?\n\nI am a born entertainer, an all-round entertainer. As a combination of talent, people should expect more from me in the area of entertainment, arts and business. I am fully ready to keep the energy so that the whole love can be so enduring.\n\nWhen would real love and relationship come into your plans?\n\nLet\u2019s see how it goes but I am open! I am presently in a good place and taking my time before getting involved in any love or relationship. I really want to be focused now on achieving my different goals and ambitions.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "title": "In Landmark Move, Cambridge Returns Benin Bronze Cockerel",
          "text": "*Legendary Okukor to arrive Nigeria October 27\n\nCharles Ajunwa\n\nJesus College, University of Cambridge, England yesterday announced that it would hand over a Benin bronze cockerel, Okukor, to a Nigerian delegation on October 27, in a gesture Nigerian officials said \u201coffered hope for amicable resolutions\u201d of the ongoing disputes over the ownership of its cultural properties.\n\nThe Okukor, described by the college as a \u201croyal ancestral heirloom,\u201d was taken from the Benin Kingdom during a punitive expedition in 1897, when thousands of bronzes were looted by British forces.\n\nIt will be the first stolen artefact to be returned and this is expected to spark a wave of repatriation ceremonies, as the cultural world continues to reckon with concerns over the ethics of plundered historical artefacts.\n\nJesus College, the first British institution to return one of the stolen bronzes, in what it described as \u201ca historic moment\u201d, said officials of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments will formally collect the Bronze in its College on October 27.\n\n\u201cDelegates from the Commission and Benin will visit the College for a ceremony to complete the handover process and celebrate the rightful return of the Bronze,\u201d said the college.\n\nMs Sonita Alleyne, OBE, Master of Jesus College, said: \u201cThis is an historic moment. We look forward to welcoming representatives from Nigeria and Benin to the handover ceremony and to celebrating the return of this Bronze.\n\n\u201cThis is the right thing to do out of respect for the unique heritage and history of this artefact.\n\n\u201cSince we took the decision to return the Bronze, following the College\u2019s Legacy of Slavery Working Party\u2019s (LSWP) extensive research, many organisations have followed in our footsteps. I would like to thank the LSWP for its diligent and careful investigation into the provenance of the Bronze, to the Fellows for their keen support for its restitution, and to our students who pioneered calls for this.\u201d\n\nIn a message to the college, His Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin, Ewuare II expressed his delight at the return of the artefact which he described as important to the religious beliefs of the Benin people.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are indeed very pleased and commend Jesus College for taking this lead in making restitution for the plunder that occurred in Benin in 1897.\n\n\u201cWe truly hope that others will expedite the return of our artworks which in many cases are of religious importance to us. We wish to thank our President Buhari and our National Commission for Museums and Monuments for their renewed efforts in securing the release of our artefacts on our behalf.\n\n\u201cFinally, we wish to thank the student body of Cambridge University for bringing to light the historical significance of this revered piece of the Royal Court of Benin. It is worthy of note that our father attended Cambridge University but was then Prince Solomon Akenzua. He later ascended the throne of our forefathers as Omo N\u2019Oba Erediauwa, Oba of Benin.\u201d\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed and the Director-General, NCMM, Professor Abba Isa Tijani, expressed gratitude to Jesus College for setting the pace in the return of the artefacts.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cWe thank Jesus College for being a trailblazer and we look forward to a similar return of our artefacts by other institutions that are in possession of them.\u201d\n\nTijani added: \u201cThis return offers new hope for amicable resolution in cultural property ownership disputes. We hope that it will set a precedent for others around the world that are still doubtful of this new evolving approach whereby nations and institutions agree with source nations on return without rancor.\n\n\u201cOn our part, the National Commission for Museums and Monuments is receiving this antiquity for the benefit of the Benin people and the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Okukor was removed from public display at the college following calls from students for it to be sent back in 2016.\n\nIn May 2019, Jesus College set up its Legacy of Slavery Working Party \u2013 comprising Fellows, staff and student representatives \u2013 to explore the historical, legal and moral status of the College\u2019s ownership of the Bronze. They examined evidence showing that the statue was looted directly from the Court of Benin, as part of the punitive British expedition of 1897, and was given to the College in 1905 by the father of a student.\n\nAfter Jesus College announced its decision to return the bronze in November 2019, a host of regional museums committed to or said they were also considering returning artefacts.\n\nThe UK retains hundreds of Benin bronzes \u2013 plaques and sculptures \u2013 dating to the 13th century, made by artisans from the Edo culture. They were distributed from private collections and in some cases donated by soldiers who took part in the 1897 looting. Historically, much of the focus has been on the British Museum, which holds 900 objects \u2013 the largest collection in the world.\n\nThe campaign to repatriate Benin bronzes gained momentum when Bernie Grant, one of Britain\u2019s first black MPs, made vigorous appeals in the 1990s for their return. But it has been a contentious debate that has recently become embroiled in culture war clashes.\n\nEarlier this year, the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, objected to \u201cthe removal of statues or other similar objects\u201d and urged museums to \u201cdefend our culture and history from the noisy minority of activists constantly trying to do Britain down.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Parallel assemblies likely in 13 states\n\n*Fence-mending maneuvers crumble\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nWith the dusts raised by the local government congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yet to settle, the party is today going ahead with its state congresses, to elect officials for these levels of its structures.\n\nThe scenario of the local government congresses, characterised by protests, boycotts, and the election of parallel executives by the different factions in many states, looks set to repeat itself across the country.\n\nParallel congresses are likely in at least 13 states in spite of the various fence-mending sorties carried out by the various committees vested with that duty.\n\nThe parallel assemblies would flow from what transpired during the local government congresses where sharp divisions existed, with various factions foughting for the control of the party and structures.\n\nThough Zamfara and Anambra states will not be participating in today\u2019s exercise, Abia, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Adamawa, Lagos, Imo, Enugu, Sokoto, Kano and Katsina are expected to hold parallel congresses.\n\nAbia State\n\nDuring the Ward and Local Government congresses in Abia State, parallel congresses between the factions loyal to the state Chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa and Chief Ikechi Emenike were held. The same drama is expected to play out today. Barely 24 hours to commencement of the congress, elders of the party declared that no state congress would hold in Abia today.\n\nAPC caucus leader in Abia State, Senator Nkechi Nwogu, Chief Sam Nkire, Ume Kanu, Mr. KC Ugboajah and Hon. Elton Onwu and Mr. Chijioke Ikpo called the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to recall the state congress committee sent to Abia State.\n\nAddressing journalists yesterday in Abuja on behalf of the elders, Chris Adighije said any attempt to hold the congress in the state would create problem, confusion and plunge Abia into further crisis.\n\nDelta State\n\nDespite the High Court order restraining the conduct of the last local government congresses in Delta State, a faction of the party led by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, organised the exercise which he described as peaceful.\n\nThereafter, Delta State APC Leaders\u2019 Council called on the National Caretaker Committee to annul the Ward and Local government congresses and organise fresh, all-inclusive congresses.\n\nThe council stated in a communiqu\u00e9, jointly signed by 19 party members including the Chairman of the Council and Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo, Dr. Alex Ideh, the Co-Chairman, the Council Secretary and former Executive Director of NDDC, Cairo Ojougboh and APC\u2019s Governorship Candidate in 2019 in Delta State, Chief Great Ogboru, among others, that they were not satisfied with the manner of the exercise.\n\nWith the spat unresolved till date, it is doubtful if it will be a one house today devoid of boycotts.\n\nAkwa Ibom\n\nThe National Secretary of the APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio will also renew their rivalry in the state today.\n\nWhile Akpanudoedehe controls the state chapter of the party, being an older member of the party, Akpabio is fighting to get hold of the party\u2019s structure in the state.\n\nThe supremacy battle between the two led to the holding of parallel congresses in the 31 LGAs of the state during the local government congresses. The same is expected to be repeated today, as both factions are still in the contest of who blinks first, as issues in contention between the two gladiators are still fresh and potent.\n\nEnugu\n\nThe situation is not different in Enugu State where former Senate President, Ken Nnamani and the state Caretaker Committee Chairman, Ben Nwoye are locked in opposing sides and striding for control of the soul if the party and none of them has agreed to loosen their grip.\n\nThe local government congresses produced different leadership structures in all 17 council areas of the state due to failure to resolve contending issues. It is also expected that a parallel state congresses will hold today.\n\nOgun\n\nThe Supremacy battle between the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun will be renewed today. There has been no love lost between the two political leaders.\n\nThe Chairman of the Congress Committee for Ogun State, Wale Ohu fears there would be parallel congresses and voiced that much when he said he was inundated with inquiries on how things would go today.\n\nThe indication that another congress by a faction was in the offing was when he said, \u201cI have the mandate of the National Secretariat of the party to vet, screen and conduct the Ogun State congress of the APC. No other election is valid, except the one by my committee of seven sent by the National headquarters of the party.\u201d\n\nOsun\n\nOsun is going to be another battle ground today, especially between Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola and the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola with each of them pulling the strings.\n\nDuring the local government congresses, members of the APC who belong to The Osun Progressives (TOP), a political movement loyal to Aregbesola held their congress at Comrade Ola-Oni Centre in Osogbo, while those who belong to the Ileri Oluwa group \u2013 the political movement of the governor held theirs at the Osogbo Federal Constituency office.\n\nLagos\n\nDespite Lagos being the home state of the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, the party has been factionalised as far back as 2018.\n\nThe two APC factions in Lagos State are the Tunde Balogun-led group and the Lagos4Lagos group. Like it happened during the local government congresses where parallel congress were held across the state, similar scenario is expected to take place today. In fact, the situation was so tense that unconfirmed reports said State Executives expected to be elected today were announced yesterday evening even ahead of the exercise.\n\nRivers\n\nIn Rivers State, there are two factions of the party. One is led by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi while the order is led by Senator Magnus Abe.\n\nDuring the local government congresses, Amaechi\u2019s faction participated, while Abe\u2019s faction boycotted the exercise. The story is not expected to be different today. It is either going to be a boycotted congress or a parallel one\n\nKwara\n\nIn Kwara, the faction loyal to the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed has been having a running battle with the faction loyal to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\n\nThe faction loyal to Mohammed recently opened a parallel party secretariat in the state. During the local government congresses, the two factions held separate congresses.\n\nSokoto\n\nSokoto State chapter of the APC is set to hold parallel congresses.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the factional leader in the state, Dr. Balarabe Salame said like the wards and local governments congresses, his group had arranged for a state congress today.\n\nSalame, who is a former acting Governor and current member representing Illela/Gwadawa Federal constituency, lamented his group bought forms but were not contacted on when and the mode of Congress.\n\nSalame accused the leader of the party in the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko of creating factions in the party to achieve his political aim.\n\nImo\n\nThe fight between former governor Rochas Okorocha and incumbent Governor Hope Uzodinma appears unabated, as well as Ifeanyi Ararume who boycotted party activities. But it is no longer clear if he will still be in the trenches as he has been appointed Chairman, Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.\n\nHowever, there is still no love lost between Uzodinma and Okorocha. No matter how it pans, the exercise will either be boycotted by one faction or a parallel congress will result.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Canvasses electronic voting for future polls\n\n*Says debate on power rotation fuelled by political immaturity\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church (CGCC), Pastor Tunde Bakare yesterday canvassed for electronic voting in future polls in the country, while also not ruling out the possibility of running for President come 2023, \u201cif it is the desire of God with the support of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe also declared that the controversy over rotational presidency was being fueled by political immaturity, saying the debate ought to have centred on the capacity and character of whoever would be allowed to lead the country.\n\nBakare, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, was asked if he would be running for the office of the President in 2023, and he said: \u201cEvery Nigerian, who is of age and who is not disqualified by any means, is free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a nation builder, if God wants me to do that, and the people of Nigeria will appreciate that, why not? I\u2019m as free as anybody to do anything with my time. I\u2019ve pastored a church for 33 years, now we raise new leaders. I want to focus on nation building.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the President is only one office, there\u2019re so many other things we can do as people to support whoever is there to make sure that we do not go into retrogression, but begin to make steady progress as a people. I\u2019ve already communicated clearly, my future plans to Mr. President, and it stays between us.\u201d\n\nOn rotational presidency, Bakare said: \u201cIt\u2019s our immaturity, politically and otherwise, that makes us say power must either be in the North or be in the South, instead of looking for the best, the fittest, the most competent, and people of character, who love this nation.\n\n\u201cListen to me, if where the president comes from will make the place he comes from to be better, the Northern part of Nigeria should be richest and should be the most progressive and the most developed because out of 61 years, the north has produced either the president or heads of state for 40 to 41 years and yet, see the retrogression in the North.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s from the South, why should a person like President Obasanjo freeze and seize the account of Lagos State in his own tenure? If it\u2019s from South-South or South-east, why couldn\u2019t President Jonathan use all his powers to develop South-South/South-east?\n\n\u201cNot where they come from, it\u2019s what they carry and what they have to offer. May the best of the best of Nigerians rise, regardless of whether they\u2019re from the east, or from the west, or from the north, or from the south.\n\n\u201cIf there are agreements among politicians on rotation, a bargain is a bargain. That\u2019s between them. But as far as this country is concerned, what we need at this stage is a man who can drive us to the Eldorado.\u201d\n\nBakare also advised the National Assembly to better its record of quality legislation by working to achieve electronic voting in future polls nationwide.\n\nHe commended the National Assembly for approving electronic transmission of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), describing it as one of the best things the federal legislature had so far done.\n\nOn the recent approval for electronic transmission of election results by the National Assembly, he said: \u201cPerhaps, that is one of the best things the present National Assembly has done, especially the Senate, because with that, Nigerians can vote and then results can be transmitted so easily. Not only that, part of the state of the nation address that I did on October 10, I emphasised how Nigerian youth, especially undergraduates, are disenfranchised in our country.\n\n\u201c22.3 million students are registered, but during election, campuses are shut, they will not be able to return there to vote, therefore disenfranchised. If we can do not just transmitting results, but to be able to vote electronically, that will be wonderful. It will deepen and enhance our democracy.\n\nBakare, who ran in 2011 on the same Presidential ticket as President Buhari, also said his call for restructuring of the country did not involve balkanisation, but explained that a peaceful restructuring is possible, when justice, equity and the rule of law are allowed to take hold.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cI\u2019d said it, it\u2019s in the open, the documents are already there. It\u2019s not something I can cover in five minutes. We can do it without shooting any gun. The lecture after lecture after lecture, I have prepared and I\u2019ve made copies available to Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it, to move this nation forward. The founding fathers of this nation; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, alongside with their entourage, in Lancaster House and everywhere, agreed on what type of government Nigeria should have. We must not change the goalpost in the midst of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better off together as a nation than going our different ways. But it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and rule of law.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa currently operates in a hybrid co-living and remote work environment. About half of the team live on the same premises, and once every month, we take a trip to the market to stock up on food items. Almost without fail, we discover that the prices of foodstuffs have increased since our last visit. Often, we complain, but because we have to eat, we pay for the products.\n\nRising food prices have become commonplace in Nigeria in recent years. However, not every Nigerian can be like those of us who grumble yet pay. For most people, even the slightest increase in food prices could be the difference between sending their kids to bed hungry and having just enough to eat.\n\nI tried painting a picture of what food inflation looks like, but this tweet about the increase in the price of sardines does a pretty good job.\n\nI just bought sardine at \u20a6675.\n\n\n\nIt was around \u20a6600 two weeks ago,\n\n\n\nand \u20a6300 early this year. Advertisement September 23, 2021\n\nWorld Food Day is observed annually on October 16 to draw attention to issues surrounding food supply, production, distribution, nutrition, and starvation, among other challenges. To commemorate this year\u2019s celebrations, we look at issues that affect food production and supply in Nigeria, highlighting the work of two agritech startups.\n\nIn addition, we spotlight the effects of food inflation and steps Nigeria can take to meet its food requirements but first, what is food inflation and what causes it?\n\nCauses of food inflation\n\nFood inflation refers to a situation where the prices of food items keep increasing. When this happens, consumers have to spend more to get the same goods they got at different prices in the past. Demand outstripping supply and supply being affected are the two major causes of food inflation. In Nigeria, the second reason is often the reason for the increase in food prices.\n\nWhile writing this article, I took a trip to the local market where I spoke to the traders to understand why food prices are constantly increasing. Surprisingly, most traders were clueless. Nonetheless, they did provide some insights.\n\nThe first trader, who identified herself as Mama Imole (Imole\u2019s mother), could not categorically state why the prices of food items were constantly increasing. She, however, offered an explanation \u2013 the agricultural inputs needed by farmers, such as pesticides and fertilisers, had become more expensive. It, therefore, makes sense that they increase the prices of their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of fish\n\nAnother factor that affects the price of food is infrastructure, of which transportation is a major component. There is no fixed cost for transporting goods in Nigeria as the state of the roads often varies in different parts of the country. An increase in fuel/diesel costs could also affect prices. To recoup their losses, farmers/traders often pass these added costs down to the final consumer.\n\nInsecurity is another factor that affects food prices in Nigeria. Since 2002, the Northern part of Nigeria has been plagued by activities of the dreaded Boko Haram. In recent years, the herdsmen crisis has taken centre stage, further complicating an already disturbing situation.\n\nConsequently, farmers in the North can\u2019t go to their farms. For a country that imports a significant part of the food it consumes, any disruption of local production adversely affects the price of food items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEffects of food inflation\n\nEveryone feels the effects of food inflation but at different levels, from the mother who has to decide what to leave out while grocery shopping to the trader who has to sell almost twice as much to meet previous sales targets; there really is no winner.\n\nMama Imole believes that increasing food prices present a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Traders can\u2019t sell as much as before because consumers\u2019 reduced purchasing power means they do not buy as much as they once did.\n\nMrs Adeniji, another trader, shares the same opinion. Since no farmer can produce all the food items their family needs, they buy what they need from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more significant effect is one that Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of agritech startup, Releaf, points out. With Nigerians spending almost 60% of their income on food, he argues that it is more difficult for them to invest in themselves.\n\n\u201cThe impact on society is that people are unable to invest in themselves. So, on average, Nigerians spend 60% of their income on food, which only leaves the other 40% to invest in their education, health, passion, etc.\n\nSo if we want to create a world where Nigerians can reach their full potential, we have to create a world where Nigerians can decrease the portion of their income spent on essentials like food.\u201d\n\nTo put things in context, consumers in the US spent about 8.6% of their income on food in 2020, freeing up 91.4% for use in other aspects of their life.\n\nThe role of agritech startups in tackling food inflation\n\nLike other areas of the Nigerian economy, tech and tech-enabled startups have sprung up to solve the problem of food inflation. One such startup is Releaf. Currently playing in the palm kernel oil processing space, the startup purchases palm kernels from its network of over 3,000 smallholder farmers.\n\nThe startup developed Kraken \u2013 its proprietary technology \u2013 which it uses to crush palm kernels to produce palm kernel oil for its industrial clients.\n\nInfrastructural challenges dog the average entrepreneur, and logistics for agricultural products are a major challenge. Bad roads and insecurity add to the cost of transporting agricultural produce from the rural areas, where most of the production is done, to factories or markets.\n\nTo solve this problem, Releaf employs a decentralised approach when situating its factories. Rather than build factories in Nigeria\u2019s major cities, they site factories close to the farmers, thus reducing logistics costs and ensuring they pay farmers adequately for their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nFinancing is another issue that farmers face, one which Releaf tries to solve. In June 2021, the startup announced a partnership with OnePipe to offer digital financial services to the farmers in their network.\n\nAnother agritech startup doing great work in the space is Agricorp, a company that produces, processes, and exports spices. This month, it completed a $17.5 million Series A funding round with which it plans to expand its production capacity to 7,000 metric tonnes per annum.\n\nSince its November 2018 launch, the startup has reportedly supported over 5,000 smallholder farmers with inputs and training on agricultural best practices. Using its proprietary technology, Farmbase, the startup aggregates, registers, and pays farmers for products sold.\n\nCrop2Cash is another startup solving problems in the agricultural value chain. One way it does this is by providing financing for smallholder farmers, most of whom are financially excluded. The startup also provides them with agricultural inputs and options to receive payments digitally.\n\nA plan for food security\n\nAs the cost of food rises in Nigeria, it is clear that something must be done, and quickly too. Data from Statista shows that food insecurity increased steadily from 6.6% between 2014 and 2016 to 21.4% between 2018 and 2020. In plain terms, the number of Nigerians who go days without food has increased.\n\nWhile agritech startups are doing a great job, more needs to be done if Nigeria is to feed its growing population. The most obvious is a massive investment in infrastructure to aid the transportation of produce. Moody\u2019s estimates that Nigeria needs to spend $3 trillion over the next 30 years to fix her infrastructure deficit.\n\nGiven that figure is over 20 times Nigeria\u2019s annual budget, other means of funding infrastructure must be explored, including public-private partnerships.\n\nIn addition to fixing infrastructure, effectively fighting insecurity would ensure that more farmers can return to their farms.\n\nFood is a basic necessity, and a hungry nation can have devastating effects on the economy and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office suddenly felt much colder as the young man took in the departmental officer\u2019s words. His dream of being one of the foremost robotic engineers at a top university in the Francophone world seemed to have ended before it even began as he encountered an unexpected problem.\n\nHe had told everyone who cared to listen in Cameroon that he was going to the prestigious Toulouse III University \u2013 Paul Sabatier in France to study, and he had gathered enough resources to make it happen. After a tense five-hour flight and barely enough rest the previous night, he didn\u2019t understand what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, to be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t pay with cash Monsieur,\u201d the officer responded, \u201cYou have to deposit at the bank and make the payment electronically with your card.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling hopeful once more, he thanked the officer. He darted out of the office, making a beeline for the nearest bank, where he excitedly informed the cashier of his intentions and received another shocker.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a school certificate to open a student bank account and get a card.\u201d\n\nThe young man was at his wit\u2019s end. He couldn\u2019t register for his student certificate without paying with a bank card, which he couldn\u2019t get without his student certificate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault that he went to France with cash to pay his registration fees and tuition. After all, he\u2019d left French-speaking Africa, where barely 20% of the population had access to banking services, so that was the obvious option.\n\nThe young man in this story is Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, a neobank looking to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa. PaySika has just raised $350,000 pre-seed from Angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria to fund this mission.\n\nAlongside Stezen Bisselou-Nzengue, Co-founder and CEO, Nengwe is building PaySika on Francophone Africa\u2019s existing mobile money infrastructure. It offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on their favourite messaging apps. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nIts chatbot helps users open an account, request free physical and virtual debit cards, and make transfers with these messaging apps without having to download the PaySika app or use its website.\n\nWhile the registration requirements for neobanks in Nigeria, for example, implicitly require you to have a bank account already, PaySika requires the phone number associated with the widely used mobile money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission has given him the confidence of investors like Charles Edouard Bou\u00e9e (former CEO of Roland Berger), Benjamin Chemla (founder of Stuart), and several others.\n\nNengwe\u2019s Toulouse experience was four years ago, in 2017, before he and his co-founder knew how to build chatbots and financial services applications.\n\nAs he sat in the bank, not knowing what to do next, a sandy-haired middle-aged man with what looked like a never-ending smile walked into the bank with deliberately measured steps.\n\nLooking around and waving at some familiar faces, he spotted Nengwe, whose hands covered his face as he tried to calm himself down.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Nengwe as he got within earshot, his perpetual smile still in place masking his seriousness.\n\nNengwe glanced at him, unsure if trusting a stranger in a foreign country was his best move.\n\nRealising he didn\u2019t have much choice, Nengwe explained his situation as calmly as he could.\n\nWhat followed was the stuff of dreams, the kind Nengwe had before leaving Cameroon.\n\nThis stranger offered to pay his fees with his card and collect cash. Probably more surprising was the man\u2019s seeming familiarity with his story.\n\nThis man turned out to be one of Nengwe\u2019s professors at Upssitech, in Toulouse University.\n\nThis gut-wrenching episode was pretty much par for the course for Africans migrating to study in France. Bisselou-Nzengue, with whom he would later form a close bond, also had a similar experience after leaving his home country of Gabon.\n\n\u201cLater on, I helped some people by providing them with my card and had them give me cash back,\u201d Nengwe reveals.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick to state that this is not the case for students from Germany or even Asia; it happens to just people coming from Africa.\n\nA seed had been sown, albeit in unpleasant circumstances, and both men would begin thinking of ways to solve this problem, which they figured needed to be tackled at the roots. It was clear that they had to democratise access to cards and digital payments services in countries like Cameroon where, only 34% of its adults have a bank account, DR Congo (25%), and Gabon (58.5%), to mention a few.\n\nBuilding that first MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika\n\nAfter graduating in 2019, he quickly decided that working for a company was not for him and began to put his knowledge to good use, testing some of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI started my first company, MyMoney, a chatbot that connected to users\u2019 bank accounts and sent notifications. But it failed because of product-market fit. We started working on PaySika right after,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nBeing one of the most regulated globally, Africa\u2019s financial services sector is not kind to newbie fintechs with no track record, so building PaySika wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.\n\nExpectedly, the inexperienced entrepreneurs were in dire need of cash to build PaySika\u2019s first MVP.\n\n\u201cWe entered French Tech Tremplin, a startup competition organised by the French government to invest in high impact startups. We received $23,000 that helped us in part to build the MVP at the beginning. This plus friends and family, and our own savings, of course,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nAfrica might have a distinct lack of senior developers, and local startups struggle to keep them, but PaySika is rapidly securing the goodwill of talented senior developers who experienced similar problems when moving to Europe.\n\nNengwe also reveals that while fundraising, he and his co-founder surrounded themselves with investors who understand the fintech and banking spaces.\n\n\u201cI would say we were lucky because we were able to get an amazing network of business people that really helped us understand how this startup business works.\n\n\u201cWe have investors with a background in banking infrastructure. We have some who are CTOs, and some who are really good at hiring. We just surrounded ourselves with people who are knowledgeable about key topics that affect us.\u201d\n\nA fully-locked MVP gives Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue the confidence to look for mature angel investors. Some of whom would later join its just-concluded round. But despite this funding, a mammoth-sized issue remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe financial sector in francophone Africa is heavily regulated. So we started scouring through all the details and regulatory requirements. We then partnered with some financial institutions that will help us implement what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2020, Bisselou-Nzengue, COO of PaySika, decided to hone his business skills to complement his technical background. He made the necessary preparations and left for Grenoble Business School in France for a year-long MBA in international business.\n\nThe new business he\u2019s building with Nengwe needs refining, but they seem to be headed in a promising direction.\n\nWith free physical and virtual debit cards and a 1% transaction fee on transfers, the startup does not look like it will be making much money. Nonetheless, Nengwe believes they are taking baby steps.\n\nThough the startup is yet to launch fully, it already has over 20,000 pre-registrations, mainly (90%) made up of young people aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThis was gotten organically. We didn\u2019t do any sort of aggressive marketing to get people onboard. Just referrals from different people who are excited about what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThe future is within reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNengwe says he wants to make the PaySika customer onboarding process seamless enough to cater to people without mobile money accounts. Once it can get its banking licence, it plans to add a savings account service, which he believes would be a major cash cow.\n\n\u201cWe will innovate in the offline space, so our customers can also perform transactions offline. But definitely not USSD. We\u2019re also planning to hire more experienced developers and build a marketing team.\u201d\n\nPaySika has some interesting counterparts in Francophone Africa. Ivory Coast\u2019s Djamo is building a financial super app, and Julaya wants to help businesses reach the unbanked. Wave, a mobile money service provider, became the region\u2019s first Unicorn in September 2021.\n\nAs recently as last year, it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much attention being paid to French-speaking Africa, but that seems to be changing.\n\nFor Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue, their story with PaySika is just beginning, and we\u2019ll leave several blank pages to document what promises to be an interesting journey.\n\n*The conversations and narrative may not have happened exactly the way we told it. But everything was based on facts supplied by PaySika Co-founder, Roger Nengwe, and our research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nPrince Gboyega Famodun and Hon. Rasaq Salinsile have emerged chairmen of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Osun State, as party members today, held parallel congresses.\n\nWhile Hon. Salinsile was elected chairman in the Congress organised by The Osun Progressives (TOP), a faction within the party loyal to former governor of the state and current minister of interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Prince Famodun was elected chairman by faction led by the incumbent governor of the state, Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe TOP Congress, which was almost disrupted by hoodlums who stormed the venue and started shooting sporadically, but were repelled by security operatives who engaged them in gun battle, equally saw the emergence a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Adelani Baderinwa, as State Secretary.\n\nMeanwhile, Famodun got a second term of four years as chairman of the party in the state, the Oyetola faction being the officially recognized leadership of the party in the state.\n\nMr. Tajudeen Lawal, the current state commissioner for Home Affairs also emerged as the Party\u2019s Deputy Chairman, while Alhaja Kudirat Fakokunde returned as the leader of the Women Wing.\n\nAlso 35-year old Akinwemimo Adegoke emerged as the Youth Leader of the party just as Mr. Alao Kamar Olabisi emerged as the secretary.\n\nGovernor Oyetola while speaking during the congress held at Osogbo township stadium, charged the party executives in the state to ensure a reconciliatory process that will guarantee the unity and strength that the Party is known for.\n\nAnnouncing the results of the Congress, the Chairman of the National Committee on the Osun State Congress, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, said the Congress was done in line with the principles and guidelines of the Party.\n\nHe appealed to sympathisers who were not allowed into the venue of the Congress to demonstrate understanding, explaining that only delegates were allowed in the venue because the event was a Congress and not a rally.\n\nElegbeleye, who read out Article 20 of the Party\u2019s Constitution to the delegates, also announced that voice vote was adopted because of the population of the accredited delegates, which totalled 1,840.\n\n\u201cI wish to start by referring our delegates and party leaders to Article 20 (Elections and Appointment) of the APC Constitution. I want to read it out: \u2018All party posts prescribed or implied by this Constitution shall be filled by democratically conducted elections at the respective National Convention or Congress, subject, where possible, to Concensus, provided that where a candidate has emerged by concensus for an elective position, a vote of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 by ballot or voice shall be called, to ensure that it was not an imposition which could breed discontent or crisis,\u201d Elegbeleye read.\n\nOyetola, while addressing Party Delegates after the Congress, reiterated his commitment to a vibrant and rock-solid All Progressives Congress in Osun, calling on all stakeholders to follow suit.\n\nHe congratulated the new executives, charging them to rise to the occasion by promptly mending broken walls and building collapsed bridges for the greater good of the Party and, by extension, the State.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the newly- elected executives of our Party. I urge you to discharge your responsibility with the fear of God and ensure you carry everyone along in the running of the affairs of the party. Let us have a vibrant party that can compete anywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cI thank the team from Abuja for accepting to serve the Party by coming down to Osun to conduct, monitor and supervise the State Congress.\n\n\u201cI thank party leaders and stakeholders for their support and understanding so far and for contributing to the hitch-free exercise.\n\n\u201cI thank members for your understanding and cooperation with the Government. I appeal to you to extend same to the newly-elected party officials. I appeal to those who lost out not to lose hope. I assure you all of a better tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe All Progressives Congress emerged on the strength of unity and progressive ideals. We are still committed to these ideals regardless of some of narratives making the rounds out there.\n\n\u201cI urge the newly-elected executives to ensure reconciliatory process. We cannot rule out the fact that some members are aggrieved for one or more reasons, but this is nothing out of proportion. We remain one united family, and we remain focused on delivering unprecedented progress and development to Osun\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nIn his acceptance remark, the State Party Chairman-elect, Prince Famodun, lauded the Congress as impressive, well-organised and peaceful.\n\nHe called on Party members and stakeholders to channel the same energy and unity towards the primaries in February 2022 and the governorship election scheduled for July 2022.\n\n\u201cWe trust God that this Party will remain strong and indivisible. We appeal to our family members who are aggrieved and out there to return home. The Governor has extended the olive branch.\n\n\u201cIt is on this basis that I also extend an olive branch to the members of our political family who are disenchanted to bury the hatchet in order to collectively work for the re-election of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola during next year\u2019s governorship election. Let\u2019s join hands together and perform our usual political feat of ensuring the continuity of the ruling government. Time is not on our side. Let\u2019s work for the perpetuation of our government in Osun State through all- known legitimate means\u201d, Famodun said.",

A civil society group under the auspices of Pe\n\nIn a statement released to thank the legislature for heeding to the cry of Nigerian electorates, the group expressed optimism that now that the law which deprived Nigerians their natural right of choosing leaders of their choice has been amended, Nigeria is on the threshold of economic, and political recovery that will guarantee freedom, prosperity and peace to all.\n\nThe statement signed by the President of PLIF, Sir Precious Elekim\u00e0 regretted that Nigerians had never had the opportunity to elect their political leadership largely due to the porous and disenfranchising electoral law governing the conduct of elections in the country.\n\nSir Elekima on behalf of the People\u2019s Life Improvement Foundation heartily thank the National Assembly , Governor\u2019s, Religious Leaders, Nigerians, friends of Nigeria, on the Journey of given the power to the people of Nigeria for them to consent to who shall rule them as representatives of the people from the federal to the Local level. He said, \u201cFor nearly four years our organization, The People\u2019s Life improvement foundation saddled itself with the auduos task of ensuring that Nigerians truly understand the reason why our way of elections must change and only the people must elect their political leadership.

          "text": "\u2026..Expands scope of nonprofit Revolving Loan Scheme to women\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation NGO, under the auspices of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has called on government at all levels to end food insecurity through the empowerment of rural women.\n\nThe group also advocates the inclusion of indigenous women, in enhancing agricultural and rural development, and eradicating rural poverty.\n\nThe President and Founder of the NGO, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made the call in a statement on Friday as part of activities to mark 2021 International Day of Rural Women IDRW, which is marked every 15th Oct to celebrate rural women all over the world.\n\nShe said this year\u2019s International Day of Rural Women with the theme: Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All\u201d was in line with the ongoing programmes being carried out by the Helpline Foundation in recent times aimed at encouraging access to food and addressing hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\n\nDr. Ahmadu, while drawing the attention of the government at all levels to rural women\u2019s plights in Nigeria, added that providing training and empowerment for rural women was in line with Helpline Foundation\u2019s plans of cushioning hardships associated with their environment.\n\nAhmadu said: \u201cOct 15th is set aside for the marking of the IDRW, the essence of the event is to create awareness on the rural women and their plights in FCT and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that rural women and girls play essential roles in food systems in Nigeria\u2013 from production, to processing, preparation, consumption, and distribution of food \u2013 as well as in securing household and community nutrition. Yet, unequal power relations between women and men in the household and society, discriminatory gender norms and practices, prevalent violence against women and girls, and their disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, result in unequal access to food and heightened experience of hunger, malnutrition, undernutrition, and food insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year being Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All , was as a result of neglect to the rural women by the policymakers, as the government does not remember them. So this awareness creation will make the government remember them, because they have a lot at hand, including problems of the upbringing of their children, among other things they are helplessly tackling.\n\n\u201cIt will surprise you to know that in some communities, they are treated unfairly and there is nobody to assist them. So for that, we are beckoning on the government at all levels to consider the widows in their policy-making. We are appealing to all the governments to consider and include them in their budgets. If this our appeals are considered, it will go a long way.\u201d\n\nOn the part of the NGO, she said \u201d We have so far embarked on periodic training and empowerment to the rural women annually across some selected communities in the six area councils of the FCT and suburbs.\n\n\u201cWhy we train and empower them is to enable them to cope with the harsh economy all over the world. Some of the rural women organisation that benefited from our empowerment programmes includes Yeyedu women, Bwari women and Kurudu women.\n\n\u201cAlso the Foundation has given out the none-profit Revolving Loan Scheme for women in our rural communities ongoing for the past 7 years respectively, where over 1000 have benefitted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, they don\u2019t have anybody to assist them, and the only way out is to train and empower them. We have trained about 1000 of them and after that, we gave them starter packs and advised them to be industrious and prudent in the management of their resources.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the ongoing training, Mrs Maria Afiniki, confirmed that she learned a lot through the training and was also empowered, even as she tasked the government to support genuine NGOs to assist rural women.",

The president, he said, therefore charged the Ministry on the harmonization of the development plans.\n\n\u201cThe two major plans developed with the assistance of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support the Ministry in coordinating development and implementation some years ago include the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Regional Development Master Plan and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs (MNDA), Niger Delta Action Plan.\n\n\u201cSuccessive efforts by other stakeholders in the region also led to the initiation of other existing development plans. Therefore the multiplicity of plans, absence of standardization and failure to manage the plans led to poor delivery of those plans and their expected outcomes,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIn actualizing the Presidential directives an initial study of the existing plans was carried out by a consultant engaged by the Ministry. This process produced a strategic document for the development of a united single plan for the region, which would be adopted as a working document for the committee,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile urging the committee to take the assignment very serious, he outlined the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the committee among others to include, reviewing the initiating framework for the Harmonization of the Development plans in the Niger Delta Region into a single coherent Regional Development Strategy.\n\nAlfred Abah, Director Planning, Research and Statistics in the Ministry, will chair the Committee, which is expected to enhance government efforts to achieve the desired development in the region. Membership of the committee is drawn from the Ministry and the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Committee while soliciting for the support of the Ministry and NDDC, assured the Permanent Secretary that the Committee does not have any reason to fail.\n\nHe said the committee would start by setting out a work plan and time line, which will produce the desired result and would not hesitate to co-opt any of the directorates when the need arises.",

While the Congress Committee Chairman, Komral Longap, welcomed the delegates, the team\u2019s secretary, Segun Olamibi, announced that voting would be by consensus.\n\nThe new executive members were later adopted by an APC chieftain, Jamiu Ekungba, on behalf of the party, an action that was seconded by a member of the House of Representatives from Owo/Ose Constituency, Timehin Adelegbe.\n\nAdetimehin, in his acceptance speech, thanked the leadership and members of the party for their support and promised that the new executive members would serve the APC with total commitment.\n\nSetback In Taraba\n\nJust like in other states, APC members in Kaduna adopted the consensus option to elect new state executive committee members.\n\nThis led to the emergence of Air Commodore Emmanuel Jekada as the state chairman, while some former officials of the party were returned unopposed.\n\nThe Congress Committee Chairman, Abubakar Moddibo, explained that the consensus option adopted by the state chapter was in line with the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai; his deputy, Hadiza Balarabe; Speaker of Kaduna State House of Assembly, Yusuf Zailani, and others attended the Congress held at the Murtala Mohammed Square in the Kaduna state capital.\n\nThe congress was also monitored by INEC officials led by the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kaduna.\n\nAs the congress held in Ogun, Niger, and other states, it suffered a setback in Taraba where the exercise was rescheduled indefinitely.\n\nAPC spokesman in the state, Bulus Gago, confirmed this to Channels Television on Saturday. No reason was given for the postponement of the state congress.\n\nOn Wednesday, some stakeholders of the party threatened to boycott the congress, as well as file a suit if their grievances were not addressed.\n\nThese include the inability of the national headquarters to publish winners of the ward and local government congresses, alleged hijacking of the party structure by some bigwigs, among others.",

          "text": "The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that half a million women, men and children in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states are at risk of starvation as its funding for the region dries up.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, the global agency says it may soon be forced to cut food rations except it secures urgent funding to continue its life-saving operations in the crisis hotspot.\n\nThe region has been a mainstay of insurgency attacks for over a decade and the situation has been worsened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising high food prices, the WFP said.\n\nThe UN agency also said the number of internally-displaced persons surpassed two million in September.\n\nREAD ALSO: UN Slams \u2018Horrific\u2019 Violence Against Migrants In Libya\n\n\u201cCutting rations means choosing who gets to eat and who goes to bed hungry. We are seeing funding for our life-saving humanitarian work dry up just at the time when hunger is at its most severe,\u201d said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s Regional Director for West Africa following a recent visit to Nigeria.\n\nThe WFP, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2020, said it required at least $55 million in a matter of weeks to avoid cutting food aid.\n\n\u201cOur food assistance is a lifeline for millions whose lives have been upended by conflict and have almost nothing to survive on. We must act now to save lives and avoid disruptions to this lifeline,\u201d Nikoi added.\n\nThe United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said cutting food assistance \u201cwill be a painful decision for humanitarians as it will negatively affect children, women and men uprooted from their homes due to continued violence.\n\n\u201cAs we call upon our partners to step up their support in response to the growing needs, I would like to say thank you to those who have stood with us over the years in providing the much-needed humanitarian assistance in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to its Friday statement, the WFP said it has \u201cprovided life-saving food and nutrition assistance to severely food insecure people, displaced families in camps, and to vulnerable people living in host communities thanks to generous contributions from Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and private donors.\n\n\u201cThis year, relying on the continued generosity of donor partners, WFP ramped up its response to address rising food insecurity and the impact of COVID-19, targeting 1.9 million displaced people in Nigeria with life-saving food assistance.\n\n\u201cTo sustain humanitarian operations in northeast Nigeria until March 2022, WFP urgently requires USD 197 million.\u201d",

They created big chances and Mendy was the key to the clean sheet,\u201d Tuchel said.\n\nAt the start of a five-game run of winnable league fixtures, Tuchel had warned his players not to expect an easy ride from Brentford and the Chelsea boss was proved right.\n\n\u201cWe were very strong for 70 minutes and very lucky for 20 minutes, to sum it up,\u201d Tuchel said.\n\n\u201cWe escaped with the three points thanks to Edouard. It was like a cup game at the end; they took risks and the atmosphere gave them a lot of courage.\n\n\u201cIt is better to be there at the top but there are way too many teams who are close.\u201d\n\nJust five months ago, the gulf between the clubs appeared huge as Chelsea won the Champions League on the day Brentford earned promotion to the top-flight for the first time since 1947.\n\nHowever, Brentford had already bloodied the noses of two supposedly superior opponents this term, with Arsenal beaten at the Community Stadium and Liverpool held to a draw.\n\nThey pushed Chelsea to the brink as well with another spirited showing.\n\nRomelu Lukaku was without a club goal in his last five games and the Belgium striker misfired with Chelsea\u2019s first shot of the game, bending a free-kick well off target.\n\nBrentford nearly snatched the lead when a set-piece caused havoc in the Chelsea defence and Bryan Mbeumo slammed his shot against the post.\n\nBrentford barrage\n\nTuchel\u2019s men weren\u2019t at their most fluent as Brentford worked tirelessly to deny them time and space.\n\nTimo Werner held his head in frustration after curling inches wide with a strike from the edge of the area after Lukaku teed up the German.\n\nChilwell finally broke Brentford\u2019s stubborn resistance in the first minute of stoppage-time as the left-back extended his unexpected hot streak.\n\nCesar Azpilicueta\u2019s cross towards Lukaku was only cleared to the edge of the area, where Chilwell was waiting to lash a superb strike high past Raya.\n\nChilwell\u2019s second goal in his last two Chelsea games came after he also netted for England against Andorra during the recent international break.\n\nChelsea were without defenders Thiago Silva and Toni Rudiger, with Malang Sarr making his Premier League debut.\n\nThe Blues had conceded just one goal from open play in the league this season and the stand-ins somehow held firm amid Brentford\u2019s second half barrage.\n\nMendy had to make his first save in the 73rd minute when the Senegal keeper repelled Ivan Toney\u2019s snap-shot.\n\nMbeumo almost grabbed a Brentford equaliser with a low drive that beat Mendy, only to cannon back off the post before Chelsea cleared the danger.\n\nWith Brentford pouring forward, Mendy had to save again from a Saman Ghoddos effort before Trevoh Chalobah cleared Christian Norgaard\u2019s shot off the line.\n\nMendy made yet another great stop, diving at Pontus Jansson\u2019s feet to keep out the Brentford captain\u2019s close-range shot.\n\nInevitably, there was more work for Mendy to do in stoppage-time and he rose to the challenge with a brilliant tip-over from Norgaard\u2019s overhead kick.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration on Friday said it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block a restrictive Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on abortion after a federal appeals court reinstated the law.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department will ask the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to reverse the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to lift a judge\u2019s order blocking the law, while litigation over the dispute continues, a spokesman said.\n\nThe Texas measure, which bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, took effect on Sept. 1. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.\n\nThe law is unusual in that it gives private citizens the power to enforce it by enabling them to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature has helped shield the law from being immediately blocked as it made it more difficult to directly sue the state.\n\nCritics of the law have said this provision \u2013 which provides monetary awards for those whose lawsuits are successful \u2013 lets people act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Texas over the abortion law last month, arguing that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy as recognized in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The department also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.\n\nIn his ruling blocking the law on Oct. 6, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, found that the law was likely unconstitutional and designed to avoid judicial scrutiny. The judge said he would \u201cnot sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court previously allowed the law to be enforced in a separate challenge to the ban brought by abortion providers. In that 5-4 decision on Sept. 1, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts expressed skepticism about how the law is enforced.\n\nThe Texas measure prohibits abortion at a point when many women do not even realize they are pregnant. Under the law, individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits against those who perform or help others obtain an abortion that violates the ban.\n\nThe Supreme Court already is set to consider a major abortion case on Dec. 1 in a dispute centering on Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban in which that state has asked the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. A ruling is due by the end of June 2022.",
