          "text": "By David Odama\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, over 35,000 residents of Nasarawa state Saturday rolled out their drums in support of the presidential candidature of the Labour party, Peter Obi.\n\nSpeaking to Journalists during a town hall meeting with stakeholders and leaders of various support groups of Peter Obi in Lafia, the State Chairman of the party, Alexander Emmanuel said the people of the state were tired with the misrule of the All Progressives Congress led government both at the national and state levels which was why they decided to support the Labour party in 2023.\n\nEmmanuel explained that the 35,000 supporters of the party were members of 27 registered support groups across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state who were on partnership with the support of the party\n\nAccording to the party Chairman, the support group in collaboration with the party were set to hold a one-million-man march on August 6th, 2022, to sensitise other residents of the state to vote for Labour party and it\u2019s presidential candidate, Peter Obi and other candidates in the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we speak today, Nigeria is in a serious delimma. We are faced with the problem of existential threats. The Nigerian nation has plunged into the multifarious problems of insecurity, unemployment, electricity blackout, comatoes economy, civic stress and widespread poverty.\n\n\u201cThese problems are not natural; They are man-made. The past and present managers of our common heritage brought the country to her knees, and brought us to the pitiable state we find ourselves today.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, Nigeria needs a leader that will turn things around for the better, and I make bold to say that among the presidential candidates of all the political parties, it is only Peter Obi that has what it takes to move the nation forward.\n\n\u201cBut Obi cannot do it alone. He needs our collective support to be able to emerge as President in 2023, so I am urging all residents of Nasarawa state to join us in this struggle for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOne of the coordinators of the support groups who spoke on behalf of the others, Wilson Kingsley said they had perfected plans to embark on a door-to-door sensitisation campaign across the 13 LGAs of the state, as soon as campaigns officially begin.\n\nWhile appealing to other residents of the state to support Peter Obi\u2019s ambition, he expressed confidence that the Labour party presidential candidate and other candidates of the party will emerge victorious in the 2023 elections.\n\nEarlier in her remark, the National Deputy Chairman of the party, Ladi Iliya urged residents of the state who were yet to get their Permanent Voter Cards, to register before the closing date on July 31st, 2022, in order to be able to exercise their franchise in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe challenges confronting Nigeria are numerous because we do not have good leaders in office. Our universities have been closed for many months now but they are not worried because their children go to other countries to study. It is so sad that we have such leaders occupying political offices.\n\n\u201cBut I am happy that the Independent National Electoral Commission have assured us that our votes will count in 2023. So, I am urging all Nigerians who are yet to get their Permanent Voter Cards, to do so immediately in order for us to vote-in credible leaders into office in the coming elections\u201d, she said.",

          "text": "There are strongs indications that a plan by Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki to build a modern museum to house some of the stolen artifacts, recently returned to the state from Europe, may have met a brick wall as leaders and concerned stakeholders of the state have opposed the idea in its entirety.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that members of the coalition, under the auspices of Benin Social Cultural Organisations described the project as a white elephant one, which also runs contrary to the traditions, culture as well as royalty of the Benin kingdom.\n\nThey have therefore vowed to resist the project just as they described the proposed Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) as completely alien to the Benin race and culture.\n\nThe group took to a press conference in Benin city on Saturday, to express their grievances, accusing Gov. Obaseki of disrespecting and undermining the Oba of Benin, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku\u2019 Akpolokpolo Ewuare 11, especially in terms of housing the artifacts.\n\nThey reminded him of his earlier promise to support the idea of a Benin Royal Museum for the artifacts.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cObaseki should be a man of his words because EMOWAA was not what he discussed with the Oba of Benin and other prominent Benin elders in 2018 and by his actions, the governor had reneged on his words and it is tantamount to betrayal of public trust\u201d.\n\nThe coalition also alleged that with the look of things the proposed EMOWAA project was not owned by the Edo State Government but by Obaseki\u2019s private venture called Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd.\n\nThe group further stated: \u201cThe attention of the leaders and stakeholders of Coalition of Benin Socio Cultural Organisations has been drawn to Governor Obaseki\u2019s statement where he asserted that he doesn\u2019t have conflict with our revered Monarch over his proposed EMOWAA.\u201cSincerely, we were shocked that His Excellency, Godwin Obaseki asserted that he doesn\u2019t have any issue nor quarrel with our revered Oba of Benin Kingdom whereas when he organised a Stakeholders engagement meeting regarding his proposed EMOWAA phase 1, he didn\u2019t involve our revered Palace.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, you didn\u2019t only have issue or conflict with our revered Monarch over your EMOWAA, you also have issue with all the Benins for always disrespecting and undermining our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom. For the avoidance of doubt, the word EMOWAA is alien to us as Benin people.\u201dThey said the Coalition had been at the forefront \u201cof advocating and assisting our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom to ensure that our stolen artifacts are returned to the Palace.\u201d\n\nRecall that the history of the Benin kingdom dates back to a few centuries when the colonial masters came to Africa, dominating many of the territories and taking away artifacts unique to the Benins.\n\nHowever the state and government at the federal level have collaborated to cajole the European museums where some of the artifacts were stored to return them back to their original source.\n\nBeyond the controversies that the museum project has generated, Benin is allegedly reputed for high human trafficking overseas, a situation the state government has been strengthening advocacy to curtail.",

          "title": "Atiku's interview deepens anger in Wike's camp The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt and Dare Odufowokan\n\nPDP\u2019s candidate has scores to settle with Rivers, says Chidi Lloyd\n\nAtiku\u2019s response disappointing, betrays genuine reconciliation \u2013 SNPA\n\nRivers gov: I\u2019ll speak soon\n\nPeoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP\u2019s) Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, may have compounded his sour relationship with Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike after suggesting that he could not work amicably with the governor as running mate.\n\nAsked on Arise Television on Friday why he picked Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa over and above Wike, Atiku had said he chose someone who has \u201cthe qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless All Progressives Congress government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut you must understand that it\u2019s the prerogative of the candidate to pick his running mate \u2014 a running mate he believes he can work with amicably, and then also deliver the policies of the party, and also try to unify the country.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered yesterday in Port Harcourt that the Atiku statement has sparked fresh anger against the former vice president in Wike\u2019s camp which is already aggrieved by what is perceived as the former vice president\u2019s ill treatment of the governor in overlooking him as PDP\u2019s vice presidential candidate.\n\nEfforts to reconcile the two sides so far have repeatedly hit the rocks with Atiku saying during his Friday interview that he was reaching out to Wike to let bygones be bygones.\n\nHowever, the much sought reconciliation appears to have been dealt a fresh blow by the Atiku statement.\n\nThe Nation gathered that many associates of Wike were shocked by Atiku\u2019s statement which they claimed depicted the governor as someone he could not work with amicably.\n\nThey were also miffed that Atiku denied that Wike was the choice of the majority members of the selection committee of the PDP.\n\nA source in the governor\u2019s camp said: \u201cThe statements are unbecoming of someone seeking reconciliation and peace. We have been advised to refrain from saying things that can affect the unity of the party and we did.\n\n\u201cBut what can one say about Atiku\u2019s outburst? Is this how to pacify someone who is genuinely angered? It is obvious that some people feel that they don\u2019t need some of us in their race to the presidency.\u201d\n\nSources said a meeting scheduled for this weekend to discuss Atiku\u2019s request for reconciliation with Wike did not take place.\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State was said to be the convener of the meeting.\n\nBut our source said: \u201cNo meeting took place. I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t hold.\u201d\n\nOne source said the Benue governor may have also been angered by Atiku\u2019s claim that he lied about the recommendation of the committee he chaired for the nomination of the PDP running mate.\n\n\u201cLast Thursday, the day before Atiku\u2019s interview, Ortom had repeated his claim that Wike won when the issue was put to vote at the committee level.\n\nHe said: \u201cOf course, three names were presented. In the order of preference, Wike, Okowa and governor Udom \u2013 all of them are qualified.\n\n\u201cBut the preference was Wike \u2013 14 members (referring to the committee) out of 17. This is the point we are making. Three of them were qualified but governor Wike was eminently qualified \u2013 14 out of 17 members chose him.\n\n\u201cAll these things were said during our meeting. We said that for the PDP to win, we needed Governor Wike.\n\n\u201cYes, Wike may have his own weak points as others may see it, but to some people, those were his strong points in this life.\n\n\u201cFor me, the candidate who won the primary has the final say. He has decided. I have no problem with that.\u201d\n\nBut Atiku, in his interview, said there was nothing of such.\n\n\u201cWhat he said was inaccurate. I can give you a copy that was sent to me; there was no voting there, there was no record of any vote, absolutely not.\n\n\u201cThe committee that was set up at my own instance deliberated, but there was no vote and they recommended three names because they knew that it was prerogative to pick any one of the three, so there was actually no vote.\n\n\u201cMore so, Ortom himself chaired that committee. He knew that there was a vote taken and I have the report of that committee,\u201d the PDP presidential candidate insisted.\n\nA close ally of Wike and Chairman of Emohua Local Government Area, Dr. Chidi Lloyd as well as the Leader, Southern Nigeria Peoples Assembly (SNPA), Livingstone Wechie, yesterday described Atiku\u2019s statement as disappointing.\n\nLloyd said Atiku exacerbated an already tensed situation in the PDP through his remarks and had shown that he was not ready to become the President of everybody if elected in 2023.\n\nThe PDP stalwart said Atiku had also shown that he had scores to settle with Rivers and that the state would suffer neglect if he emerged the President.\n\nHe warned that Atiku was toying with Governor Wike, who already has over 2.5 million votes in his kitty and the capacity to deliver them.\n\nLloyd said Atiku\u2019s statement was also an indication that he was not reliable and wondered whether the former Vice-President was denying that the PDP never set up a 19-man committee before he chose his running mate.\n\nHe said: \u201cI do not want to think that the statement credited to the presidential candidate was actually his statement. I do not think that the presidential candidate, as experienced as they say he is politically, will make such a statement. He wants to exacerbate an already tense situation.\n\n\u201cIf that statement was made by him, truly it is obvious that he is not prepared to be the President of everybody. Clearly, he has personalised governance. He sees it as personal estate. He chose someone he can work with, not in the interest of the nation. It makes me very scared as a member of the PDP.\n\n\u201cHe chose someone who could be President on a minute notice. It is not palatable to come from Atiku Abubakar. His interview has given me an insight into the kind of person he is. He cannot be reliable.\n\n\u201cIs Atiku saying that the party did not set up a 19-man committee? What was the committee asked to do? He has made his choice.\n\n\u201cAs a flagbearer, Atiku had held close to five or six flags of different political parties. One thing is to be a flag bearer but another thing is to win. But he is dealing with a governor that has 2.5 million votes in his kitty and will deliver them without much ado.\n\n\u201cYou are making this kind of statement when we thought that the ongoing reconciliation is genuine. The statement from Atiku is also the statement of those who hang around him.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for the reforms in the electoral system; the voters will decide at the end of the day. We are with our governor. Whichever direction he wants us to go, we will go.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Governor Wike; it is about Rivers State. It is obvious that we will be left out if Atiku becomes President.\u201d\n\nWechie in his reaction said Atiku\u2019s response betrayed whatever genuine reconciliation is ongoing in the party, noting that nobody could rescue the country with a divided house.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe assertions by Alhaji Atiku Abubakar that he chose his running mate based on who he is comfortable with implies that he is not comfortable with Governor Nyesom Wike and the reasons are not disclosed. This is below dignity and should be eschewed.\n\n\u201cMoreso, the choice of a running mate must not be personal because it is not about him as a person (Atiku Abubakar) rather it is about Nigeria and who can produce the needed result.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Atiku Abubakar was a beneficiary of a judgment where the Supreme Court held that as vice-president under the Olusegun Obasanjo administration, that a Vice-President is not a vice to the President per se but the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and he knows this without pretence.\n\n\u201cA Vice-President is not an appendage of the President and he must know it to be so in order not to place his personal interest above Nigeria\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhat is expected of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar while he makes efforts to resolve issues with Governor Nyesom Wike is to acknowledge Governor Nyesom Wike\u2019s qualification to be both President and indeed a Vice-President but for the fact that one person must emerge. But he neglected to do so during his last interview and played to the gallery.\u201d\n\nWechie added: \u201cThe statements made by the PDP Presidential Candidate falls grossly below crisis management rhetoric and it is somewhat disappointing. Ordinarily, he should know better that such conversations have become very slippery particularly when he is yet to meet Governor Nyesom Wike to iron out issues.\n\n\u201cObviously there are both unresolved and trust issues hanging. Alhaji Atiku Abubakar should remember the adage that says to whom much is given much is expected. He must divorce himself from the Babangida Aliyu\u2019s type of denigrating postulations and speak in a way that goes beyond self and look at the bigger project as an elder statesman and a presumed nationalist.\n\n\u201cYou cannot rescue Nigeria with a divided house. He appears to be stoking the fire unnecessary in an ostensible manner beyond what is expected of him as a statesman in his right.\u201d\n\nWechie observed that the attitude of Atiku and his utterances had made Wike a hero, saying the Rivers governor had become irresistible in the political equation ahead of 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo matter what anyone feels, Wike has been made popular and almost irresistible in the political equation as long as 2023 is concerned, which is why he is being rushed beyond the partisan fray.\n\n\u201cIt is unstrategic for the PDP Presidential standard bearer to be making innuendos that cast doubt as to the genuineness of any reconciliation with a Nyesom Wike who is today priced by watchers as the most consistent opposition political voice in Nigeria since 1999 till date that speaks truth to power.\n\nWike: I\u2019ll speak soon\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike himself promised yesterday to speak soon on the recent happenings in the PDP.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said it had become pertinent for him to speak and reveal to Nigerians all that had transpired in the PDP since the emergence of former Vice-President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cOn Atiku, I will speak soon and Nigerians will know the actual truth of all that has transpired in the PDP in recent times,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: Tinubu, Atiku fight dirty",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nPresidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, yesterday fired back at his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart, Atiku Abubakar, describing him as a demeaning pathological liar.\n\nAtiku had while taking a swipe at Tinubu on a national television revealed that he rejected the former Lagos State governor as his presidential running mate in 2007 under the Action Congress (AC) because of his position against Muslim-Muslim joint ticket.\n\nBut Tinubu replying Atiku said that Nigerians should feel great pity and sadness for Atiku, claiming that the PDP candidate in his desperate attempt to win the 2023 presidential election through stoking religious bias reduced himself to uttering baseless lies.\n\nHe also described Atiku as a man reputed in reneging on his promise, stressing that he has no moral justification raising the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket other than to confirm that he is a hypocrite.\n\nTinubu, reacting through a statement issued by his Media Office, signed by Tunde Rahman, noted: \u201cWe are saddened to see such a man become unhinged from the truth. So obsessed with his quest for office, Atiku is willing to render any form of untruth if he thinks it might gain him a single vote. Atiku may want to be president; however, all he has shown is that he is pathological.\n\n\u201cWhatever moral compass he had has been lost. During a July 22 television interview, Atiku assaulted historic truth by lying that he did not name Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the AC ticket because Atiku did not want a Muslim as his running mate.\u201d\n\nTinubu, setting the record straight, recalled that Atiku was not among those that founded the Action Congress.\n\n\u201cIt was the actual founders of the AC who offered the party\u2019s flag to Atiku because of the need to fight the authoritarian designs then President Obasanjo and the PDP had on Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, Atiku had been unceremoniously pushed aside if not out of the PDP by Obasanjo. We needed to rally all forces to confront the one-party state Obasanjo had in mind. Atiku was simply a beneficiary of this collective duty to fight the attack on multi-party democracy the PDP had launched.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for dear old Atiku. Love of his own ambition has eclipsed his relationship with the truth and an honest account of the past. We formed the AC without his knowledge. When President Obasanjo virtually exiled him from the PDP, we lent him our support by giving him the AC platform for the 2007 election,\u201d Tinubu noted.\n\nThe APC presidential standard bearer claimed Atiku\u2019s account was contrary to what transpired.\n\n\u201cLet me say openly that Atiku offered me the vice presidential ticket in 2007. Let me also say that my religion has not changed. When he offered the position to me, I was a Muslim and I believe he was aware of my religious faith at the time.\n\n\u201cAtiku\u2019s calculations and deceit had nothing to do with religion or his sensitivity to it. His conduct has everything to do with what we discovered about his paucity of character and love of intrigue. True to form, Atiku, 15 years later, promised Governor Nyesom Wike the same thing this electoral season and similarly reneged. Governor Wike is a Christian.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to intrigue, we can say that Atiku is without bias. He will attempt to lie and deceive both Christian and Muslim with equal vigour. Atiku has no business raising the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket except as a hypocrite. Perhaps he believes people have forgotten his antics during the 1993 election.\n\n\u201cAfter he woefully lost his bid to be the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), what did he do? He canvassed and lobbied harder than anyone to become the running mate to late Chief MKO Abiola. When it benefitted him personally, Atiku did not see anything wrong with Muslim-Muslim ticket. He saw everything right in such a ticket as long as he was on it.\n\n\u201cNow, Atiku criticizes my selection as running mate based on religion. He does so because he cannot criticize it on other grounds. If Atiku were to have one of his rare moments of honesty, he would admit that the person I selected as my running mate is more qualified for the position than the man who joined him. And this conclusion has nothing to do with religious faith. It has everything to do with competence, experience, ability, and vision,\u201d he quipped.\n\nDefending his choice of Kashim Shetima, Tinubu said: \u201cMy running mate and I are here to build a more just and prosperous society for all Nigerians; be they Christian, Muslim or adherents of other faiths. It seems that Atiku is here trying to build an edifice of lies and call that the house into which Nigerians should walk and reside. He will fail in this sad attempt to trick an entire nation.\n\n\u201cLet me restate my position on religion and politics. When I decided that Senator Shettima was the best selection as my running mate, I listened to and weighed in serious balance the advice received from a broad and representative array of wonderful Nigerians who deeply care about this nation and the path it must go.\n\n\u201cSome people counselled that I should select a Christian to garner the support of the Christian community. Some said I should select a Muslim for a similar reason. I clearly could not do both. Both positions had merit and right on their side. But neither position expressed what was most right and needed for the moment in which we find ourselves and the nation.\n\n\u201cAll my life, the decisions regarding the team supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence. I was not going to depart from these principles at this important juncture. In fact, it was more important than ever before that I adhere to these principles.\n\n\u201cAs governor of Lagos State, these principles helped me assemble one of the most capable governing cabinets any state or this nation has seen. I trust in these principles to allow them to, once more, guide me to construct another exemplary team that can do Nigeria proud.\n\n\u201cIn this crucial moment, where so much is at stake, we must prioritize leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations.\n\n\u201cThis is the standard I will use to select the rest of my campaign team and if you elect me as your president when I staff my government I will select the best people for the right jobs so that we can construct a better Nigeria now and for generations yet to come.\u201d",

          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nThe United Nations through the UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has asked the Nigerian Government to immediately release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, unconditionally and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary infringement of his fundamental human rights.\n\nAlso, the UN organ indicted both Nigeria and Kenya governments for his arrest and extraordinary rendition, torture and continued detention without due process.\n\nThe UN body further recommended that government officials responsible for the torture meted to Kanu be investigated and punished, while directing the Federal Government to report back within six months of the transmission of its opinions on the matter, and steps taken to comply with all the recommendations thereof.\n\nThis is as the rights group further threatened to take additional action to ensure the recommendations are complied with, stressing that both Nigeria and Kenya are signatories to the Convention and should act in accordance with the terms.\n\nThe UN organ referred the case of Kanu\u2019s torture to Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration.\n\nThis directive was contained in a 16-page report dated July 20, 2022, which was adopted on April 4, by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its 93rd session.\n\nThe unedited version of the document sighted by Sunday Sun was marked: \u201cOpinion No. 25/2022 concerning Mr Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu (Nigeria and Kenya).\u201d\n\nThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established in resolution 1991/42 of the UN Commission on Human Rights.\n\nIn accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group, on December 30, 2021, transmitted to the Nigeria and Kenya governments, a communication concerning Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria replied to the communication on January 25, 2022 while the Government of Kenya did not reply.\n\nBoth countries are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nBelow is full text of the UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention Report: Advance Unedited Version\n\nHuman Rights Council\n\nWorking Group on Arbitrary Detention\n\nOpinions adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its ninety-third session, 30 March \u2013 8 April 2022\n\nOpinion No. 25/2022 concerning Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu (Nigeria and Kenya)\n\n1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established in resolution 1991/42 of the Commission on Human Rights. In its resolution 1997/50, the Commission extended and clarified the mandate of the Working Group. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human Rights Council decision 1/102, the Council assumed the mandate of the Commission. The Council most recently extended the mandate of the Working Group for a three-year period in its resolution 42/22.\n\n2. In accordance with its methods of work,1 on 30 December 2021 the Working Group transmitted to the Government of Nigeria and Kenya a communication concerning Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu. The Government of Nigeria replied to the communication on 25 January 2022 while the Government of Kenya did not reply. Both States are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n3. The Working Group regards deprivation of liberty as arbitrary in the following cases:\n\n(a) When it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of liberty (as when a person is kept in detention after the completion of his or her sentence or despite an amnesty law applicable to him or her) (category I);\n\n(b) When the deprivation of liberty results from the exercise of the rights or freedoms guaranteed by articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, insofar as States parties are concerned, by articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27 of the Covenant (category II);\n\n(c) When the total or partial non-observance of the international norms relating to the right to a fair trial, established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned, is of such gravity as to give the deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character (category III);\n\n(d) When asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees are subjected to prolonged administrative custody without the possibility of administrative or judicial review or remedy (category IV);\n\n(e) When the deprivation of liberty constitutes a violation of international law on the grounds of discrimination based on birth, national, ethnic or social origin, language, religion, economic condition, political or other opinion, gender, sexual orientation, disability,\n\n* Inaccordancewithparagraph5oftheWorkingGroup\u2019smethodsofwork,ElinaSteinertedidnot participate in the discussion of the present case.\n\n1 A/HRC/36/38.\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\n2 or any other status, that aims towards or can result in ignoring the equality of human beings (category V).\n\nSubmissions\n\nCommunication from the source\n\n4. Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu is a citizen of the United Kingdom, born in 1967. At the time of his arrest, he resided in Nairobi, Kenya. Mr. Kanu is an activist and the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, which he founded in 2012. The source explains that the Indigenous People of Biafra is an organization aimed at securing a referendum for a Biafran sovereignty, independent from Nigeria.\n\na. Arrest and detention\n\n5. The source reports that on 19 June 2021, Mr. Kanu, who was lawfully present in Kenya, was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, in Nairobi, Kenya, by Kenyan Security Forces. According to the source, Mr. Kanu was swiftly taken to an undisclosed and unknown location, which was not a police station or any of the conventional Kenyan security detention facilities. The Kenyan Special Forces reportedly subjected Mr. Kanu to eight days of severe torture and ill-treatment, which caused him physical injuries and mental anguish.\n\n6. According to the source, on or about 29 June 2021, Mr. Kanu was extraordinarily renditioned to Abuja, Nigeria, with no prior hearing before a judicial or administrative body. The source emphasizes that Mr. Kanu was not given access to counsel and was denied extradition proceedings in Kenya. The source notes that, according to Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Mr. Kanu was apprehended and transported to Abuja with the cooperation of Nigerian intelligence officials and Interpol. Mr. Kanu was then reportedly detained within the headquarters of the Department of State Security Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) in Abuja, Nigeria.\n\n7. Reportedly, the Federal Government of Nigeria initially charged Mr. Kanu with four offenses: conspiracy to commit treasonable felony in 2014 and 2015, treasonable felony in 2014 and 2015, defamation in 2015, and improper importation of goods in 2015. The source alleges that these offenses are manufactured and all relate to old events. Further, the Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly amended the charges against Mr. Kanu to include accusations of levying war against Nigeria in 2015, through a radio broadcast from London, which the source alleges scrupulously refrained from inciting or encouraging violence or illegality. The amended charges reportedly charge Mr. Kanu with seven offenses.\n\n8. The source reports that a hearing of Mr. Kanu\u2019s case was scheduled to take place on 26 July 2021, but Department operatives failed to produce Mr. Kanu in court without giving any reason, causing the case to be adjourned to 21 October 2021.\n\n9. According to the source, on 21 October 2021, a hearing was held to address Mr. Kanu\u2019s motion to dismiss. Reportedly, the Department blocked all traffic to the courthouse, which forced Mr. Kanu\u2019s legal team to walk more than one mile to be able to attend the proceedings. The source also notes that the Department surrounded the court complex with an array of armed forces, creating an atmosphere of intimidation and danger. During the hearing, the court allegedly sharply reprimanded the Department for repeatedly blocking the access of Mr. Kanu\u2019s lawyers to their client, and unambiguously ordered them to permit Mr. Kanu to meet any three persons he wished on Mondays and Thursdays, for two hours each day.\n\n10. The source reports that, the following Monday, on 25 October 2021, Mr. Kanu\u2019s lawyers visited the Department headquarters, pursuant to the court\u2019s order of 21 October 2021. While Mr. Kanu\u2019s lawyer confirmed his identity and was cleared for visitation, the Department required all lawyers to wait for over 90 minutes. Thereafter, they reportedly announced that Mr. Kanu\u2019s international lawyer would never be permitted to visit his client because he was a foreigner, and that the key to the locked visitation room could not be retrieved and thus, no person would be able to visit Mr. Kanu on that day. As a result, Mr. Kanu\u2019s attorneys were unable to meet with their client.\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\n11. Reportedly, an Affidavit of Facts was submitted to the Federal High Court of Nigeria on 21 October 2021, demonstrating the Department\u2019s contempt of court and denial of access to Mr. Kanu\u2019s lawyers to their client on four occasions. According to the source, the Affidavit of Facts requested the dismissal of the seven-count amended charge based on the court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction. It also reportedly argued that the Federal Government of Nigeria failed to plead offenses cognizable under Nigerian law and violated international laws when it ordered Mr. Kanu\u2019s extraordinary rendition and denied him access to counsel of his choice.\n\n12. The source reports that, on 10 November 2021, a hearing took place before the Federal High Court of Nigeria to address Mr. Kanu\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended charges. Reportedly, the Department singled out Mr. Kanu\u2019s international lawyer from other attorneys present and denied him entry into the courtroom for the fifth time, without explanation. According to the source, Mr. Kanu\u2019s attorneys had agreed to boycott the court proceedings if the international lawyer was denied entry into the courtroom and therefore decided to move forward with the boycott. A video press conference was allegedly held outside the courtroom to explain the reasons for the boycott. The source reports that, without communicating with any of Mr. Kanu\u2019s lawyers, including his local lead counsel, the judge of the Federal High Court consulted privately with the prosecutors, in Mr. Kanu\u2019s presence but without his legal representation. The source explains that the judge subsequently adjourned the case until 19 January 2022, with no explanation.\n\n13. According to the source, since his extraordinary rendition, Mr. Kanu has been detained in solitary confinement within the headquarters of the Department in Abuja. Reportedly, Mr. Kanu is being held in a very small cell where he is exposed to daily psychological and mental torture without access to other inmates or any other person except for the Department officers. Mr. Kanu is also allegedly denied access to reading or writing materials and has been refused access to professional medical care despite a serious heart ailment. The source reports that Mr. Kanu\u2019s life is in jeopardy and that he suffers from a medical condition occasioned by gradual depletion of potassium in his system, which has defied any medical solution given to him within the Department facilities.\n\n14. The source notes that medical examinations reveal a dangerous plunge in his potassium levels. The source alleges that the facilities\u2019 medical personnel have collected 21 blood samples from him, without permission, in search of the cause of this drastic depletion. The source adds that Nigerian authorities were feeding Mr. Kanu poorly prepared food and subjecting him to food deprivation, with the intent of slowly killing him, until an action was filed on his behalf. It is noted that there have been some recent improvements in Mr. Kanu\u2019s provision of meals.\n\n15. The source reports that during his detention in Abuja, Mr. Kanu has been permitted access to two persons on Mondays and Thursdays, for two hours each session. The source notes that such time limitation is inadequate for Mr. Kanu to be able to prepare a full and professional defence. Further, the source explains that his lawyers cannot take any notes during their meetings with Mr. Kanu as they are denied pencils and paper. The source adds that on 2 and 6 September 2021, the Department of Security Services in Abuja denied access to one of Mr. Kanu\u2019s counsels during a meeting aimed at advising him on international law issues.\n\nb. Legal Analysis\n\n16. The source first submits that the detention of Mr. Kanu in solitary confinement is arbitrary and violates article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 9 (1) of the Covenant. The source notes that, as a result of the judge adjourning the case until 19 January 2022, Mr. Kanu has been deprived of liberty for over six months, since June 2021, and held in solitary confinement without a hearing on the merits of the government\u2019s allegations and without access to needed medical care. The source submits that this constitutes the very definition of arbitrary detention and violates peremptory norms of international law.\n\n17. Further, the source contends that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is void of legal basis. The source submits that the Federal Government of Nigeria alleges that Mr. Kanu committed the crime of conspiracy to commit a treasonable felony through an agreement with others to be\n\n3\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nBroadcasted from London, in view of the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty. The source notes that, while Nigerian law defines treason as \u201clevying war\u201d against Nigeria, the Federal Government of Nigeria does not allege any action implicating Mr. Kanu in the contemplation, planification, or incitement of war against Nigeria. The source argues that Mr. Kanu was in fact advocating for a peaceful referendum for the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty, in conformity with international and other relevant laws.\n\n18. Additionally, the source reports that the Federal Government of Nigeria charged Mr. Kanu with committing treasonable felony years ago, through the broadcast on Radio Biafra of announcements of the preparation for secession of states in the South-East and South-South zones of Nigeria. The source notes that this charge similarly does not allege that the broadcast contemplated, incited, urged, or encouraged warfare or violence of any type against Nigeria.\n\n19. The source also notes that Mr. Kanu is accused of defamation for an old broadcast critical of the Major General. The source argues that this falls under Mr. Kanu\u2019s free speech and protected opinion guaranteed under article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 19 of the Covenant.\n\n20. The source also observes that Mr. Kanu was accused of illegally importing a radio transmitter wrongly characterized as a used household item, over six years before he was charged. The source submits that such a trivial charge cannot, by any measure, warrant Mr. Kanu\u2019s placement in solitary pre-trial detention, without access to necessary medical care for his cardiac condition or access to counsel to prepare his defence.\n\n21. According to the source, Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is also arbitrary in so far as he was not afforded a hearing and was denied his due process rights when he was arrested in Kenya and subjected to extraordinary rendition by the Federal Government of Nigeria, in violation of articles 9 and 14 of the Covenant. The source also argues that where an accused is kidnapped and forcibly brought within a country\u2019s jurisdiction, the courts derive their jurisdiction from the Government\u2019s own misconduct, and that governments should not benefit from their own wrongdoing.2\n\n22. Further, the source submits that Mr. Kanu was denied the right to properly prepare a defence. The source argues that Mr. Kanu\u2019s counsels were denied access to their client and to materials necessary to memorialize meetings, and were not afforded the time and facilities necessary to prepare Mr. Kanu\u2019s defence, contrary to article 14(2)(b) of the Covenant. Moreover, the source contends that the refusal to allow Mr. Kanu\u2019s international counsel into the courtroom on 10 November 2021 violated his right to be represented by counsel of his choosing, as guaranteed under the Constitution of Nigeria and various treaties to which Nigeria is a signatory. The source further submits that the fact that the judge consulted privately with the prosecutors during the 10 November 2021 hearing, while Mr. Kanu\u2019s counsels were denied entry into the courtroom, constitutes a prosecutorial bias.\n\n23. The source also contends that, by placing Mr. Kanu in solitary confinement and denying him necessary medical care to treat his heart condition, the Federal Government of Nigeria subjected him to torture, in violation of the Convention Against Torture. The source concludes that such violation makes Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention arbitrary under article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 9 (1) of the Covenant.\n\n24. According to the source, the Federal Government of Nigeria detained Mr. Kanu in retaliation for his political opinions, contrary to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 19 of the Covenant. Based on the fourth count of the amended charges, the source alleges that Mr. Kanu is being detained for professing his membership to the Indigenous People of Biafra.\n\n25. In this regard, it is alleged that the Federal Government of Nigeria arrested Mr. Kanu on terrorism-related offenses in 2015 and attempted to assassinate him on 10 September 2017, in an army-led attack that killed five individuals and wounded 30 others. Further, on 21 September 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria reportedly listed the Indigenous\n\n2 The source refers to United States Court of Appeals, United States v. Toscanino, 500 F. 2d 267, 275 (2nd Cir. 1974).\n\n4\n\na.\n\ni.\n\n3 4\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nPeople of Biafra as a terrorist organization during ex parte proceedings lacking elements of due process, including notice and the opportunity to be heard, and based on the President\u2019s assertions alone. The organization\u2019s challenge to the listing is reportedly pending on appeal. The source also reports that the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and United Nations experts have raised concerns as to the justification and legality of the organization\u2019s listing on the terrorist list.\n\n26. Finally, the source alleges that there exists hostility towards Biafrans in Nigeria and that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is based substantially on his ethnicity as a Biafran.\n\nResponses from the Governments\n\n27. On 30 December 2021, the Working Group transmitted the allegations from the source to the Governments of Nigeria and Kenya under its regular communications procedure. The Working Group requested the Governments to provide, by 28 February 2022, detailed information about the current situation of Mr. Kanu and to clarify the legal provisions justifying his continued detention, as well as its compatibility with the obligations of Nigeria and Kenya under international human rights law, and in particular with regard to the treaties ratified by the two States. Moreover, the Working Group called upon the Government of Nigeria to ensure Mr. Kanu\u2019s physical and mental integrity.\n\n28. On 25 January 2022, the Government of Nigeria submitted a reply in which it stated that, given that the case is on-going in national courts, \u201cany reaction by the Federal Government of Nigeria will be unconscionable\u201d. Nothing further was submitted by the Government of Nigeria.\n\n29. The Working Group regrets that it received no reply from the Government of Kenya and that it also did not seek an extension in accordance with paragraph 16 of Working Group\u2019s methods of work.\n\nDiscussion\n\n30. The Working Group has in its jurisprudence established the ways in which it deals with evidentiary issues. If the source has established a prima facie case for breach of international law constituting arbitrary detention, the burden of proof should be understood to rest upon the Government if it wishes to refute the allegations.3 Mere assertions by the Government that lawful procedures have been followed are not sufficient to rebut the source\u2019s allegations.4 In the present case, the Government of Kenya has opted not to challenge the prima facie credible allegations made by the source while the Government of Nigeria has only stated that since the case is on-going in national courts, \u201cany reaction by the Federal Government of Nigeria will be unconscionable\u201d.\n\n31. Noting that the allegations submitted by the source concern two Governments, the Working Group shall proceed to examine these separately.\n\nAllegations in relation to Kenya\n\n32. In the absence of a response from the Government of Kenya, the Working Group has decided to render the present opinion, in conformity with paragraph 15 of its methods of work.\n\n33. The Working Group shall consider whether the arrest and detention of Mr. Kanu by the Government of Kenya amounted to arbitrary detention within any of the categories recognised in the working methods of the Working Group.\n\nCategory I\n\n34. The source has submitted, and the Government has chosen not to contest, that when Mr. Kanu was arrested at the Nairobi Airport by Kenyan Security Forces, on 19 June 2021, he was swiftly taken to an undisclosed and unknown location, which was not a police station\n\nA/HRC/19/57, para. 68. A/HRC/19/57, para. 68.\n\n5\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nor any of the conventional Kenyan security detention facilities, and was subjected to eight days of severe torture and ill-treatment, before he was extraordinarily renditioned to Abuja, Nigeria, on or about 29 June 2021.\n\n35. The source submitted that Mr. Kanu is a British citizen, who was lawfully present in Kenya. What is clear from the source\u2019s narration is that no arrest warrant was produced to Mr. Kanu at the time of his arrest, and Kenyan authorities did not explain to him the reasons for his arrest. The Working Group is mindful that the Government has chosen not to contest any of these allegations although it had the opportunity to do so.\n\n36. The Working Group has consistently stated that for a deprivation of liberty to have a legal basis, the authorities must invoke that legal basis and apply it to the circumstances of the case through an arrest warrant. Stated differently, international law on detention includes the right to be presented with an arrest warrant in cases that do not involve arrests made in flagrante delicto, to ensure the objectivity of the arrest process. It is also required that the decision on whether the arrest is warranted be taken by an outside authority, i.e., a competent, independent and impartial judicial authority. This is procedurally inherent in the right to personal liberty and security and the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation under articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 of the Covenant, and principles 2, 4 and 10 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (the \u201cBody of Principles\u201d).5\n\n37. The Working Group is mindful that article 9 (2) of the Covenant requires that anyone who is arrested is not only informed of the reasons for the arrest but also promptly informed of any charges against them. As explained by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 35, the obligation encapsulated in article 9 (2) has two elements: information about the reasons for the arrest must be provided immediately upon arrest6 and there must be prompt information about the charges provided thereafter. Failure to do so violates article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 of the Covenant, and principle 10 of the Body of Principles, and renders the person\u2019s arrest devoid of any legal basis.\n\n38. Consequently, Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest without an arrest warrant and with no explanation as to the reasons for his arrest violated his rights under article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 of the Covenant and principles 2, 4, 10, and 36 (2) of the Body of Principles.\n\n39. Furthermore, following his arrest, Mr. Kanu was reportedly taken to an undisclosed and unknown location, which was not a police station or any of the conventional security detention facilities of Kenya, where he remained for eight days before he was transferred to Nigeria. No family members or lawyers knew about his location nor could they access him. While so detained, he was allegedly tortured and ill-treated. The Working Group once again notes the failure of the Government of Kenya to address these allegations.\n\n40. The Working Group considers that following his arrest on 19 June 2021, Mr. Kanu was subjected to enforced disappearance as he was taken to and held at an undisclosed location and his whereabouts were unknown. He remained forcibly disappeared throughout his extraordinary rendition to Nigeria, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (1) of the Covenant. The Working Group recalls that enforced disappearances are prohibited by international law and constitute a particularly aggravated form of arbitrary detention.7\n\n41. Moreover, recalling the uncontested allegations that Mr. Kanu was taken to a secret location, the Working Group reiterates that holding persons at secret, undisclosed locations and in circumstances undisclosed to the person\u2019s family and lawyers, as was the case with Mr. Kanu, violates their right to contest the legality of their detention before a court or tribunal under article 9 (4) of the Covenant. It entails a wilful refusal to disclose the fate or\n\n. 5 The Working Group has maintained from its early years that the practice of arresting persons without a warrant renders their detention arbitrary. See, for example, decisions No. 1/1993, paras. 6-7; and No. 44/1993, paras. 6-7. For more recent jurisprudence, see Opinions No. 21/2017, para. 46; No. 68/2018, para.39; and No. 34/2020, para. 46.\n\n\n\n. 6 CCPR/C/GC/35 at para 27.\n\n\n\n. 7 See Opinions No. 5/2020; No. 6/2020; No. 11/2020; No. 13/2020; No. 77/2020 and No. 38/2021. See also Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 35, para. 17.\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nwhereabouts of the persons concerned or to acknowledge their detention. This lacks any valid legal basis under any circumstance. Judicial oversight of any detention is a central safeguard for personal liberty and is critical in ensuring that detention has a legitimate basis. In the circumstances attending the detention of Mr. Kanu at an unknown location, the Working Group finds that his right to an effective remedy under article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 2 (3) of the Covenant were violated. He was also placed outside the protection of the law, in violation of his right to be recognised as a person before the law under article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 16 of the Covenant.\n\n42. The Working Group also considers that Mr. Kanu\u2019s time in detention following his arrest constitutes pre-trial detention, which violated the prescriptions of article 9 (3) of the Covenant in so far as Mr. Kanu was not presented before a judicial authority within 48 hours and no individual assessment of the appropriateness of his pre-trial detention took place.\n\n43. The source asserts and the Government does not contest that on or about 29 June 2021, Mr. Kanu was subjected to extraordinary rendition to Abuja, Nigeria, with no prior judicial hearing before a judicial or administrative body. The source emphasizes that Mr. Kanu was not given access to counsel and was denied any judicial proceedings all together whilst in Kenya. The source notes that, according to Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Mr. Kanu was apprehended and transported to Abuja with the cooperation of Nigerian intelligence officials and Interpol.\n\n44. The source claims that, in the present case, there was no fair and public hearing concerning Mr. Kanu\u2019s removal from Kenya to Nigeria. The source stresses that involuntary expulsion to a foreign State without a hearing by judicial authorities does not conform with due process considerations.8\n\n45. It is clear from the facts as narrated by the source and not contested by the Government that Mr. Kanu was never presented to a court before leaving Nairobi. Instead, he was unwillingly taken, outside any legal process and without any legal protection. He was forcibly conveyed from Nairobi to Abuja under an arrangement between the Kenyan and Nigerian Governments, and with the cooperation of the Nigerian Intelligence officials and Interpol, as confirmed by Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General.\n\n46. As the Working Group has previously observed 9 international law regarding extradition provides procedures that must be observed by countries in arresting, detaining and returning individuals to face criminal proceedings in another country and in ensuring that their right to a fair trial is protected. This is also an explicating obligation arising from article 13 of the Covenant which requires that the person who is to be expelled \u201cbe allowed to submit the reasons against his expulsion and to have his case reviewed by, and be represented for the purpose before, the competent authority or a person or persons especially designated by the competent authority\u201d. The Working Group finds that all these requirements were ignored in the present case and the removal of Mr. Kanu from Kenya amounted to extraordinary rendition.\n\n47. As the Working Group has explained, the practice of so-called \u201crenditions\u201d, because it is aimed at avoiding all procedural safeguards, is not compatible with international law.10 The Working Group has previously found a violation of article 9 of the Covenant and the detention to be arbitrary where individuals were transferred to another country outside the confines of any legal procedure, such as extradition, were not allowed access to counsel or to any judicial body to contest the transfers.11 This is precisely what happened to Mr. Kanu in the present case. The Working Group therefore finds that Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest and transfer to Nigeria lacked a legal basis and due process of law, in violation of article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 9 of the Covenant.\n\n48. Further, the Working Group notes that this was preceded by the secret detention of Mr. Kanu. As the Working Group and other experts have stated regarding State responsibility\n\n. 8 Opinion No. 42/2020, para 64.\n\n\n\n. 9 A/HRC/48/55 paras 51-60.

The practice of \u201cproxy detention\u201d, where persons are transferred from one State to another outside the realm of any international or national legal procedure (\u201crendition\u201d or \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d) for the specific purpose of secretly detaining them, or to exclude the possibility of review by the domestic courts of the State having custody of the detainee, or otherwise in violation of the well-entrenched principle of non-refoulement, entails exactly the same consequence. The practice of \u201cproxy detention\u201d involves the responsibility of both the State that is detaining the victim and the State on whose behalf or at whose behest the detention takes place.12\n\n49.\n\nshould be held in secret detention and urged States to ensure that all persons held in detention under their authority were provided with access to the courts and to investigate all alleged cases of secret detention, including under the pretext of counterterrorism.13\n\n50. For the reasons articulated, the Working Group finds that the Government of Kenya failed to establish a legal basis for Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention. His detention and extraordinary rendition to Nigeria was thus arbitrary under category I.\n\nCategory II\n\n51. The source submits and the Government has chosen not to contest that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Kanu, a citizen of the United Kingdom, was a resident of Nairobi, Kenya. He was an activist and the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, an organisation founded in 2012 with the objective of securing a referendum for a Biafran sovereignty, independent from Nigeria. Mr. Kanu became a political opponent in the diaspora, opposed to the Nigerian Government\u2019s repression of political dissent and freedom as it relates to the issue of Biafra.\n\n52. Noting that the Kenyan Government failed to provide any reason for Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest and detention, the Working Group concludes that his deprivation of liberty resulted from the exercise of universally recognized human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Given that Mr. Kanu was critical of the Nigerian Government\u2019s position on the issue of Biafra, his arrest and detention by the Kenyan Government can be interpreted as a calculated move in cooperation with the Government of Nigeria to curb his dissent.\n\n53. Freedom of opinion and expression are fundamental human rights enshrined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 19 of the Covenant.14 The Governments of Kenya and Nigeria have a duty to respect, protect and fulfil the right to hold and express opinions, including those that are not in accordance with their official policy, and to think and manifest personal convictions at odds with the Governments\u2019 official ideology, under the peremptory norms of customary international law15.\n\n54. The Working Group considers that Mr. Kanu\u2019s criticism of the Government of Nigeria\u2019s position on the Biafra question is protected under his right to freedom of opinion and expression and cannot be the basis for the deprivation of liberty. The Working Group recalls that detention purely due to the peaceful exercise of rights protected by the Covenant may be arbitrary.16 It also recalls that the freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and that this right includes the expression and receipt of communications of every form of idea and opinion capable of transmission to others, including political opinions.17\n\nA/HRC/13/42, para. 36.\n\nSee A/HRC/37/L.11/Rev.1, paras. 8\u20139.\n\nSee Human Rights Committee, CCPR/C/78/D/878/1999, para. 7.2.\n\nSee Opinions No. 94/2017, para. 59; No. 88/2017, para. 32; No. 83/2017, para. 80; and No. 76/2017, para. 62.\n\nGeneral comment No. 35, paras 17 and 53.\n\nIbid., para. 11.\n\nMoreover, in its resolution 37/3, the Human Rights Council stressed that no one\n\n8\n\n12 13 14 15\n\n16 17\n\niii.\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\n55. Similarly, Resolution 12/16 called on States to refrain from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with article 19 (3), including on the discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human rights; engaging in peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or democracy; and the expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief.18\n\n56. In the present case, the Government of Kenya has presented no exceptions permitted under article 19 (3) of the Covenant nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Kanu\u2019s exercise of his freedom of opinion and expression was anything but peaceful. The Working Group therefore concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention was arbitrary under category II.\n\nCategory III\n\n57. Given the findings of the Working Group under category II, no arrest, detention or trial of Mr. Kanu should have taken place. However, Mr. Kanu was arrested, subjected to extraordinary rendition and trial proceedings against him are ongoing in Nigeria. The source has made numerous submissions concerning Mr. Kanu\u2019s fair trial rights violations in both Kenya and Nigeria.\n\n58. The source has alleged that Mr. Kanu was denied access to counsel throughout his detention in Kenya and especially during his removal to Nigeria. The Government of Kenya has not contested these submissions.\n\n59. The Working Group considers legal representation a core facet of the right to a fair trial and an essential guarantee against arbitrary detention. Legal assistance must be available at all stages of criminal proceedings, namely during pre-trial, trial, and appellate stages, to ensure compliance with fair trial guarantees.19 Denial of access to lawyers substantially undermines and compromises the ability of accused individuals to defend themselves in any judicial proceedings. Principle 18 (3) of the Body of Principles and rule 61 (1) of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), stipulate that defendants must have access to legal counsel without delay.\n\n60. This was clearly denied to Mr. Kanu and the Working Group therefore finds a violation of article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant. The Working Group views this violation as particularly grave given its findings of extraordinary rendition of Mr. Kanu to Nigeria and the subsequent violations of his rights there (see below).\n\n61. Further, the Working Group recalls that in terms of article 36 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which both Kenya and Nigeria are parties, consular assistance ought to be provided for those detained in a foreign country. Additionally, Principle 16 (2) of the Body of Principles recognizes the right of a detained foreign national to \u201ccommunicate by appropriate means with a consular post of the diplomatic mission of the State of which he [or she] is a national.\u201d The Nelson Mandela Rules also provide that \u201c[p]risoners who are foreign nationals shall be allowed reasonable facilities to communicate with the diplomatic and consular representatives of the State to which they belong.\u201d\n\n62. Although Mr. Kanu is a British citizen, Kenyan authorities failed to inform British authorities of his detention in Kenya or provide Mr. Kanu an opportunity to communicate with British authorities. They did not inform him of his right to communicate with a British consular officer either or facilitate such communication. The Working Group considers that the Government of Kenya\u2019s failure to respect Mr. Kanu\u2019s right to consular protection under customary international law, as codified in article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, during his initial arrest and detention, violates article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 of the Covenant and principle 16 (2) of the Body of Principles.\n\nSee also General comment No. 34.\n\nA/HRC/45/16, paras 51-53; see also the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines, principle 9 and guideline 8.\n\n18 19\n\n9\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nb.\n\n63. Furthermore, the Working Group notes with grave concern the uncontested allegations regarding the treatment to which Mr. Kanu was subjected during his enforced disappearance in Kenya following his arrest.\n\n64. The Working Group\u2019s mandate extends to alleged ill-treatment that negatively affects the ability of detainees to prepare their defence as well as their chances of a fair trial,20 and the burden is on the Government to prove that any statement made by Mr. Kanu was given freely.21 Although it is not clear what, if any, statements Mr. Kanu gave as a result of the deplorable treatment he was subjected to, the Working Group considers this irrelevant. Following such treatment, any proceedings against Mr. Kanu became tainted, unfair and unjust and incompatible with the fundamental requirements of article 14 (1) and (3) of the Covenant. The Working Group makes this finding particularly noting the extraordinary rendition to which Mr. Kanu was subjected to.\n\n65. The Working Group thus concludes that the arrest and detention of Mr. Kanu in Kenya violated his fair trial rights and was therefore arbitrary under category III.\n\n66. Finally, the Working Group must address the collusion between the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria that resulted in Mr. Kanu\u2019s rendition to Nigeria. Indeed, it has already been affirmed by Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General that Kenyan authorities colluded with the Nigerian authorities, which resulted in Mr. Kanu\u2019s rendition to Nigeria and the Working Group has established such collusion in the present Opinion too. The Working Group therefore finds that the Government of Kenya is jointly responsible with the Government of Nigeria for the arrest, detention, and extraordinary rendition of Mr. Kanu to Nigeria as well as for any violations of his rights that took place in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nAllegations in relation to Nigeria\n\n67. The Working Group thanks the Government for its reply albeit short and only stating that since the proceedings against Mr. Kanu are on-going in national courts, \u201cany reaction by the Federal Government of Nigeria will be unconscionable\u201d.\n\n68. In this regard, as a preliminary issue, the Working Group wishes to clarify that the procedural rules applicable to communications from sources and responses of Governments are contained in its methods of work22 and in no other international instrument that the parties might consider applicable. Its methods of work contain no applicable rule impeding the consideration of communications due to the lack of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the country concerned. Sources have no obligation therefore to exhaust domestic remedies before sending a communication to the Working Group23 and equally nothing prevents the Working Group from engaging with the allegations of arbitrary detention in cases when the national proceedings are still on-going.\n\n69. Turing to the substance of the allegations, the source reports that following his rendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was reportedly detained in solitary confinement within the headquarters of the Department of State Security Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) in Abuja, Nigeria, before the Federal Government of Nigeria. He was initially charged with four offenses: conspiracy to commit treasonable felony in 2014 and 2015, treasonable felony in 2014 and 2015, defamation in 2015, and improper importation of goods in 2015 all of which the source claims related to old events. These charges were later amended to include accusations of levying war against Nigeria in 2015, through a radio broadcast from London.\n\n70. According to the source, a hearing scheduled to take place on 26 July 2021 was adjourned to 21 October 2021 as the authorities failed to produce Mr. Kanu in court and did not give any reason for such failure. On 21 October 2021, the Department reportedly blocked all traffic to the courthouse where the hearing on Mr. Kanu\u2019s motion to dismiss was to take place. As a result, Mr. Kanu\u2019s legal team was forced to walk more than one mile to be able\n\nSee e.g. Opinion No. 47/2017, para. 28 and No. 29/2017, para. 63.

An array of armed forces allegedly surrounded the courthouse creating an atmosphere of intimidation and danger.\n\n71. The source narrates that even after the court ordered access to Mr. Kanu to his lawyers, his legal team was ill-treated and made to wait for over an hour while his international lawyer was not allowed to visit his client because he was a foreigner. The authorities also reportedly informed the legal team that the key to the locked visitation room could not be retrieved and thus, no person would be able to visit Mr. Kanu on a day directed by the court. As a result, Mr. Kanu\u2019s attorneys were unable to meet with their client.\n\n72. On 10 November 2021, a hearing reportedly took place before the Federal High Court of Nigeria in Abuja to address Mr. Kanu\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended charges. The Department singled out Mr. Kanu\u2019s international lawyer from other attorneys present and denied him entry into the courtroom for the fifth time, without any explanation. As a result, Mr. Kanu\u2019s attorneys boycotted the hearing. Without communicating with any of Mr. Kanu\u2019s lawyers, the judge of the Federal High Court of Nigeria consulted privately with the prosecutors and adjourned the case until 19 January 2022.\n\n73. All these very serious allegations were put to the Government which chose not to address the substance of any of them.\n\nCategory I\n\n74. According to the source, following the rendition of Mr. Kanu from Kenya to Nigeria on or about 29 June 2021, Nigerian authorities took custody of Mr. Kanu without producing any warrant.\n\n75. The Working Group has already stated (see para. 36 above) that a detention in the absence of an arrest warrant as well as in the absence of any explanation for the reasons for arrest violates articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 of the Covenant, and principles 2, 4 and 10 of the Body of Principles. Since this also took place in Nigeria following the forcible transfer of Mr. Kanu there, the Working Group finds a further violation of these rights by the Government of Nigeria.\n\n76. Similarly, the Working Group reiterates its discussion (paras 37-38) concerning the requirement under article 9 (2) of the Covenant that anyone who is arrested is not only informed of the reasons for arrest but also promptly informed of any charges against them. These rights were further violated by the Nigerian authorities, in violation of article 9 (2) of the Covenant.\n\n77. In the present case, Mr. Kanu was not furnished with an arrest warrant by Nigerian authorities nor was he promptly informed of the grounds for his arrest in Nigeria. Consequently, the Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu\u2019s continued deprivation of liberty violates his rights under articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 of the Covenant, and principles 2, 4, and 10 of the Body of Principles and constitutes arbitrary detention under category I.\n\n78. Turning to the uncontested allegations that following his rendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu remained in pre-trial detention with his trial having been scheduled to commence in January 2022, the Working Group recalls that it is a well-established norm of international law that pre-trial detention should be the exception rather than the rule, and should be ordered for the shortest time possible. 24 Put differently, liberty is recognised under article 9 (3) of the Covenant as the core consideration with detention merely as an exception.25 Therefore, detention pending trial must be based on an individualised determination that it is reasonable and necessary for such purposes as to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the recurrenceofcrime.26 Suchdeterminationwasnotcarriedoutinthepresentcase,inviolation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\nOpinions No. 49/2014, para. 23; No. 1/2020, para. 53; No. 8/2020, para. 54; and No. 5/2021, para. 43. See also Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 35, para. 38; and A/HRC/19/57, paras. 48\u2013 58.\n\nA/HRC/19/57, para. 54.\n\nGeneral comment No. 35, para. 38.\n\n24\n\n25 26\n\n11\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nii.\n\n79. Further, in accordance with article 9 (3) of the Covenant, an arrested person is to be brought before a judge within 48 hours.27 This was not satisfied in the case of Mr. Kanu and the Working Group therefore finds a violation of articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 9 (3) of the Covenant and principles 11, 37 and 38 of the Body of Principles.\n\n80. Furthermore, in order to establish that a detention is indeed legal, anyone detained has the right to challenge the legality of his or her detention before a court, as guaranteed by article 9 (4) of the Covenant. The Working Group wishes to recall that according to the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedies and Procedures on the Rights of Anyone Deprived of their Liberty to Bring Proceedings before a Court, the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court is a self-standing human right, which is essential to preserve legality in a democratic society.28 This right, which is in fact a peremptory norm of international law, applies to all forms of deprivation of liberty,29 to \u201call situations of deprivation of liberty, including not only to detention for purposes of criminal proceedings but also to situations of detention under administrative and other fields of law, including military detention, security detention, detention under counter-terrorism measures\u201d.30 Moreover, it also applies \u201cirrespective of the place of detention or the legal terminology used in the legislation. Any form of deprivation of liberty on any ground must be subject to effective oversight and control by the judiciary\u201d.31 This was also denied to Mr. Kanu, thus violating his right under article 9 (4) of the Covenant.\n\n81. Finally, turning to Mr. Kanu\u2019s pre-trial detention in Nigeria, the Working Group recalls that according to international human rights law, in particular article 9 (3) of the Covenant, any person detained while awaiting trial is entitled to trial within a reasonable time, or otherwise shall be released. Article 14 (3) (c) of the Covenant also guarantees the right of anyone charged with a criminal offence to be tried without undue delay. In the absence of a substantive response from the Government of Nigeria, the Working Group finds no legitimate grounds for the delays in the trials against Mr. Kanu.32\n\n82. Consequently, the Working Group finds that the Government of Nigeria failed to establish a legal basis for the detention of Mr. Kanu. His detention is thus arbitrary under category I. The Working Group wishes once again to underscore the collusion between the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria in the rendition of Mr. Kanu and reiterates that both Governments bear joint responsibility for any violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nCategory II\n\n83. The Working Group has already established in its discussion of the detention of Mr. Kanu in Kenya that he was arrested and detained due to the peaceful exercise of his rights (see paras 52-54 above). The Working Group notes that the source has argued the same in relation to Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest, detention and trial proceedings in Nigeria. Notably, the Government of Nigeria has chosen not to address the substance of these allegations.\n\n84. The Working Group notes that it is not contested that Mr. Kanu is accused of the crime of conspiracy to commit a treasonable felony through an agreement with others to be broadcasted from London, in view of the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty. The source notes that, while treason consists of \u201clevying war\u201d against Nigeria under Nigerian law, the Federal Government of Nigeria does not allege any action implicating Mr. Kanu in the contemplation, planning, or incitement of war against Nigeria. The source argues that Mr. Kanu was in fact advocating for a peaceful referendum for the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty, in conformity with international and other relevant laws.\n\nIbid., paras. 32-33.\n\nA/HRC/30/37 at paras 2 and 3. A/HRC/30/37 at para 11.\n\nA/HRC/30/37 at para 47 (a). A/HRC/30/37 at para 47 (b).\n\nSee Opinions Nos. 16/2020 and 10/2021.\n\n12\n\n27 28 29 30 31 32\n\niii.\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\n85. Noting the failure of the Government to explain what actions of Mr. Kanu amounted to such criminal acts and how, and observing the lack of any evidence that any of his actions may in fact amount to such crimes, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu is in fact being persecuted for the peaceful exercise of his rights, most notably his freedom of opinion and expression.\n\n86. Similarly to what the Working Group noted in relation to the Government of Kenya, it reiterates that detention purely due to the peaceful exercise of rights protected by the Covenant may be arbitrary.33 The Working Group recalls that freedom of opinion and expression, as expressed in article 19 of the Covenant, is an indispensable condition for the full development of the person. It is essential for any society and constitutes the foundation stone for every free and democratic society.34 It also recalls that freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and that this right includes the expression and receipt of communications of every form of idea and opinion capable of transmission to others, including political opinions.35\n\n87. Similarly, in Resolution 12/16, the Human Rights Council called on States to refrain from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with article 19 (3), including on the discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human rights; engaging in peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief.36\n\n88. In the present case, the Government of Nigeria has presented no exceptions permitted under article 19 (3) of the Covenant nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Kanu\u2019s exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression was anything but peaceful. In fact, the Government has chosen not to provide any explanation for the arrest, detention and subsequent proceedings against Mr. Kanu. In these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II.\n\nCategory III\n\n89. The source has submitted, and the Government did not address, that Mr. Kanu was denied effective legal representation. The Working Group considers legal representation as being a core facet of the right to a fair trial. Legal assistance should be available at all stages of criminal proceedings, namely, pre-trial, trial, and appellate stages, to ensure compliance with fair trial guarantees.37 Any denial of access to lawyers substantially undermines and compromises an accused individual\u2019s capacity to defend him or herself in any judicial proceedings.\n\n90. As the Working Group has stated in principle 9 and guideline 8 of its Basic Principles, persons deprived of their liberty have the right to legal assistance by counsel of their choice, at any time during their detention, including immediately after the moment of apprehension, and must be promptly informed of this right upon apprehension. Access to legal counsel should not be unlawfully or unreasonably restricted.38\n\n91. Article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant entitles defendants to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence and to communicate with counsel of their own choosing. Defendants must have access to documents and other evidence, including \u201call materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that could assist the defence.\u201d It further requires that defendants \u201cbe able to meet their clients in private and to communicate with the accused in conditions that fully respect the confidentiality of their communications.\u201d39\n\nGeneral comment No. 35, paras 17 and 53.\n\nGeneral comment No. 34, para. 2.\n\nIbid., para. 11.\n\nSee also general comment No. 34.\n\nA/HRC/45/16, paras 51-53; see also the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines, principle 9 and guideline 8.\n\nA/HRC/30/37, annex, paras 12-15 and 67-71. See also general comment no. 32, para. 34. General comment No. 32, paras 33-34.\n\n33 34 35 36 37\n\n38 39\n\n13\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\n92. Recalling general comment No. 32, a detainee has the right to have \u201cprompt access\u201d to legal counsel, meaning that a lawyer must be able to have private communications and meetings with the detainee and be able to attend all the investigations without interference or restrictions. A detainee also ought to have access to \u201ceffective counsel.\u201d The effectiveness of the legal counsel is fundamentally related to the principle of equality of arms, as enshrined in article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which draws on the right of detainees to be afforded the time and facilities necessary to prepare and present their defence with the counsel of their own choosing.\n\n93. All of this was denied to Mr. Kanu. In the Working Group\u2019s view, by failing to allow Mr. Kanu to be represented by lawyers of his choice, including an international counsel,40 the Government denied Mr. Kanu\u2019s right to legal assistance at all times, which is inherent in the right to liberty and security of the person as well as the right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, in accordance with articles 3, 9, 10 and 11 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 14 of the Covenant, articles 37 (b) and (d) and 40 (2) (b) (ii) and principles 15, 17 and 18 of the Body of Principles and principles 1, 5, 7, 8, 21 and 22 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers.\n\n94. The Working Group is also disturbed by the source\u2019s report of the treatment of Mr. Kanus\u2019s lawyers and recalls its jurisprudence highlighting that such treatment of lawyers is entirely unacceptable and violates articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant.41 It is the legal and positive duty of the State to protect everyone on its territory or under its jurisdiction against any human rights violation and to provide remedy whenever a violation still occurs.42 The Working Group recalls that principle 9 of the United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedies and Procedures on the Right of Anyone Deprived of their Liberty to Bring Proceedings Before a Court states that legal counsels are to be able to carry out their functions effectively and independently, free from fear of reprisal, interference, intimidation, hindrance or harassment.43\n\n95. The Working Group also considers that Mr. Kanu\u2019s presumption of innocence was violated as the Department surrounded the court complex with an array of armed forces, creating an atmosphere of intimidation and danger (see para. 9), a submission which the Government has chosen not to contest. The Working Group recalls that defendants should not be presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals, as this also undermines the presumption of innocence.44 The Working Group finds a breach of article 14 (2) of the Covenant.\n\n96. Further, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following his rendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquarters of the Department in Abuja, Nigeria. He is reportedly currently still held in a very small cell where he is exposed to daily psychological and mental torture without access to other inmates or any other person except for the Department officers. Mr. Kanu is also allegedly denied access to reading or writing materials and has been refused access to professional medical care despite a serious heart ailment. The source reports that Mr. Kanu\u2019s life is in jeopardy and that he suffers from a medical condition occasioned by gradual depletion of potassium in his system, which has defied any medical solution given to him within the Department facilities.\n\n97. The Working Group is seriously concerned about the treatment to which Mr. Kanu has been subjected. Especially noting its finding that Mr. Kanu was subjected to extraordinary rendition as well as his treatment prior to that, the Working Group considers it unlikely that Mr. Kanu would have been able to effectively assist with and participate in his own defence during the proceedings against him, and that such treatment tainted the\n\n. 40 See Opinion No. 55/2020, para 78.\n\n\n\n. 41 Opinions No. 14/2017; No. 29/2017; No. 32/2017; No. 34/2017; No. 36/2017; No. 70/2017; No.\n\n28/2018; No. 66/2019 and No. 42/2020.

For all the reasons above, the Working Group finds that the fair trial rights and procedural guarantees of Mr. Kanu under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant and other relevant human rights standards, were not observed and that such violations are of such gravity as to render Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention arbitrary under category III.\n\niv. Category V\n\n98. Mr. Kanu is an activist and the leader of the organisation Indigenous People of Biafra, which he founded in 2012. The source alleges that the Government of Nigeria is targeting Mr. Kanu due to his political expression, in particular, due to his membership in a group politically opposed to the Nigerian Government on the question of Biafra, his widely published criticism of the Government, and his work with and advocacy for the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Government has chosen not to address these allegations.\n\n99. The Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu has indeed been targeted by the Government as a human rights defender on account of his freedom of opinion and expression as well as his position regarding the sovereignty of Biafra. As Mr. Kanu has been targeted on account of his activism in galvanising momentum for a referendum on the sovereignty of Biafra, the Working Group considers that his detention violates articles 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2 (1) and 26 of the Covenant, and is arbitrary under category V.\n\nc. Concluding remarks\n\n100. The Working Group wishes to record its very serious concern for the well-being of Mr. Kanu, who, according to the source and uncontested by the Government of Nigeria, remains in solitary confinement since his arbitrary detention in Nigeria on 29 June 2021. He has been denied medical treatment and medication for his heart condition. The Working Group recalls that prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 consecutive days is prohibited under rules 43(1)(b) and 44 of the Mandela Rules. The Working Group is also obliged to remind the Government of Nigeria that in accordance with article 10 of the Covenant, all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect to the inherent dignity of the human person and that denial of medical assistance constitutes a violation of the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 24, 25, 27 and 30 in particular.\n\n101. According to the source, throughout Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention in Kenya and transfer to Nigeria, no family members knew about his location or could access him, and Mr. Kanu was not permitted to contact his family during this detention. These allegations have not been contested by either Governments. The Working Group stresses that, under international human rights law, all detained and imprisoned individuals have the right to communicate and be visited by their families. The right to receive visits applies to all detainees, \u201cregardless of the offence of which they are suspected or accused.\u201d Under Principle 19 of the Body of Principles, this right could be subject only to conditions and restrictions that are appropriate to a legitimate aim. Neither Governments have argued that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family conformed with this requirement. As a result, the Working Group finds that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family violated his right to contact with the outside world under rules 43 (3) and 58 (1) of the Nelson Mandela Rules and principles 15 and 19 of the Body of Principles.\n\n102. Noting the treatment to which Mr. Kanu has been subjected at the hands of both Kenyan and Nigerian authorities as well as his continued solitary confinement, the Working Group refers this case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration.\n\n103. The Working Group also wishes to reemphasize its very serious concern over the apparent collusion between the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria in this case and reiterates its findings that both Governments are jointly responsible for the violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in both jurisdictions.\n\n104. The present Opinion concerns solely the treatment and rights of Mr. Kanu and is adopted without any prejudice to the status of Biafra.\n\n15\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\nDisposition\n\n105. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion:\n\nIn relation to Kenya and Nigeria\n\nThe deprivation of liberty of Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu, being in contravention of articles 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within Categories I, II, III and V.\n\n106. The Working Group requests the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria to take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr. Kanu without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms, including those set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n107. The Working Group considers that, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the appropriate remedy would be for the Government of Nigeria to release Mr. Kanu immediately and for both Governments to accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law. In the current context of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the threat that it poses in places of detention, the Working Group calls upon the Government of Nigeria to take urgent action to ensure the immediate unconditional release of Mr. Kanu.\n\n108. The Working Group urges the two Governments to ensure a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Kanu and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of his rights.\n\n109. In accordance with paragraph 33 (a) of its methods of work, the Working Group refers the present case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, for appropriate action.\n\n110. The Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.\n\nFollow-up procedure\n\n111. In accordance with paragraph 20 of its methods of work, the Working Group requests the source and the Governments to provide it with information on action taken in follow-up to the recommendations made in the present opinion, including:\n\n. (a) Whether Mr. Kanu has been released and, if so, on what date;\n\n\n\n. (b) Whether compensation or other reparations have been made to Mr. Kanu;\n\n\n\n. (c) Whether an investigation has been conducted into the violation of Mr. Kanu\n\n\n\nrights and, if so, the outcome of the investigation;\n\n(d) Whether any legislative amendments or changes in practice have been made to harmonize the laws and practices of Kenya and Nigeria with its international obligations in line with the present opinion;\n\n(e) Whether any other action has been taken to implement the present opinion.\n\n112. The Government is invited to inform the Working Group of any difficulties it may have encountered in implementing the recommendations made in the present opinion and whether further technical assistance is required, for example through a visit by the Working Group.\n\n113. The Working Group requests the source and the Government to provide the above- mentioned information within six months of the date of transmission of the present opinion. However, the Working Group reserves the right to take its own action in follow-up to the opinion if new concerns in relation to the case are brought to its attention. Such action would enable the Working Group to inform the Human Rights Council of progress made in implementing its recommendations, as well as any failure to take action.\n\n16\n\nADVANCE UNEDITED VERSION A/HRC/WGAD/2022/25\n\n114. The Working Group recalls that the Human Rights Council has encouraged all States to cooperate with the Working Group and has requested them to take account of its views and, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, and to inform the Working Group of the steps they have taken.45\n\n[Adopted on 4 April 2022]",

          "text": "From George Onyejiuwa, Owerri\n\nThe Ubahaoji Otulu community in Oru West Local Government Area of Imo State was thrown into mourning last Sunday, July 17 when 14 of their young men were massacred by operatives whose identity has become a subject of controversy.\n\nWhile the Otutu youths believe that it was Ebubeagu, the Imo State government security outfit, that killed their brothers who they claimed were returning to their community from Awomama after the traditional wedding of one of their kinsmen, Chijioke Nnanna, the government said that it was the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) that killed some bandits in their camp.\n\nBut the killing of the youths has caused great bedlam across the state, leading to a two-day mass protest by all the communities in Oru West who barricaded the ever-busy Owerri/Onitsha road with the corpses of the deceased as they called for the scrapping of the Ebubeagu and the immediate arrest of Mr Izuchukwu Akuegbulanwa (Ogwu Mozambique), who they accused of masterminding the attack and killing.\n\nThey also accused Governor Hope Uzodimma of using the Ebubeagu, which they described as his militia, to intimidate the people of the state, especially in Orlu zone in the guise of fighting insecurity.\n\nIndeed, the DSS had claimed that seven of the young men who they branded as members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the militant wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), were killed during a duel in a sting operation in one of the camps of the IPOB/ESN in Awomama, where they were allegedly planning how to enforce a Monday sit-at-home in the area.\n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the DSS, Imo State Command said: \u201cFollowing the arrest of one Chinonso Mmerem (Network), a member of the IPOB militant wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), a sting operation was conducted by a joint security team on 17 July, 2022 to arrest members of the criminal gang terrorizing Awo \u2013 Omama and other parts of the state .\n\n\u201c In course of the operation, elements opened fire on the security forces which consequently repelled with a superior power leading to the neutralization of about seven members of the criminal gang in the hideout used as their camp. At this juncture, it is pertinent to inform that the elements gathered to plan their nefarious operations and not attending a traditional marriage as being speculated by members of the outlawed group.\u201d\n\nBut one of the survivors of the killing, Nnamdi Kingsley Nnanna, elder brother of Chijioke Nnanna, accused the security agents of trying to cover up their heinous crime by branding them members of the IPOB/ ESN.\n\nHe said that the killed 14 youths were returning to their Otulu community from Awo \u2013 Umubuochi, when the operatives of Ebubeagu opened fire on them.\n\nThe distraught Nnamdi disclosed that he had escaped death by the whiskers after having pleaded with the commander of the Ebubeagu popularly known as Ogwu Mozambique who he had recognised that Sunday night.\n\nHe added that one of the commanders who had intervened on his behalf having heard what he said had warned the others that nobody should shoot him, saying that he was an innocent person after they had already killed the two persons with him on the motorcycle .\n\nNnamdi who spoke to this reporter amidst sobs disclosed that after his younger brother\u2019s traditional wedding at Umubuochi Awo, Awomama community, Oru East council, three motorcycles conveying his other kinsmen back to Otulu had taken off while himself and another of his kinsman boarded the fourth motorcycle.\n\nHe claimed that just about three poles after they left their in- law\u2019s place that Ebubeagu people suddenly emerged on the road and opened fire and killed his brothers like fowls, adding that they had to reverse immediately as he told the motorcyclist to take them back to their in-law\u2019s house.\n\nNnamdi said that even as they were scampering for safety that the Ebubeagu members who were chasing them with their Hilux were at the same time shooting at the them.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that they had blocked the road with a truck, the motorcyclist who was on top speed hit a convert and the person sitting at my back, he is from Agwa in Oguta and lives in Otulu; he went with us to the wedding, fell off the motorcycle. The Ebubeagu people who caught up with him while still on the ground shot him dead immediately. My brother, Chikereuba Anyadioha, who was carrying us with the bike was shot on his hand and as a result we both fell off the motorcycle.\n\n\u201cThe Ebubeagu people also shot him dead. But I was shouting on top of my voice that I am from Otulu and not Awo, that we only came for the traditional wedding of my brother. About eight men came out from the Hilux that has been chasing us, they all cocked their riffles. One of them hit my head with his riffle and I fell flat on the ground. When I raised up my face I recognised Ogwu Mozambique who is the team leader of the Ebubeagu from Amiri. I called him \u2018Ogwu na Amiri\u2019 that I am your in-law because one of his sisters is married in my community, I told him that he knew I\u2019m a borehole driller and was among those who had drilled the borehole in his compound. It was then one of them said don\u2019t shot him and repeated that anybody who shot this boy this night will have problem with him ,\u201d Nnamdi said.\n\nHe claimed that he was later bond hand and foot, blind-folded with his cloth, thrown into their truck at about 12:30a.m and taken to their camp at Omuma, the council headquarters of Oru -East.\n\n\u201cIt was at their camp that I saw one of my brothers, Diri Uchenna who had taught me the borehole drilling work and he was surprised that I was alive. He told me that all our brothers who attended the wedding were all dead. He said that they were arrested by Ebubeagu for trying to carry the dead bodies of their brothers killed that night.\n\n\u201cWhile at their camp, we were still pleading with Ogwu Mozambique that we are his in-laws that we only came to Awo for the traditional wedding of our younger brother, Chijioke Nnanna. Ogwu Mozambique now ordered that we should be put in the cell. About 5- 6 a.m on Monday they brought me out and one of the Ebubeagu commanders asked me where the wedding took place in Awo and I volunteered to take them there if they wanted. They also asked me the name of my community, I told them Otulu and I also told them that our Eze is Ifeanyichukwu\n\nOrji, Duruiheoma V. They also asked me if he was around and I said I don\u2019t know because I had just returned from an outside work where I had gone to drill a borehole on Saturday. They said I should take them first to our in-laws place in Awo . They put me in their Hilux, with a back up of four Hilux vans and we drove to our in-law\u2019s compound.\n\n\u201cHundreds of our youths were already there protesting and the bodies of seven of our brothers that were killed have been carried to the place. It was there that our youths knew that I was still alive as they have been searching for my corpse. But because of the army people who were already there trying to maintain peace, the Ebubeagu people immediately drove out and we headed fpor my community Otulu. When we got to our Eze\u2019s palace, two of the Ebubeagu members went down to knock at his gate severally and, when nobody came out they drove me back to their camp at Omuma. Again that same man with Ebubeagu who said that nobody should shot this boy last night Sunday repeated it again that this boy is innocent and that nobody should touch me,\u201d he narrated.\n\nNnamdi disclosed that he was again detained at their cell with two of his kinsmen.\n\n\u201cMy major worry was because of my mother, we are only three, my elder brother died at 34 years and now I am being held by Ebubeagu not knowing what will happen next. I can\u2019t reach her to tell her that I am still alive because they seized all my phones.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later, that same person who said they should not shoot me came to our cell and asked all those who went to the wedding to come out and we did. Surprisingly, they gave us back our phones. The only thing I saw was my charger and bluetooth. One of the commanders asked how much was collected from me, I said N9,500 . Nnaemeka from Awo who also attended the wedding, the Ebubeagu members took his N10,500, gold necklace, finger ring and wristwatch. They only transferred N 20,000 to us. And we were asked to go, I think it was because of the protest by the communities in both Oru West and East, as they also realized that the people they killed were innocent people,\u201d Nnamdi said.\n\nChijioke Nnanna, the younger brother of Nnamdi Kingsley Nnanna who also spoke to this reporter said that his kinsmen had accompanied him to Awomama on Sunday being July 17, for his traditional wedding.\n\nHe said that his kinsmen who were returning to their community, Otulu, were attacked and killed by the members of Ebubeagu who tagged them members of ESN.\n\nHe also revealed that one of his brothers who was shot on his foot and had managed to crawl back to his in-law\u2019s compound was traced through his blood to the compound and shot dead.\n\nChijioke claimed that the members of the Ebubeagu also destroyed everything used for the wedding, including canopies, plastic chairs in his in-law\u2019s compound, adding that they also took away the car of his brother in-law who had returned from Abuja for the wedding, as well as that of his friend who came from Onitsha.\n\n\u201cA day that was supposed to be one of the happiest day of my life was turned into sorrowful day as members of Ebubeagu killed 14 persons, seven of who are my brothers who had accompanied me to Awomama for my traditional wedding.\n\n\u201cMy brothers had just finished eating and drinking and said they have to go back to the village because it was about 7:30p.m. But not quite about 15 minutes when they left that we began to hear the sounds of continuous shooting and everybody was wondering what was happening. Even people in the compound started running to find where to hide. Later one of our brothers who earlier left with the others managed to return back to my in-law\u2019s house because he was shot, but the Ebubeagu members had traced him because of blood dripping from his body and went to where he was hiding behind the GeePee tank and shot him dead.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t help him because of the continuous shooting because everybody was afraid to come out. The Ebubeagu members destroyed everything in the compound, including the things used in the traditional wedding,\u201d he said.\n\nHe disclosed that it was later in the morning when the army intervened that they were able to come out and realised that the Ebubeagu people had killed 14 people, seven of whom are their brothers and kinsmen who attended his traditional wedding.\n\nSimilarly, Chidozie Ekesinachi whose two siblings Chukuwuemeka, 20, and Ifechi, 18, were shot dead alongside others said on that fateful Sunday night, he was arrested and severely beaten by the Ebubeagu as he went in search of his siblings when heard of what happened.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to be at the traditional wedding, but I couldn\u2019t meet up because I went for an outside job. It was later in the evening about 8:00p.m when one of our brothers ran to our house to inform us that all our brothers who attended the Chijioke Nnanna\u2019s traditional wedding had been killed by Ebubeagu people.\n\n\u201cWe decided to go to Awo in search of my two siblings, Chukwuemeka and Ifechi, but around Afor-Awo we saw somebody lying on the road and when we looked closer it was my brother, Chukwuemeka who is an Aluminum fabricator and I fell on him crying.\n\n\u201cImmediately, the Ebubeagu people who were hiding something arrived with their Hilux van and their men started beating us that we have come to carry our members. While still crying I told them that he is my junior brother who went to our brother\u2019s wedding in Awo that Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that instead the Ebubeagu people tied them up and threw them into a truck they came with and took them to Omuma, their office and locked them up.\n\n\u201cIt was at their office in Omuma that I knew Nnamdi Nnanna was alive. While there, those who brought us started beating us again and later put us in their cell. It was in the morning about 6:00p.m that they asked us to go because of the protest of our youths over the killing of our people.\n\n\u201cLater I learnt that Ifechi was initially shot on his leg, but was later killed by the Ebubeagu people at the place where they had gone for the wedding as he had managed to return to Chijioke\u2019s in-law\u2019s house, asking for help.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma has vowed that his government would not be deterred by mere propaganda and blackmail in his quest to protect the lives and property of Imo citizens.\n\nHe said that the DSS director had confirmed that his men carried out the operation in a camp at Awomama with the assistance of their informant and not at a wedding place as claimed by the youths and that it was in the process that some bandits were neutralized.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nIn the run-up to the 2023 general elections, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders are intensifying efforts to appease Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike and other aggrieved members of the party.\n\nSunday Sun gathered that in the last three days, party leaders have held series of meetings on how best to resolve the issues arising from the nomination of Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the PDP 2023 vice presidential candidate.\n\nThe opposition party has been enmeshed in crisis since the emergence of Okowa as Atiku Abubakar\u2019s running mate as the nomination did not gone down well with Wike\u2019s supporters.\n\nConsequently, the Rivers State governor, as well as Governors Samuel Ortom, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Okezie Ikpeazu and Seyi Makinde of Benue, Enugu, Abia and Oyo states respectively, and their loyalists have stayed away from PDP functions.\n\nAlso, some party stakeholders, it was gathered, started shopping for a replacement of the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, over alleged bias in the processes leading to the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate and the running mate. Regardless, Ayu, through his spokesman, Simon Imobo-Tswam, has consistently denied the allegation.\n\nMultiple sources told Sunday Sun, yesterday, following Atiku\u2019s return from his foreign trip, party leaders have intensified efforts to pacify the Wike camp, as well as others, who have one grievance or another against the party.\n\nA source at the PDP National Secretariat told Sunday Sun that concerned party leaders met in Abuja on Thursday and Friday last week, to fashion out the best way to resolve the crisis in the party.\n\nHowever, the source noted that Wike\u2019s loyalists are still insisting on the replacement of Ayu as party chairman ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\n\u201cThey (stakeholders) meet on Thursday, Friday and this was to find the best way to reconcile all the differences. However, those people are insisting that Ayu must go,\u201d the source stated.\n\nThe source said the party\u2019s recent victory in Osun governorship election poll was being used for bargaining by Ayu\u2019s supporters.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOsun victory has strengthened the hands of Ayu as his supporters are using it as bargaining chips.\u00bb\n\nHe expressed optimism that very soon all the issues will be resolved.\n\nAnother source, who is close to one of the PDP governors, confirmed to Sunday Sun that efforts to resolve all the issues in the party have reached advanced stage.\n\nHe stated that the peace process will either be led by Atiku or any of the other top leaders of the party as PDP stakeholders opposed to Ayu at the moment would not be disposed to any peace panel set up by the party chairman.\n\nThe source noted that barring any last minute change, Atiku will meet with the Rivers State governor any moment from now.\n\nAccording to him, the Benue State governor is the intermediary between Atiku and Wike.\n\n\u201cOrtom is acting as the go-between Atiku and Wike. And Wike is ready to talk with the party candidate. Things are no longer as bad as people think. It was very bad at the beginning. Because Atiku was behaving as if he has gotten the presidency already. But things are being sorted out. Hopefully, soon all the issues will be resolved.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Atiku\u2019s media aide, Paul Ibe, confirmed to Sunday Sun that efforts to resolve all the issues in the party have been activated.",

          "text": "*Say disease common among male homosexuals\n\n*16,000 cases reported in 75 countries\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) on Saturday declared Monkey pox disease a public health emergency of international concern..\n\nA statement by the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at the Virtual Press Conference to update on the report of the 2nd meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee on the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox on Saturday said that the organisation was being compelled to declare health emergency on Monkey pox following its widespread.\n\nHe however expressed hope that the outbreak can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups since it is mostly transmitted among men who have sex with fellow men.\n\nHe also said that IHR committee was unable to reach a consensus on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cAlthough I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern, for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners.That means that this is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies in the right groups\u201d.\n\nGhebreyesus said that it was essential that all countries work closely with communities of men who have sex with men, to design and deliver effective information and services, and to adopt measures that protect the health, human rights and dignity of affected communities.\n\nHe also said that stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.\n\nIn addition to its recommendations to countries, WHO DG appealed to civil society organizations, including those with experience in working with people living with HIV, to join fighting stigma and discrimination.\n\nAccording to him the tools that are available now, can stop transmission and bring the epidemic outbreak under control.\n\n\u201cA month ago, I convened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to assess whether the multi-country monkeypox outbreak represented a public health emergency of international concern.\n\n\u201cAt that meeting, while differing views were expressed, the committee resolved by consensus that the outbreak did not represent a public health emergency of international concern.\n\n\u201cAt the time, 3040 cases of monkeypox had been reported to WHO, from 47 countries.\n\nSince then, the outbreak has continued to grow, and there are now more than 16 thousand reported cases from 75 countries and territories, and five deaths, he said.\n\nWHO DG said committee on health emergency summoned to review the Monkey Pox epidemic was unable to reach a consensus on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\n\n\u201cWe have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little, and which meets the criteria in the International Health Regulations.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nAccordingly, I have made a set of recommendations for four groups of countries,\u201d he said:\n\nThe DG said the reasons the committee members gave for and against were laid out in the report published on Saturday.\n\nHe further said that under the International Health Regulations, he was expected to consider five elements in deciding whether an outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern:\n\n\u201cFirst, the information provided by countries \u2013 which in this case shows that this virus has spread rapidly to many countries that have not seen it before;\n\nSecond, the three criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations, which have been met;\n\n\u201cThird, the advice of the Emergency Committee, which has not reached consensus;\n\nFourth, scientific principles, evidence and other relevant information \u2013 which are currently insufficient and leave us with many unknowns;\n\n\u201cAnd fifth, the risk to human health, international spread, and the potential for interference with international traffic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe statement said that WHO had concluded in its assessment that the risk of monkeypox was moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region where the risk is high.\n\n\u201cThere is also a clear risk of further international spread, although the risk of interference with international traffic remains low for the moment,\u201d he said\n\nWHO said it had established dashboard to provide a global overview of the monkeypox epidemiological situation as reported to WHO and will be updated daily.\n\nThe report said it focuses on confirmed cases as defined by the WHO\u2019s working case definition published in the Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for Monkeypox interim guidance.",

          "text": "Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nA former Spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, has said the northern electorate would vote against the party\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, for violating the zoning arrangement of the PDP.\n\nAdeyeye stated this in Abuja on Saturday at a news conference.\n\nThe former Ekiti South Senatorial District representative in the 9th National Assembly, said politicians and their followers in the North believe in zoning and were always ready to frustrate any arrangement meant to scuttle it.\n\nHe said the North moved against whatever plans by any political party to field northern candidate in the 1999 election in the interest of justice and fair play.\n\nThe development he explained, led to the emergence of two Yoruba men, Olusegun Obasanjo and Olu Falae as presidential candidates of the PDP and the All Progressives Party in the 1999 general elections which was won by the former.\n\nHe also said they rejected the attempt by former president Goodluck Jonathan to return to the State House in 2015 because of their belief in rotation since the South had ruled for 14 years then.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is an unwritten constitution among the nation\u2019s political leaders that power should rotate between the North and South.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this is that we are in a multi ethnic, multi religious society with over 250 ethnic groups. Also the administrative division of the country since almagamation has been between the North and South.\n\n\u201cThere is therefore a great sense in agreeing that power should rotate between the two divides in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is what informed the military leaders in 1998 to compel the two main political parties at that time, to pick their candidates from the South, especially from the South West.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the perceived injustice against the winner of the 1993 presidential election, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, and the fact that northern military rulers had been ruling after the polls\u2019 annulment.\n\n\u201cThe directive led to the emergence of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP and Chief Olu Falae (APP) and the election was won by the PDP candidate.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye also explained that Obasanjo ensured that the PDP fielded a northern candidate that would succeed him in 2007 despite the fact that the party paraded very strong candidates from the South.\n\nHe said that was why the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, became President.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut for Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s untimely death, he would have been in Power for eight years before the president would rotate to the south.\n\n\u201cBy that accident of history however, the reins of power was taken over by Jonathan who was Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s deputy. However, by the time Jonathan wanted to go for a second time in 2015, he was rejected and he lost the election.\n\nAdeyeye insisted that the matter that would decide the winner of the next year\u2019s presidential election is the issue of zoning and not the Muslim Muslim ticket.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe zoning arrangement which had been violated by the candidate of the PDP would determine the winner of next year\u2019s election and not the same faith ticket. The Muslim Muslim ticket is a distraction caused by the opposition against the candidate of the APC.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians are not too keen on the Muslim Muslim ticket. What is of the paramount importance to them is that it is about time that power should rotate to the South.\u201d\n\nHe faulted the argument of Atiku Abubakar who said the issue of zoning should be a political party affair.\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cAtiku\u2019s argument does not hold water because when a president emerge from a political party, he becomes the president of the country and not that of his political party.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are not more than 10 per cent of the population of the country. The entire populace would determine the issue of rotation not the politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe PDP elected a northerner as the national chairman in anticipation that Power would rotate to the South after president Buhari but Atiku betrayed Nigerians by contesting.\u201d",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said that the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has lost his moral compass.\n\nTinubu stated this in a statement issued by his Media aide, Mr. Tunde Rahman.\n\nHe said Atiku in his desperate attempt to win the election by stoking religious bias reduced himself to uttering baseless lies during his exclusive interview with Arise TV.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cWe are saddened to see such a man become unhinged from the truth. So obsessed is he with his quest for office, Atiku is willing to render any form of untruth if he thinks it might gain him a single vote. Atiku may want to be president. However, all he has shown is that he is pathological,\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever moral compass he had has been lost. During a 22 July television interview, Atiku assaulted historic truth by lying that he did not name Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the Action Congress ticket because Atiku did not want a Muslim as his running mate.\u201d\n\nResponding to the false account of Atiku, Tinubu set the record straight, saying the former Vice President Atiku was not among those who founded the Action Congress.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was the actual founders of the AC who offered the party\u2019s flag to Atiku because of the need to fight the authoritarian designs then President Obasanjo and the PDP had on Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, Atiku had been unceremoniously pushed aside if not out of the PDP by Obasanjo. We needed to rally all forces to confront the one-party state Obasanjo had in mind. Atiku was simply a beneficiary of this collective duty to fight the attack on multi-party democracy the PDP had launched.\n\n\u201c\ufeffI feel sorry for dear old Atiku. Love of his own ambition has eclipsed his relationship with the truth and an honest account of the past. We formed the AC without his knowledge. When President Obasanjo virtually exiled him from the PDP, we lent him our support by giving him the AC platform for the 2007 election.\n\n\u201cLet me say openly that Atiku offered me the vice presidential ticket in 2007. Let me also say that my religion has not changed. When he offered the position to me, I was a Muslim and I believe he was aware of my religious faith at the time.\u201d\n\nTinubu noted that Atiku\u2019s calculations and deceit had nothing to do with religion or his sensitivity to it, adding that his conduct has everything to do with what they discovered about his paucity of character and love of intrigue.\n\nHe said: \u201cTrue to form, Atiku, fifteen years later, promised HE Governor Nyesom Wike the same thing this electoral season and similarly reneged. Governor Wike is a Christian.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to intrigue, we can say that Atiku is without bias. He will attempt to lie and deceive both Christian and Muslim with equal vigour.\n\n\u201cAtiku has no business raising the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket except as a hypocrite. Perhaps he believes people have forgotten his antics during the 1993 election. After he woefully lost his bid to be the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, what did he do? He canvassed and lobbied harder than anyone to become the running mate to late Chief MKO Abiola. When it benefitted him personally, Atiku did not see anything wrong with Muslim-Muslim ticket. He saw everything right in such a ticket as long as he was on it.\n\n\u201cNow, Atiku criticizes my selection as running mate based on religion. He does so because he cannot criticize it on other grounds. If Atiku were to have one of his rare moments of honesty, he would admit that the person I selected as my running mate is more qualified for the position than the man who joined him. And this conclusion has nothing to do with religious faith. It has everything to do with competence, experience, ability, and vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy running mate and I are here to build a more just and prosperous society for all Nigerians, be they Christian, Muslim or adherents of other faiths. It seems that Atiku is here trying to build an edifice of lies and call that the house into which Nigerians should walk and reside. He will fail in this sad attempt to trick an entire nation.\n\n\u201cLet me restate my position on religion and politics. When I decided that Senator Shettima was the best selection as my running mate, I listened to and weighed in serious balance the advice received from a broad and representative array of wonderful Nigerians who deeply care about this nation and the path it must go.\n\n\u201cSome people counselled that I should select a Christian to garner support of the Christian community. Some said I should select a Muslim for a similar reason. I clearly could not do both. Both positions had merit and right on their side. But neither position expressed what was most right and needed for the moment in which we find ourselves and the nation.\u201d",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Nigeria to the UK with the Global Talent Visa",
          "text": "Japa (verb, /d\u0292a pa/, Nigeria): to leave one\u2019s home country in search of greener pastures.\n\nWhen writers Ope Adedeji and Chika Jones decided to apply for the UK Global Talent Visa, both thought the process would be like all other visa applications\u2014grueling and 3 months long, filled with insurmountable documentation, and lingering interviews.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. In 2020, the UK instituted the Global Talent Visa which allows leaders or potential leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology, to work in the UK for up to 5 years, without a sponsor or a job offer.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Adedeji to TechCabal in an interview. \u201cFrom start to finish, the whole process probably took about 2 months. And from an application perspective, I was most surprised about how effective it was.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 surprise was that a 5-year residence visa existed for writers. \u201cVisas like these are usually reserved for STEM careers or even tech professionals. Writers and poets like me usually focus on fellowships or masters\u2019 degrees,\u201d he commented in a Twitter Space he and Adedeji held earlier this year.\n\nJones\u2019 own application process, from submission to approval, took a total of 2 weeks, but he\u2019d taken 5 months to plan, and the only major delays he experienced were with his medical tests.\n\nOpe Adedeji, managing editor at Paystack\n\nAdedeji and Jones are just 2 out of many Nigerians who have taken advantage of the Global Talent Visa to leave their home countries to work abroad. In fact, Nigeria ranked third for the total number of applications processed for the visa in 2021 while South Africa ranked 10th.\n\nMany more are looking to take advantage of this opportunity, and if you\u2019re one of them, here\u2019s how 2 exceptionally talented individuals japa-ed with the UK Global Talent Visa.\n\nExceptional Talent v Exceptional Promise\n\nThe first stage of applying for the UK Global Talent Visa is getting endorsed by any of 6 relevant endorsing bodies.\n\nUnlike other visa applications where you have to book interviews at consulates, the Global Talent Visa has 6 governing bodies that review applications from applicants who can bid for the visa under 2 circumstances: Exceptional Talent or Exceptional Promise.\n\nPeople who apply under Exceptional Talent are established leaders in the fields of academia and research, arts and culture, and digital technology. They have won prestigious awards, appeared in notable publications, and have many years of experience under their belt.\n\nApplicants under Exceptional Promise have a record of outstanding work in their field over a 5-year period. They are intentional about developing outstanding international track records.\n\nEach of the 6 endorsing bodies has its own requirements for the Exceptional Talent and Exceptional Promise, and you can check them out here.\n\nAdedeji and Jones, both of whom have glowing track records of excellence in writing, applied for the visa under Exceptional Promise for arts and culture, which is open to creatives with careers in literature, dance, architecture, fashion design, film, and animation. The documents they needed were basic: passports, tuberculosis test results, and more importantly, 3 recommendation letters from organisations and people established in their fields.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been published in quite a number of notable magazines and publications over the years, and I also had a few literary awards to my name. I\u2019d also been a speaker at some literary festivals, so all I had to do was gather these in a document and submit it to the Arts Council,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nChika Jones, poet and digital marketing manager\n\nWhen she first heard of the visa, Adedeji, who is also managing editor at Paystack, had thought endorsement would be the most difficult part of the application process. \u201cI was sceptical at first because I thought I probably didn\u2019t qualify. After reading a bit more and speaking to people who\u2019d already gotten the visa, I realised I had a chance, and I took it.\u201d\n\nAdedeji mentioned that she collated links to her appearances and awards, her published stories, and news mentions in a Google Doc. \u201cThat\u2019s all it took,\u201d she said.\n\nJones concurred, adding that the process is less stressful than people think it is. \u201cVisas are notoriously difficult to get, and so people don\u2019t even try. But with this, it wasn\u2019t as mind-numbing as I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe UK Global Talent Visa website states that endorsement takes about 4 weeks, but both writers got their arts and culture endorsements within 2 weeks.\n\nFunfere Koroye, a design engineer whom TechCabal interviewed for an earlier episode of Digital Nomads, applied under Exceptional Talent. His route was a bit different from Adedeji\u2019s and Jones\u2019. While the creators had to apply to the Arts Council England, the endorsing body for arts and culture, Koroye had to apply to Tech Nation, the endorsing body for digital technology.\n\nUnder the digital technology option, people with technical and business skills can apply for endorsement.\n\nThe careers eligible for the digital technology Talent Visa\n\nKoroye already had over 8 years of experience building and designing products, and even building a startup, NuPay Technologies. All he had to do was dust up his resume, gather the links to sites like Figma and GitHub which highlighted his projects, and submit them to Tech Nation. Koroye\u2019s application was so successful he was also invited to become an ambassador for Tech Nation. \u201cMy job as an ambassador is to create more awareness about the visa,\u201d Koroye said. \u201cAcross Africa, not a lot of people know about the visa, so I\u2019m here to spread awareness and give people information about their applications.\u201d\n\nAfter getting endorsed, all the professionals had to do was get their tuberculosis test results, schedule a date for biometric capturing, and submit their applications. Adedeji, who had already been living in the UK for her masters\u2019 at the time, did not have to get a tuberculosis test or buy a ticket.\n\n\u201cMy process took 5 months because it was difficult to get my tuberculosis test, but that was the only stressful part. Everything else was pretty smooth,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAnd the best part\u2026\n\nThe whole process costs about \u00a32,000, said Jones who applied with and moved with his wife.\n\nTotal amount Chika Jones spent applying for the UK Global Talent Visa\n\n\u201cBut it can be more expensive, depending on how many years you apply for, and how you\u2019re moving.\u201d The visa itself costs \u00a3623\u2014\u00a3456 for endorsement and \u00a3167 for the visa application itself. You\u2019ll also have to pay \u00a3624 per year for every year you plan to spend in the UK for up to 5 years.\n\n\u201cFor me, the costs for endorsement, health insurance and biometrics all added up to about \u00a33,500,\u201d said Adedeji.\n\nThe best part about the Global Talent Visa, according to Koroye, is that awardees don\u2019t have to be in the UK all year round. The visa only requires awardees to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every year they have applied for; the rest of the time can be spent in any country of their choosing. \u201cIt just opens you up to a more expansive world,\u201d Koroye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re open to applications from Digital Nomads.

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How to navigate delivery apps and traditional logistics companies in Lagos and Kaduna",
          "text": "This week\u2019s Everyday People comes with a little twist. In the last two months, we\u2019ve talked to a DJ who teaches kids coding, a lawyer who\u2019s also a content creator, a gadget seller at Computer Village, Ikeja, an Uber driver, a dentist turned YouTuber, and Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer.\n\nThis time, we\u2019ll be talking to three business owners about their experiences with delivery and logistics in the bustling city of Lagos and the ancient Kaduna town.\n\nFirst up, Egemba Michael Kachi, chef, photographer, and perfume merchant.\n\nKachi, Perfume Merchant\n\nDo you use delivery apps?\n\nI don\u2019t really use delivery apps. Someone introduced me to one, but I can\u2019t remember the platform. I booked the ride and was asked to pay, which I did. I was told the delivery person would be with me in about two hours. Throughout the day, I did not see anybody, didn\u2019t do the delivery, and had already paid.\n\nSo, I spoke to them, and they said, \u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen next time,\u201d and I believed them. The next day, the same thing happened.\n\nKachi\n\nThey eventually did the delivery, but that was it for me; I just went back to my individual rider companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with traditional delivery companies?\n\nWith delivery companies, just mentally prepare yourself because you can\u2019t control anything. They could pick up from you and tell you they are going there immediately, and only for you to realise five or six hours later, late in the evening, that they\u2019ve still not delivered.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you, \u201cOh, the bike spoilt.\u201d\n\nOr, they were held up by local government boys, or they had an accident, blah blah blah. So whenever I\u2019m doing deliveries, I basically tell my customers, \u201cYou could get it today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m giving an excuse, but just in case something happens. And the annoying thing is when they know they\u2019re running late, they won\u2019t call. If you call, they might not pick up or be very rude when they do.\n\nOne time I gave a package to the wrong rider; I was so confused that day, like, \u201cWho did I give my perfume to?\u201d It didn\u2019t end there, though. The rider dropped it off at their office, and my perfume went missing. The manager had to threaten not to pay his people their salaries before it was found.\n\nAnother time, the rider delivered the perfume at 11 p.m. At night! To give him credit, the manager had told me it would be same-day delivery; I just didn\u2019t know his today meant from the start of the day to the end of the day.\n\nSo how do you handle customers then?\n\nI steadily update them. So that gives them a bit of confidence. It would be very odd if I told them a rider had picked up and they didn\u2019t hear anything from the rider or me all day, and they didn\u2019t see their deliveries all; it\u2019d look like I\u2019m a fraud. So I\u2019m constantly communicating with the riders and giving the customers feedback.\n\nNext, we have Feranmi Ajetomobi, a growth marketer at Flutterwave and the Co-founder of Nigerian food startup, NiFries.\n\nFeranmi, Co-founder of NiFries\n\nFeranmi\n\nHow do you run your deliveries?\n\nWe do a mix, actually. So we have apps, and our delivery guys, like people we built relationships with to help handle the deliveries. That is very important because when you start running a delivery service for food in Lagos if you depend solely on apps, you\u2019d most likely be disappointed unless the orders come from the apps.\n\nMost times, you have to actually get traditional riders who are available at any time. It\u2019s a supply-demand issue because, say, I finished cooking by 11:00 a.m. and somebody orders at that point, I would have to go into the app, order for a rider, and then wait for the rider to come.\n\nSometimes some riders don\u2019t come early, and at other times, you wouldn\u2019t even get the rider. So there\u2019s a big supply issue when it comes to the delivery apps.\n\nFor areas around us, we\u2019ve actually resorted to bicycles that handle deliveries on our behalf.\n\nThere\u2019s also pricing. If somebody orders food by 11:00 a.m. and you tell them they\u2019ll get it in 45 minutes, but another order comes before you finish packaging it by 11:45 a.m., one rider can take everything.\n\nBut when it comes to the apps, I need to wait for orders to compile before I can make a request.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI think logistics companies that focus on other forms of logistics have no business with the food business because, first off, the margins are very low. Nobody wants to pay \u20a61,000 ($2) for food that costs \u20a6800 ($1.8). But say I\u2019m buying shoes, I will pay \u20a61,500 ($3) because the shoes probably cost \u20a610,000 ($23) or even \u20a630,000 ($70).\n\nBecause of that margin cost, you either give that delivery company a bulk of those orders, or they charge you high because you\u2019ve made just one order.\n\nThe alternative I\u2019ve seen work is with companies like Chowdeck, a logistics company for food businesses. And their approach is to run a marketplace where food operators like me can list our business and get orders through them. It is the same thing with Bolt Food.\n\nThat way, I don\u2019t bother with logistics; I don\u2019t bother about the price. The good thing is that aside from running that marketplace, you can have an agreement with Chowdeck that allows you to have some bikes and bicycles at your store.\n\nIt is possible to get orders or process orders outside their marketplace. The hybrid structure is the best, honestly, because it allows you to mix the marketplace structure with your bike.\n\nYou have more professionalism, and you can easily track your goods. There\u2019s accountability and protection for your product. And some of them even insure your products, so if they get damaged, you are covered to an extent.\n\nWould you ever enter the logistics part of the business?\n\nThere\u2019s no economic sense in owning a bike. In the future, I can come together with other food business owners and build a consortium of bikes; we\u2019d put money together and own our delivery network.\n\nThen I can be confident to own bikes. But for me, to own banks on my own, it\u2019s not a wise business decision at all. It\u2019s too expensive. Maintainance capital costs and even operational costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you wish delivery apps could do better?\n\nTracking. Most of them are bad at it so you can\u2019t accurately track where the rider is with your food.\n\nLast but not least is Yetunde Aisha, the Founder of Shop Yetu, who sells thrift items and essential oils.\n\nYetunde, Entrepreneur\n\nYetunde\n\nSo how do you do your deliveries?\n\nI deliver within and outside Kaduna. At first, I was using all these normal bike logistics companies for deliveries within Kaduna.\n\nBut late last year, there was a ban on all motorcycles, so those logistics companies couldn\u2019t operate. You had to have a car or Keke [tricycle] to do what the bikes were doing. So deliveries within Kaduna were halted for some time because I had to look for another means of delivering my items.\n\nAnd the thing with having a business online is that apart from the price of the item, some people get discouraged when they hear the cost of delivery. Delivery within Kaduna used to cost \u20a6500 ($1), but the people using cars were charging \u20a61,000 ($2) or \u20a61,500 ($3). So it\u2019s either you increase the delivery fee, or you take out of the profit you\u2019re making from your business. Then I got a Keke guy.\n\nFor deliveries outside Kaduna to certain places like Abuja, I like using public transport and a car costs \u20a61,500. But those ones are a bit tricky because you can\u2019t track them. You have to keep calling the driver, and sometimes they switch off their phones. Or you take it to the motor park, and they put it in another car.\n\nThere was an item I sent to Jos last year, but it ended up in Sokoto; I still don\u2019t understand it. And then, because of kidnapping issues, some of the cars don\u2019t arrive until late at night. So I had to get someone at the holding park in Mabushi [Abuja].\n\nFor any place outside Abuja, I strictly use GIG Logistics because you can track the packages, and so far, I am satisfied. I\u2019ve been using GIG since last year, and I\u2019ve had only one issue when they mixed up my packages.\n\nHave you tried other companies?\n\nI tried DHL, but it wasn\u2019t working out because they\u2019re very expensive. A good example is Maiduguri, where I send items using regular public transport. I used DHL three times when their rates were still reasonable, but with the fuel scarcity and increase in fuel price, their rates have gone up. I think one month, when I wanted to send a package, they told me it would cost \u20a68,000 ($18).\n\nHow much is the cloth the person bought? With public transport, you pay like \u20a62,000 ($4), and it gets there.",

          "title": "Nigeria tilts towards fresh N7trn loan as Q1\u2019 22 revenue disappoints",
          "text": "Nigeria will require about N7.38 trillion in new loans from May to December 2022 due to its inability to generate adequate revenue in the first four months of 2022, BusinessDay analysis has revealed. And with the factors responsible for the poor revenue generation still ravaging, the federal government is left with no options but new loans to augment its revenues in order to remain solvent in 2022 and beyond.\n\nAt the presentation of the budget performance last Thursday in Abuja, the minister of finance, budget, and national planning, Zainab Ahmed, said that Nigeria realized N1.23 trillion revenue between January and April 2022, which amounted to 39.4 percent of the pro-rata target of N3.12 trillion for the same period. Full-year 2022 revenue target is N9.36 trillion.\n\nAccording to the minister, the government spent N4.72 trillion as an expenditure against the pro rata target of N5.77 trillion for the same period. She stated that the components of expenditure included debt servicing which gulped N1.94 trillion; expended N1.26 trillion as personnel costs including pensions, while N773.63 billion was spent as capital expenditure.\n\nThe synthesis of the fiscal data presented by the finance minister shows that Nigeria\u2019s actual expenditure for 2022 will be in the region of N14.16 trillion in contrast to the projected expenditure of 17.32 trillion in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nRead also:Petrol subsidy nears N6.7trn as debt service exceeds revenue\n\nOn the whole, the difference between the full year\u2019s possible revenue of N3.69 trillion and expenditure of N14.16 trillion will be N10.47 trillion, and having incurred N3.09 trillion in the first four months of the year, the balance of N7.38 trillion will constitute Nigeria\u2019s new loans from May to December 2022.\n\nData sourced from the Debt Management Office confirm Nigeria has started amassing debts as the reality of poor revenue generation dawned on the government. The federal government sourced an additional $1.58 billion in external loans in Q1 2022. This is because foreign debts rose from $38.39 billion in December 2021 to $39.97 billion in March 2022.\n\nAlso, the government equally sourced new N901.47 billion in domestic loans during the first quarter of 2022, because the domestic debt increased from N19.24 trillion in December 2021 to N20.14 trillion as of March 2022. The rising debt obligations explain why from January to April 2022, debt servicing gulped N1.94 trillion, which surpassed the actual revenue of N1.23 trillion made during the period.\n\nRead also: How FBN Holdings\u2019 profit rose by 99% on bad loan recoveries\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government is losing revenue from stolen oil, which was heavily subsidised in every aspect of our national life will continue to impact the deficit gap. From FX subsidy to fuel subsidy and power subsidy means the government is losing revenue to fund intangible development\u201d, Fatai Asimi, a Lagos-based market intelligence analyst, said.\n\n\u201cWe are likely to see sustained local borrowing and thus crowding out the private sector in the credit market. The banks\u2019 lending to the private sector is dwindling and not likely to change in the near term. The chances of government borrowing from the international market may be slim due to the general hike in interest rates across the various economies\u201d, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the loan option comes at a higher cost in view of the hawkish stance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Between April and July, the CBN raised the Monetary Policy Rate (MPC) twice, cumulatively by 250 basis points from 11.5 percent to 14 percent in response to external factors, directly increasing the cost of borrowing for governments, businesses, and households.\n\nDespite the hike, investors\u2019 interest in Nigeria\u2019s fixed income instruments waned in July as the DMO was unable to raise all the amounts offered at the July auction.\n\nThe bond auction was oversubscribed in June 2022 following the allotment of N226.15 billion to investors against N225 billion on offer. However, the Nigerian government raised just N123.84 billion out of N225 billion on offer at the July 2022 auction.\n\n\u201cHigher cost of borrowing means that consumers are more likely to default now on their borrowings from banks. Higher interest payments by the government on new bonds and treasury bills are not good for the authorities\u201d, Tajudeen Ibrahim, senior analyst with ChapelHill Denham, said.\n\nYields on Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds have risen just as their prices are heading southwards, increasing the cost of borrowing for the government from overseas, thus foreclosing Eurobond as an alternative financing option for the remaining part of the year.\n\nAnalysts also believe that it will take a while before the federal government will increase revenue generation through higher crude oil production due to crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported that Nigeria produced 1.299 million barrels of crude oil per day in the first quarter of 2022. The country produced 1.219 barrels per day in April, 1.024 million barrels per day in May, and 1.158 million barrels per day in June as against 1.8 million barrels per day allocated to it by OPEC.",

          "text": "Adoption of technology, religious sentiments, the rise of third forces, increased polictical awarenes and participation among Nigerian youths drive other factors that tense up the political space ahead of general elections in 2023.\n\nAs the race to elect new Nigerian leaders \u2014 president, governors and lawmakers \u2014 in 2023 approaches, a delegation of international election observers from the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI), were in Nigeria from July 13 to 22, 2022.\n\nThe delegation met with representatives from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the National Assembly, political parties, civil society, the media, security forces, academia, and diplomatic missions to assess the current political and electoral environment in the run-up to the general elections in 2023, preparations for the general elections and offer recommendations to boost citizen confidence in the process and mitigate the risk of electoral violence; and demonstrate inter-party cooperation.\n\nFollowing that, the delegates issued a statement outlining their observations.\n\nThe governorship elections in Osun and Ekiti states, according to the statement, demonstrated the positive impact of INEC initiatives implemented since 2019 to improve results transparency, such as the introduction of the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV) and the elimination of voting points.\n\nThe election observers held that the 2023 elections will depart from some of the political dynamics that defined previous elections in the country. For the first time since 2007, there will be no incumbent in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of Peter Obi \u2013 former Anambra state governor and presidential candidate for the Labour Party (LP) \u2013 and Rabiu Kwankwaso \u2013 former Kano governor and presidential candidate for the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) \u2013 as viable \u201cThird Forces\u201d has excited many young Nigerians. If a third party draws sufficient support, a runoff presidential election could be a real possibility for the first time since the transition to democracy, adding complexity to the 2023 elections,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nFurthermore, improvements in Electoral Reform, Transparency of Election Results, Electoral Disputes, Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), Promoting Peaceful Elections, and party Primaries are notable among the summation of international election observers\u2019 observations with Nigeria\u2019s political structure, particularly on the part of INEC.\n\n\u201cStakeholders noted to the delegation that the 2022 primaries were more transparent, inclusive, and peaceful than in the past. Despite persistent incidents of vote buying and interference by some governors, the use of ad hoc, as opposed to statutory delegates, reduced the influence of party leadership members on the selection of candidates, leading to more transparency in voting and less violence than in 2018,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn the other hand, the delegates surmised intra-party disputes, monetization of politics, insecurity, election violence, electoral offenses,\n\nmisinformation, disinformation, and hate speech, as some of the prevalent shortcomings that must be addressed ahead of the elections.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has deepened, spreading to many parts of the country. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project, Nigeria experienced more incidents of political violence, conflict, and protest in 2021 than in any other year since data collection began in 1997,\u201d the observers said.\n\n\u201cWith a dramatic increase in banditry, kidnapping, and criminality across the country, it is therefore likely that the 2023 elections will take place in an environment that is more insecure than in previous polls.\u201d\n\nHowever, the delegation\u2019s work, which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), produced 24 recommendations for a successful election in 2023.\n\nRead also: Osun, Ekiti elections boost public confidence in INEC \u2013 Report\n\nOn election administration\n\nThe group urged the electoral umpire, INEC to allocate its remaining funds to ensure that it can complete procurement processes, training, and the deployment of necessary personnel and materials.\n\nThe observers implored INEC to implement assistive voting cubicles for people living with disabilities, women, youth and Internally Displaced Persons.\n\n\u201cWith this change, INEC should consider voting cubicle modifications that protect ballot secrecy,\u201d the group said in it\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThe government should end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. This is critical for security because young people who are unable to study are more likely to be recruited into cults, gangs, or other groups that contribute to electoral violence.\u201d\n\nConcerning security, the delegates urged INEC and security forces to anticipate and plan for situations in which violence may be used to suppress votes or change outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe government should address formally the role that informal security outfits (such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu) may play in the run-up to and during elections,\u201d the group said.\n\nAccording to the results of the assessment of Nigeria\u2019s electoral environment, if the 2023 elections failed to improve on previous elections, Nigerians may lose faith in the potential and dividends of democracy.\n\nSince the transition from military to civilian democratic rule in 1999, both the NDI and the IRI have sent international election observers to all general elections in Nigeria.\n\nLater this year, NDI and IRI will send a second pre-election assessment delegation, as well as a joint international delegation, to observe the presidential and National Assembly elections in 2023.",

The cost of rod has also gone up and it\u2019s going up by the day.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, beyond the global tendencies of Russia-Ukraine war which has also devalued our naira and making it to depreciate on daily basis and this goes a long way to affect the original cost of contracts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, who was conducted round the project by the Commissioner for Works (Highways and Urban Roads) Mr Noel Omodon, explained that government was left with no option than to review the cost of the projects to ensure their timely completion amid biting inflation.\n\n\u201cHaving looked at everything, we needed to save the budget and the earlier we find a pathway to completing the projects the better, otherwise the escalation continues even more on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s quite difficult and we wished we didn\u2019t get into the kind of difficulties we are in to, but we have no choice.\n\n\u201cWe have started the projects and we have to complete them otherwise the contractors will move out of site and when they move out, to remobilise is at a higher cost and we don\u2019t want to go through that route at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unfortunate situation we find ourselves; it distorts our budgeting and we just hope that we are able to continue realigning our budget to keep pace with the construction that we are undergoing.\n\n\u201cBeyond having the infrastructure in place, it also creates jobs for our young ones and we cannot afford to have the contractors move out of site because it will mean that you are going to take food off the table of families which is also not good for us.\n\n\u201cI have been informed that the project would be completed by the end of December, 2022.\n\n\u201cFrom what we are seeing, life is coming back to Isheagu from the excitement on the faces of the people because the road would help them to evacuate their farm produce,\u201d he stated.\u200b\n\nOkowa also inspected ongoing works at the Sector C1 of the Ughelli-Asaba road by Obo River where the contractor said the bridge construction would be completed in October while the road would be ready in December, 2022.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has said that Bola Tinubu, his All Progressives Congress (APC), is mentally unstable and cannot sit for a one hour interview.\n\nThe former vice president who tackled Tinubu over his earlier attack on him via a statement issued by media aide, Mr. Paul Ibe, said the ex governor of Lagos has not sat down to do any prolonged interview for obvious reasons.\n\nThe Tinubu Campaign Organisation had stated that it was extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the PDP\u2019s presidential candidate during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nThe organisation accused the former vice president of violating provisions of the 1999 constitution when he decided to have other business interest as a young Custom Officer.\n\nBut reacting in a statement on Saturday, Atiku\u2019s aide expressed amusement in what he described as a knee jerk response from the Tinubu Campaign Organisation to the \u201cwave making interview granted by Waziri Atiku Abubakar to Arise TV.\u201d\n\nIbe mocked Tinubu, saying the former governor has not sat down to do any prolonged interview for obvious reasons.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians have seen him talk in public and can themselves gauge the reason why he is mortified to grant any prolong interview.\n\nAtiku\u2019s aide said: \u201cThe Tinubu campaign exposed its gross desperation and vacuousness by citing the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) 1999, to declare Waziri Atiku Abubakar\u2019s stance on engaging in a side business while he was a young custom officer as a breach of the law. It is pertinent to educate the Tinubu campaign organisation that Nigeria is not under a military regime and our Constitutions are not retroactive in nature.\n\n\u201cAgain, the Tinubu campaign betrayed either dishonesty or lack of attention to detail by claiming that Atiku Abubakar said oil contributed 20% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. That is a lie. What the Waziri said is as follows: \u201cOil only maybe accounts for about 20% of our GDP\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe use of the word maybe by the Waziri was in reflection to the different figures given. While the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics states a figure close to 10%, other multilateral organisations have given a much higher figure of between 15-20%. So, while the jury is still out, it is right to qualify the contribution of oil and gas as a maybe. However, we do like to point out that Waziri Atiku Abubakar mentioned both the PDP and the APC during the interview and did not forget the name of his own party.\n\n\u201cIt seems the Tinubu campaign organisation (can a disorganised body be called an organisation?) does not know the meaning of rotation of power and micro zoning. So, we will gladly educate them. Rotation of power refers to a constitutional provision where power is zoned between North and South. Micro-zoning refers to a non constitutional idea, where power is zoned not between North and South, but amongst geo-political zones. We hope this cures the political illiteracy of the authors of that document.\n\n\u201cThe rude response also accuses Waziri Atiku Abubakar of having \u201climited education\u201d. Atiku Abubakar has an earned Masters degree from Anglia Ruskin University. We challenge any of the present Presidential candidates to present an equal or higher degree. Moreover, his university attendance is a matter of verified record. Can we say the same about some other persons?\n\n\u201cOn President Lincoln, we are afraid the poor student of history is the Tinubu campaign disorganisation. Yes, it is true that Lincoln ran for President with his name on the ballot twice. But he ran at other times, and failed to get his name on the ballot.\u201d\n\nAtiku challenge Bola Tinubu to subject himself to an hour long interview, like the Atiku did, promising to engage with the former Lagos State Governor if he is able to be as articulate and mentally present as the PDP candidate.\n\n\u201cUntil then, we will only want to remind him and his yes men that they are not in a position to point fingers when they have not sat on the hot seat,\u201d Atiku\u2019s aide stated.",

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has berated Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party Party (PDP), describing him a desperate who should never be president of Nigeria.\n\nTinubu\u2019s attack on the former vice president is in reaction to an Arise Television interview aired on Friday in which he addressed a lot of issues including a claim that he fell out with Tinubu in 2007 because he (Atiku) was opposed to a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.\n\nIn response to a question on his thoughts on the Muslim-Muslim Presidential ticket of the APC, Atiku said: \u201cMy fundamental disagreement with Asiwaju since 2007 was on the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket. That was my fundamental disagreement and departure from Asiwaju.\n\n\u201cTogether with Asiwaju, we formed ACN and I was given a ticket in Lagos and he insisted to be my running mate and I said no, I am not going to have a Muslim-Muslim ticket and because of that he switched his support to the late Umaru Yar`Adua and that was the departing point and of course, it is also a fact that when Buhari emerged in Lagos in 2015 that I also opposed a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cI opposed it and my opposition actually reinforced the decision of President Buhari to pick a Christian running mate. So, I have all along opposed that. I don\u2019t believe in that. I don\u2019t believe it is right for a country like Nigeria that is multi-ethnic, multi religious that there should be balancing of interests, whether religious or otherwise.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as Tinubu\u2019s running mate would not damage his (Atiku\u2019s) chances in the Northeast, the PDP candidate said, \u201cCertainly, prospects are much higher. If you know the composition of the Northeast, you have Borno and Yobe; these are essentially two Kanuri states, then you have the other states which are essentially Hausa-Fulani. So, even if people are going to vote on that basis, I think I have a more favourable (support) from the Northeast.\u201d\n\nHowever, speaking through his campaign organization on Saturday in a statement, Tinubu faulted most of the claims made by the former vice president, noting that the APC was extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the PDP presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cIn the interview, Alhaji Atiku exposed himself as a man who is not prepared for the job he is applying for and a man who can not be entrusted with our commonwealth. He was flippant in his response to important questions about his record of service and how he made money while serving in Customs. He muddled up facts and exhibited befudling absence of mind\u201d, Tinubu said through the Director, Media and Communication of his campaign organization, Mr Bayo Onanuga.\n\nStating that the PDP candidate bungled the interview, Tinubu also described him as a lawbreaker.\n\nHe said; \u201cPDP candidate is a law breaker: It was most shocking Atiku admitted that he cheated the system for decades and engaged in gross misconduct as a government worker. As a customs officer at the Idi-Iroko border, Atiku revealed that he ran a commercial taxi service, claiming \u2018there is no law stopping public officers from doing business in Nigeria\u201d. He punched harder, claiming there is no conflict of interest in doing so.\n\n\u201cWe found this to be untrue. Every officer in the civil service is expected to comply with a code of conduct and service rules which bar civil and public servants from engaging in private business while in government employment to the detriment of the service he/she is employed to render to the public. The 1999 constitution further codifies this in Part I, Fifth Schedule, Section of 2 (b).\n\n\u201cIt says a public officer shall not, except where he is not employed on full-time basis engage or participate in the management or running of any private business, profession or trade. The rules however allow a public officer to engage in farming.\n\n\u201cWe wonder which rule or which law Atiku was relying upon for his gross misconduct as a public officer. It is our considered view that Atiku gamed the system all through his career in public service, culminating in his founding of the Intel Logistics along with Late Shehu Yar\u2019Adua and some Italians, even while he was still in the employment of the Nigeria Customs Service\u201d.\n\nHe said Atiku also has a poor knowledge of key sectors of the economy, adding; \u201cWe also found it surprising that the PDP presidential candidate does not know the contribution of oil and gas industry to Nigeria\u2019s GDP. He claimed the sector represents 20% of our national GDP whereas it is below 10 percent and it is still falling owing to the growth of non-oil sector under the current All Progressives Congress led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cFalse Data from Egypt: Atiku Abubakar wanted to impress his audience with his supposed knowledge of international affairs. He ended up embarrassing himself with false data he cited from Egypt. We found his claim that Egypt has 2 million police officers on the streets to be untrue. Various sources put the number at about 500,000 for a population of 104 million and not 80 million as falsely claimed by Atiku\u201d.\n\nOn the issue of Rotational Presidency, Tinubu said Atiku should be more focused on the issue and not a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cAsked to justify why the PDP jettisoned Section 3c of its own constitution which enshrines power rotation between the North and South, Atiku tried to fudge his answer by focusing on Governor Nyesom Wike and his effort to reconcile with him after he, a northerner snatched the presidential ticket that ought to have been taken by a southerner. While Atiku was playing to the gallery on APC\u2019s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, he didn\u2019t see seeking to be President after 8years of a President from his part of Nigeria as politics of exclusion.\n\n\u201cProbed further, Atiku provided several contradictory answers. In one breath, he said power rotation is not in the constitution. In another breath, he said the PDP has never \u2018micro zoned any position\u2019. Then he admitted that the party has always rotated power between the North and the South. Atiku\u2019s justification as to why he became PDP\u2019s presidential candidate, instead of a southerner is a perfect example in ellipsis: \u2018In politics\u2019, he said, \u2018we negotiate power through negotiations(sic)\u2019. Whatever that means.\n\n\u201cAtiku ever an expert in not telling the truth also did not come clean over his once-upon a time preference for same-faith ticket. In 1993, after Atiku and Kingibe lost to MKO Abiola in the SDP presidential primary in Jos, Atiku was the choice of the Yar\u2019Adua camp to become Abiola\u2019s running mate. Abiola overlooked him and picked the more cerebral diplomat and bureaucrat, Babagana Kingibe. In all the tonnes of biographies written about him, there was no where he said he opposed Shehu Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s support for his candidacy as Abiola\u2019s VP. He was not against it, since it favoured him. Now, it is politically convenient and opportunistic for him to oppose Tinubu-Shettima ticket.\n\n\u201cPolitical Credentials: Most reprehensible was Atiku\u2019s lies about how many times he ran to become the governor of Adamawa or old Gongola state.\n\n\u201cMr. Presidential candidate, in case you don\u2019t know due to your limited education, you run for an office, only, when you are on the ballot in an election. Your signifying interest in an office does not mean the same as running for the office. From available records, the first time you contested the governorship election in your state was in 1999. Your name entered the ballot for the first time and you won.\n\n\u201cPoor grasp of history: Atiku Abubakar also exhibited poor Knowledge of history when he claimed that Abraham Lincoln, one of America\u2019s famous leaders contested the presidency five to six times before he eventually won.\n\n\u201cThis is a beer parlour tale that has been recycled over time. Lincoln contested U.S. presidency twice. He ran in 1860 and 1864 and won both, before he was assassinated on 15 April, 1865.\n\n\u201cThe false story about Lincoln\u2019s failed presidential bids sprang from his previous failed state and national elections, from his state of Illinois. They were not the same as America\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cAccording to historians, Lincoln lost his first election in 1832 for Illinois state legislature. In 1834, he ran again and won.\n\n\u201cIn 1843 he ran for Congress. He lost. Three years after in 1846, Lincoln ran for Congress again \u2013 this time he won and went to Washington. From established history, in 1848, Lincoln ran for re-election to Congress and lost. In 1854, he ran for Senate of the United States. He lost. Lincoln also made another failed bid for U.S. Senate from Illinois in 1858. He lost to Democrat Steven Douglas.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is ill-prepared to be President of Nigeria if he could bungle a Television interview that was planned well ahead of the day and time the duo of Dr. Reuben Abati and Ms.Tundun Abiola conducted it.\n\n\u201cWe expected the PDP presidential candidate to be well informed on any issue before coming on national television to expose himself to avoidable ridicule\u201d, he stated.",

          "title": "Running Mate Offer: I\u2019ll Name Witnesses, Tinubu Dares Atiku",
          "text": "Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Saturday has challenged claims by Atiku Abubakar, the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), that he rejected the former Lagos governor as his running mate ahead of the 2007 presidential election.\n\nChallenging claims made by Abubakar, a former Vice President, in a recent interview, Tinubu instead made counterclaim that Atiku actually offered him the opportunity to the vice presidential running mate on the platform of the Congress in 2007.\n\nTo this, Tunde Rahman, spokesman to the APC presidential candidate said there are witnesses who can come forward should Atiku insist on misleading Nigerians that he has had misgivings about a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.\n\nThe former Lagos State Governor, in a statement issued Saturday evening by his Media Office and signed by Tunde Rahman said Atiku had in 2007 promised him the vice presidential ticket and later reneged on the promise, just as he did recently with Nyesom Wike, the Rivers State governor.\n\nAccording to him, the former vice president also used the same deception on Wike whom he promised the vice presidential ticket after the PDP primary election but reneged.\n\nTackling the former vice president for criticizing his Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, Tinubu recalled how Atiku had fought vigorously in 1993 to become the running mate to the late Chief MKO Abiola after losing the presidential ticket to the deceased.\n\nReacting however, Atiku Abubakar described Tinubu\u2019s comments on the interview as a knee jerk response to a wave making interview. The PDP presidential candidate has however not provided more details about what transpired between him and Tinubu back in 2007.\n\nThe APC candidate said \u201call Nigerians should feel great pity and sadness for the candidate of Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar\u201d noting that Atiku in a desperate attempt to win the election by stoking religious bias, has reduced himself to uttering baseless lies on national television.\n\nIt would be recalled that Atiku had on Friday featured on Arise Television where he said Tinubu ditched him in 2007 because he (Atiku) was opposed to having a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nTinubu said, \u201cWe are saddened to see such a man become unhinged from the truth. So obsessed is he with his quest for office, Atiku is willing to render any form of untruth if he thinks it might gain him a single vote. Atiku may want to be president. However, all he has shown is that he is a pathological liar.\n\n\u201cWhatever moral compass he (Atiku) had has been lost. During a 22nd July television interview, Atiku assaulted historic truth by lying that he did not name Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the Action Congress ticket because Atiku did not want a Muslim as his running mate.\u201d\n\nSetting the records straight Tinubu explained that Atiku was not among those who founded the defunct Action Congress, saying \u201cIt was the actual founders of the AC who offered the party\u2019s flag to Atiku because of the need to fight the authoritarian designs then President Obasanjo and the PDP had on Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, Atiku had been unceremoniously pushed aside if not out of the PDP by Obasanjo. We needed to rally all forces to confront the one-party state Obasanjo had in mind. Atiku was simply a beneficiary of this collective duty to fight the attack on multi-party democracy the PDP had launched.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for dear old Atiku. Love of his own ambition has eclipsed his relationship with the truth and an honest account of the past. We formed the AC without his knowledge. When President Obasanjo virtually exiled him from the PDP, we lent him our support by giving him the AC platform for the 2007 election.\n\n\u201cLet me say openly that Atiku offered me the vice presidential ticket in 2007. Let me also say that my religion has not changed. When he offered the position to me, I was a Muslim and I believe he was aware of my religious faith at the time.\n\n\u201cAtiku\u2019s calculations and deceit had nothing to do with religion or his sensitivity to it. His conduct has everything to do with what we discovered about his paucity of character and love of intrigues.\n\n\u201cTrue to form, Atiku, fifteen years later, promised HE Governor Nyesom Wike the same thing this electoral season and similarly reneged. Governor Wike is a Christian.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to intrigues, we can say that Atiku is without bias. He will attempt to lie and deceive both Christians and Muslims with equal vigour.\n\n\u201cAtiku has no business raising the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket except as a hypocrite. Perhaps he believes people have forgotten his antics during the 1993 election. After he woefully lost his bid to be the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, what did he do? He canvassed and lobbied harder than anyone to become the running mate to late Chief MKO Abiola. When it benefitted him personally, Atiku did not see anything wrong with Muslim-Muslim ticket. He saw everything right in such a ticket as long as he was on it.\n\n\u201cNow, Atiku criticizes my selection as running mate based on religion. He does so because he cannot criticize it on other grounds. If Atiku were to have one of his rare moments of honesty, he would admit that the person I selected as my running mate is more qualified for the position than the man who joined him. And this conclusion has nothing to do with religious faith. It has everything to do with competence, experience, ability, and vision.\n\n\u201cMy running mate and I are here to build a more just and prosperous society for all Nigerians, be they Christian, Muslim or adherents of other faiths. It seems that Atiku is here trying to build an edifice of lies and call that the house into which Nigerians should walk and reside. He will fail in this sad attempt to trick an entire nation.\n\nThe director, Media & Communication of Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga, also responded to the Atiku interview saying they were shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by Atiku.\n\nOnanuga said Atiku exposed himself as a man who is not prepared for the job he is applying for and a man who can not be entrusted with our commonwealth.\n\n\u201cHe was flippant in his response to important questions about his record of service and how he made money while serving in Customs. He muddled up facts and exhibited befudling absence of mind.\u201d\n\nGiving details Onanuga accused the PDP candidate of being a law breaker, adding that it was most shocking for him to have admitted that he cheated the system for decades and engaged in gross misconduct as a government worker.\n\n\u201cAs a customs officer at the Idi-Iroko border, Atiku revealed that he ran a commercial taxi service, claiming \u2018there is no law stopping public officers from doing business in Nigeria\u201d. He punched harder, claiming there is no conflict of interest in doing so. We found this to be untrue.\n\n\u201cEvery officer in the civil service is expected to comply with a code of conduct and service rules which bar civil and public servants from engaging in private business while in government employment to the detriment of the service he/she is employed to render to the public. The 1999 constitution further codifies this in Part I, Fifth Schedule, Section of 2 (b).\n\n\u201cIt says a public officer shall not, except where he is not employed on full-time basis engage or participate in the management or running of any private business, profession or trade. The rules however allow a public officer to engage in farming.\n\n\u201cWe wonder which rule or which law Atiku was relying upon for his gross misconduct as a public officer. It is our considered view that Atiku gamed the system all through his career in public service, culminating in his founding of the Intel Logistics along with Late Shehu Yar\u2019Adua and some Italians, even while he was still in the employment of the Nigeria Customs Service.\u201d\n\nThe Tinubu team also said Atiku has poor knowledge of key sectors of the economy, noting that it was surprising that he does not know the contribution of oil and gas industry to Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the sector represents 20% of our national GDP whereas it is below 10 percent and it is still falling owing to the growth of non-oil sector under the current All Progressives Congress led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s media adviser, Paul Ibe, in a counter statement, said Tinubu has not sat down to do any prolonged interview for obvious reasons, adding \u201cNigerians have seen him talk in public and can themselves gauge the reason why he is mortified to do so.\u201d\n\nReacting to the issues raised however, Atiku said\n\n\u201cThe Tinubu campaign exposed its gross desperation and vacuousness by citing the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) 1999, to declare Waziri Atiku Abubakar\u2019s stance on engaging in a side business while he was a young custom officer as a breach of the law. It is pertinent to educate the Tinubu campaign organisation that Nigeria is not under a military regime and our Constitutions are not retroactive in nature.\n\n\u201cAgain, the Tinubu campaign betrayed either dishonesty or lack of attention to detail by claiming that Atiku Abubakar said oil contributed 20% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. That is a lie. What the Waziri said is as follows:\n\n\u201cOil only maybe accounts for about 20% of our GDP\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe use of the word maybe by the Waziri was in reflection to the different figures given. While the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics states a figure close to 10%, other multilateral organisations have given a much higher figure of between 15-20%. So, while the jury is still out, it is right to qualify the contribution of oil and gas as a maybe. However, we do like to point out that Waziri Atiku Abubakar mentioned both the PDP and the APC during the interview and did not forget the name of his own party.\n\n\u201cIt seems the Tinubu campaign organisation (can a disorganised body be called an organisation?) does not know the meaning of rotation of power and micro zoning. So, we will gladly educate them. Rotation of power refers to a constitutional provision where power is zoned between North and South. Micro-zoning refers to a non constitutional idea, where power is zoned not between North and South, but amongst geo-political zones. We hope this cures the political illiteracy of the authors of that document.\n\n\u201cThe rude response also accuses Waziri Atiku Abubakar of having \u201climited education\u201d. Atiku Abubakar has an earned Masters degree from Anglia Ruskin University. We challenge any of the present Presidential candidates to present an equal or higher degree. Moreover, his university attendance is a matter of verified record. Can we say the same about some other persons?\n\n\u201cOn President Lincoln, we are afraid the poor student of history is the Tinubu campaign disorganisation. Yes, it is true that Lincoln ran for President with his name on the ballot twice. But he ran at other times, and failed to get his name on the ballot.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we would like to challenge Bola Tinubu to subject himself to an hour long interview, like the Waziri did, and if he is able to be as articulate and mentally present as our candidate, then he can talk. Until then, we will only want to remind him and his yes men that they are not in a position to point fingers when they have not sat on the hot seat,\u201d Atiku\u2019s media aide stated.",
          "summary": "The PDP presidential candidate has however not provided more details about what transpired between him and Tinubu back in 2007.\nAfter he woefully lost his bid to be the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, what did he do?\nHe canvassed and lobbied harder than anyone to become the running mate to late Chief MKO Abiola.\n\u201cNow, Atiku criticizes my selection as running mate based on religion.\n\u201cMy running mate and I are here to build a more just and prosperous society for all Nigerians, be they Christian, Muslim or adherents of other faiths.",

          "text": "The hottest places in Hell are reserved for those who, in a period of moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.\u201d (Dante Aliegri)\n\nThe unfolding certificate forgery scandal hanging around the neck of Pastor Umo Eno, the man whom Deacon Udom Emmanuel and his boys \u2013 Barr. Emmanuel Enoidem , Enobong Uwah and Frank Archibong imposed as the \u2018governorship candidate\u2019 of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) in our dear State is such that men and women of good conscience who mean well for this State can no longer sit back and watch or stand and stare as if it is of no consequence. Yes , the threesome have made their money , extended their empires and are living large , bestriding the state and country as colossuses. The unfortunate and unfolding Ordinary level certificate forgery saga has brought an unmitigated embarrassment and shame on Akwa Ibom people and the whole state with potentials of even wider implications. Akwa Ibom State has a solid standing as a land that has produced well educated men and women who have excelled in academia, businesses and the professions over the years. For crying out loud , this is the home state of revered icons like the late international jurist, Hon.Dr.Egbert Udo Udoma , who distinguished himself as a first class scholar in Dublin in the 1930\u2019s. This state also produced the legendary Barr. O.O.Ita of Oro extraction. This state had the educationist, Professor Eyo Ita , the 7 merchants of light , including Professors Essien Udom, Donald Ekong , Reuben Uko , Sam Akpabot , Etim Essien , Okon Uya , Enyenihi and thousands of others in the state , across Nigeria and in the Diaspora. The dead , among them would be turning in their graves over this shame that has turned Akwa Ibom into a butt of jokes and a laughing stock everywhere in the 21st century.\n\nHow have the mighty fallen ?\n\nWho would explain to future generations that the state that produced world class public Administrators like Chief Ntieyong Akpan , Ekukinam Bassey, Ime Ebong, Clement Isong, public intellectuals like Moses Ekpo, Nelson Etukudo, Ahaziah Umana, Ray Ekpu , Effiong Essien , Timtiniko Enodien, Nsikak Essien , Udeme Ufot , a guru in advertising and Anietie Usen to name just a few among several others is now using state resources to promote a Governorship candidate with questionable basic academic qualifications ? What shall we tell our children ?\n\nWould we tell them that lying one\u2019s way to appointment and government position is just okay and that they should muddle their way through life like Umo Eno ? Is this not witchcraft ? Are the sponsors of Umo Eno not bewitching Akwa Ibom people while singing and dancing during Government house prayer gatherings ? Who does not know that failing examinations is not bad but no reasonable person should support the deliberate procurement of fake examination results to gain advantage in any society. Why is Udom Emmanuel paying Akwa Ibom back with a counterfeit coin ?\n\nWhat would Prelate Mbang and other Fathers of Faith tell their grandchildren about this saga ? Is Prelate Mbang who prayed during the unveiling of Umo Eno at peace with himself ? Does a man who went to the best schools , served as National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria and President of World Methodist Communion sleep well at night in his old age for not questioning the process which threw up Umo Eno as the right choice to lead Akwa Ibom State from 2023 ? What would Archbishop Joseph Ekuwem say about this ? That the home state of the first Cardinal of West Africa has gone this low ? And that his younger brother , a well known ICT expert was a part of the decision making cabal ?Who bewitched Obong Victor Attah to eat this humble pie and become the person assigned to bless this mess at every turn ? Does Obong Attah now listen to himself ?\n\nOne recalls that Deacon Udom Emmanuel had told the people of the state that it was God who revealed Umo Eno to him but at different interviews with Journalists recently, Obong Attah has declared that there was a group behind that choice. Who constituted that group and who were the Members ? He hasn\u2019t said ! How on earth can Arc. Victor Attah emerge as the new spokesperson to a man young enough to be his son ? No wonder , Ekerete Udo , the greatest pretender to the office of Chief Press Secretary to the Governor since the creation of that office has gone into hiding because former Governor Attah has taken over his job ! What a time to be alive in Akwa Ibom State !\n\nBut must Umo Eno be Governor at all cost and by all means ? What does Deacon Udom Emmanuel want to hide that another person could not have covered up for him ?\n\nWhy is the sneaky ambition of one man bigger than the collective health and sustainable wellbeing of a state with more than 7 million people ? Why are the promoters of this particular Candidate so obstinate and bullish in wrongdoing in a wrong direction ?\n\nOkay, Enobong Uwah wants to become the Secretary to the State Government, and Frank Archibong wants to continue in his present office, while Enoidem plans to run the show from the Senate in Abuja and prepare to take over in 2031! These are the three \u2018wise\u2019 henchmen who have brought this roof down on Akwa Ibom State and pressed the entire state to it\u2019s knees.\n\nSo far , the image of this state has been tarnished , it\u2019s high time people moved to save what remains of it for the sake of posterity.\n\nAkwa Ibom leaders should not be seen to be condoning bad behavior bordering on criminality. It is trite saying that evil rules when good people keep silent.\n\nA stitch in time, they say, saves nine , Governor Udom Emmanuel should pull back and back off from this wretched path now to save this State from eternal shame.\n\nWhether the SANs hired to defend Umo Eno succeed in buying the case or not , the conflicting certificates, birthdates, marriage date, the legal imbroglio has damaged Candidate Umo Eno beyond redemption and derobed him of every value to serve in any capacity in Akwa Ibom State going forward. He should be released to return to his hotel business.\n\nUdom Emmanuel should come off his high horse , humble himself , proceed on a weekend dry fasting with all the fathers of faith for using the name of God in vain and for \u2018playing the street\u2019 with the generality of Akwa Ibom people. A stitch in time , indeed , saves nine !\n\nBassey Udosen writes from Mkpok, ONNA in Akwa Ibom State.",

          "title": "BREAKING: UN tells Nigeria to unconditionally release, compensate Nnamdi Kanu",
          "text": "The United Nations, UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has indicted both Nigeria and Kenya Governments for the arrest and extraordinary rendition, torture and continued detention of the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, without due process.\n\nUN therefore, asked Nigerian Government to, \u201cimmediate release Kanu unconditionally\u201d and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.\n\nIt also recommended that Government officials responsible for the torture meted to the IPOB Leader be investigated and punished.\n\nThe UN body further directed Nigeria to report back within six months of the transmission of its opinions on Kanu\u2019s matter, steps taken to comply with all the recommendations thereof.\n\nIt referred the case of Kanu\u2019s torture to Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration\n\nThe UN Working Group also threatened to take further action to ensure the recommendations are complied with, noting that both Nigeria and Kenya are signatories to the Convention and should comply.\n\nThe 16-page report dated July 20, 2022 was adopted on April 4 by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its 93rd session, held between March 30 \u2013 April 8, 2022.\n\nThe unedited version of the document sighted by Vanguard, was marked:\u201dOpinion No. 25/2022 concerning Mr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu (Nigeria and Kenya).\n\nThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established in resolution 1991/42 of the UN Commission on Human Rights.\n\nIn accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group, on December 30, 2021, transmitted to the Nigeria and Kenya Governments, a communication concerning\n\nMr. Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria replied to the communication on 25 January 2022 while the Government of Kenya did not reply.\n\nBoth countries are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe Working Group said in the report that Kanu was a victim of State persecution as Nigeria failed to provide convincing explanations with proof that he is guilty of treason and other criminal allegations levelled against him.\n\n\u201cNoting the failure of the Government to explain what actions of Mr. Kanu amounted\n\nto such criminal acts and how, and observing the lack of any evidence that any of his actions may in fact amount to such crimes, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu is in fact being persecuted for the peaceful exercise of his rights, most notably his freedom of opinion and expression.\n\n\u201cIn the present case, the Government of Nigeria has presented no exceptions permitted under article 19 (3) of the Covenant nor is there any evidence to suggest that Mr. Kanu\u2019s exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression was anything but peaceful.\n\n\u201d In fact, the Government has chosen not to provide any explanation for the arrest, detention and subsequent proceedings against Mr. Kanu. In these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II\u201d, UN Working Group said.\n\nThe Working Group also said there was no evidence that International laws were observed in the arrest and rendition of Kanu from Kenya.\n\nThe 16-page dossier read in part: \u201cIn the present case, Mr. Kanu was not furnished with an arrest warrant by Nigerian\n\nauthorities nor was he promptly informed of the grounds for his arrest in Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, the Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu\u2019s continued deprivation of liberty\n\nviolates his rights under articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article\n\n9 of the Covenant, and principles 2, 4, and 10 of the Body of Principles and constitutes\n\narbitrary detention under category I.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurning to the uncontested allegations that following his rendition to Nigeria,\n\nMr. Kanu remained in pre-trial detention with his trial having been scheduled to commence\n\nin January 2022, the Working Group recalls that it is a well-established norm of international law that pre-trial detention should be the exception rather than the rule, and should be ordered for the shortest time possible. Put differently, liberty is recognised under article 9 (3) of the Covenant as the core consideration with detention merely as an exception.\n\n\u201cTherefore, detention pending trial must be based on an individualised determination that it is reasonable and necessary for such purposes as to prevent flight, interference with evidence or the recurrence of crime. Such determination was not carried out in the present case, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFurther, in accordance with article 9 (3) of the Covenant, an arrested person is to be\n\nbrought before a judge within 48 hours.27 This was not satisfied in the case of Mr. Kanu and\n\nthe Working Group therefore finds a violation of articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration\n\nof Human Rights, article 9 (3) of the Covenant and principles 11, 37 and 38 of the Body of\n\nPrinciples.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in order to establish that a detention is indeed legal, anyone detained has\n\nthe right to challenge the legality of his or her detention before a court, as guaranteed by\n\narticle 9 (4) of the Covenant. The Working Group wishes to recall that according to the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Remedies and Procedures on the Rights of Anyone Deprived of their Liberty to Bring Proceedings before a Court, the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court is a self-standing human right, which is essential to preserve legality in a democratic society.\n\n\u201cThis right, which is in fact a peremptory norm of international law, applies to all forms of deprivation of liberty, 29 to \u201call situations of\n\ndeprivation of liberty, including not only to detention for purposes of criminal proceedings but also to situations of detention under administrative and other fields of law, including military detention, security detention, detention under counter-terrorism measures\u201d.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it also applies \u201cirrespective of the place of detention or the legal terminology used in the legislation. Any form of deprivation of liberty on any ground must be subject to\n\neffective oversight and control by the judiciary. This was also denied to Mr. Kanu, thus, violating his right under article 9 (4) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFinally, turning to Mr. Kanu\u2019s pre-trial detention in Nigeria, the Working Group\n\nrecalls that according to international human rights law, in particular article 9 (3) of the\n\nCovenant, any person detained while awaiting trial is entitled to trial within a reasonable\n\ntime, or otherwise shall be released. Article 14 (3) (c) of the Covenant also guarantees the\n\nright of anyone charged with a criminal offence to be tried without undue delay. In the\n\nabsence of a substantive response from the Government of Nigeria, the Working Group finds no legitimate grounds for the delays in the trials against Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Working Group finds that the Government of Nigeria failed to\n\nestablish a legal basis for the detention of Mr. Kanu. His detention is thus arbitrary under\n\ncategory I.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group said that both the Nigerian and Kenyan Governments should take responsibility for Kanu\u2019s rights violations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group wishes once again to underscore the collusion between the\n\nGovernments of Kenya and Nigeria in the rendition of Mr. Kanu and reiterates that both\n\nGovernments bear joint responsibility for any violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in Kenya and\n\nNigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group has already established in its discussion of the detention of Mr. Kanu in Kenya that he was arrested and detained due to the peaceful exercise of his rights (see paras 52-54 above). The Working Group notes that the source has argued the same in relation to Mr. Kanu\u2019s arrest, detention and trial proceedings in Nigeria. Notably, the\n\nGovernment of Nigeria has chosen not to address the substance of these allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group notes that it is not contested that Mr. Kanu is accused of the crime of conspiracy to commit a treasonable felony through an agreement with others to be broadcast from London, in view of the establishment of a Biafran sovereignty. The source notes that, while treason consists of \u201clevying war\u201d against Nigeria under Nigerian law, the Federal Government of Nigeria does not allege any action implicating Mr. Kanu in the contemplation, planning, or incitement of war against Nigeria. The source argues that\n\nMr. Kanu was in fact advocating for a peaceful referendum for the establishment of a Biafran\n\nsovereignty, in conformity with international and other relevant laws.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group recalls that freedom of opinion and expression, as expressed in article 19 of the Covenant, is an indispensable condition for the full development of the person. It is essential for any society and constitutes the foundation stone for every free and democratic society. It also recalls that freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, and that this right includes the expression and receipt of communications of every form of idea and opinion capable of transmission to others, including political\n\nopinions.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, in Resolution 12/16, the Human Rights Council called on States to refrain\n\nfrom imposing restrictions which are not consistent with article 19 (3), including on the\n\ndiscussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human rights; engaging in peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group further said that the Nigeria Government could not disprove claims by Kanu that he was denied effective lagal representation including access to his US lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe source has submitted, and the Government did not address, that Mr. Kanu was denied effective legal representation. The Working Group considers legal representation as being a core facet of the right to a fair trial. Legal assistance should be available at all stages of criminal proceedings, namely, pre-trial, trial, and appellate stages, to ensure compliance with fair trial guarantees. Any denial of access to lawyers substantially undermines and compromises an accused individual\u2019s capacity to defend him or herself in any judicial proceedings.\n\n\u201cAs the Working Group has stated in principle 9 and guideline 8 of its Basic Principles,\n\npersons deprived of their liberty have the right to legal assistance by counsel of their choice,\n\nat any time during their detention, including immediately after the moment of apprehension, and must be promptly informed of this right upon apprehension. Access to legal counsel should not be unlawfully or unreasonably restricted.\n\n\u201cArticle 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant entitles defendants to adequate time and facilities\n\nfor the preparation of their defence and to communicate with counsel of their own choosing. Defendants must have access to documents and other evidence, including \u201call materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that could assist the defence.\n\n\u201cRecalling general comment No. 32, a detainee has the right to have \u201cprompt access\u201d to legal counsel, meaning that a lawyer must be able to have private communications and\n\nmeetings with the detainee and be able to attend all the investigations without interference or restrictions. A detainee also ought to have access to \u201ceffective counsel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this was denied to Mr. Kanu. In the Working Group\u2019s view, by failing to allow\n\nMr. Kanu to be represented by lawyers of his choice, including an international counsel,\n\nthe Government denied Mr. Kanu\u2019s right to legal assistance at all times, which is inherent in the right to liberty and security of the person as well as the right to a fair and public hearing\n\nby a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, in accordance with articles 3, 9, 10 and 11 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 14 of the\n\nCovenant, articles 37 (b) and (d) and 40 (2) (b) (ii) and principles 15, 17 and 18 of the Body\n\nof Principles and principles 1, 5, 7, 8, 21 and 22 of the Basic Principles on the Role of\n\nLawyers.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is also disturbed by the source\u2019s report of the treatment of\n\nMr. Kanus\u2019s lawyers and recalls its jurisprudence highlighting that such treatment of lawyers is entirely unacceptable and violates articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant.41 It is the legal and positive duty of the State to protect everyone on its territory or under its jurisdiction against any human rights violation and to provide remedy whenever a violation still occurs.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group also considers that Mr. Kanu\u2019s presumption of innocence was\n\nviolated as the Department surrounded the court complex with an array of armed forces,\n\ncreating an atmosphere of intimidation and danger (see para. 9), a submission which the\n\nGovernment has chosen not to contest. The Working Group recalls that defendants should\n\nnot be presented to the court in a manner indicating that they may be dangerous criminals, as this also undermines the presumption of innocence.The Working Group finds a breach of article 14 (2) of the Covenant.\n\n\u201cFurther, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following his\n\nrendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquarters\n\nof the Department in Abuja, Nigeria. He is reportedly currently still held in a very small cell where he is exposed to daily psychological and mental torture without access to other inmates or any other person except for the Department officers. Mr. Kanu is also allegedly denied access to reading or writing materials and has been refused access to professional medical care despite a serious heart ailment.\n\n\u201cThe source reports that Mr. Kanu\u2019s life is in jeopardy and that he suffers from a medical condition occasioned by gradual depletion of potassium in his system, which has defied any medical solution given to him within the Department facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is seriously concerned about the treatment to which Mr. Kanu\n\nhas been subjected. Especially noting its finding that Mr. Kanu was subjected to\n\nextraordinary rendition as well as his treatment prior to that, the Working Group considers it unlikely that Mr. Kanu would have been able to effectively assist with and participate in his own defence during the proceedings against him, and that such treatment roceedings against him, rendering them inherently unfair and unjust, in violation of article 14 of the Covenant. For all the reasons above, the Working Group finds that the fair trial rights and procedural guarantees of Mr. Kanu under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant and other relevant human rights standards, were not observed and that such violations are of such gravity as to render Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention arbitrary under category III.\u201d\n\nThe UN Working Group said Nigeria also failed to disprove that Kanu was a victim of political persecution.\n\n\u201cMr. Kanu is an activist and the leader of the organisation Indigenous People of Biafra,\n\nwhich he founded in 2012. The source alleges that the Government of Nigeria is targeting\n\nMr. Kanu due to his political expression, in particular, due to his membership in a group\n\npolitically opposed to the Nigerian Government on the question of Biafra, his widely published criticism of the Government, and his work with and advocacy for the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Government has chosen not to address these allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group finds that Mr. Kanu has indeed been targeted by the Government\n\nas a human rights defender on account of his freedom of opinion and expression as well as\n\nhis position regarding the sovereignty of Biafra. As Mr. Kanu has been targeted on account of his activism in galvanising momentum for a referendum on the sovereignty of Biafra, the Working Group considers that his detention violates articles 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2 (1) and 26 of the Covenant, and is arbitrary under category V.\n\nConcluding remarks: \u201cThe Working Group wishes to record its very serious concern for the well-being of\n\nMr. Kanu, who, according to the source and uncontested by the Government of Nigeria,\n\nremains in solitary confinement since his arbitrary detention in Nigeria on 29 June 2021. He has been denied medical treatment and medication for his heart condition. The Working Group recalls that prolonged solitary confinement in excess of 15 consecutive days is prohibited under rules 43(1)(b) and 44 of the Mandela Rules.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group is also obliged to remind the Government of Nigeria that in accordance with article 10 of the\n\nCovenant, all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated with humanity and with respect to the inherent dignity of the human person and that denial of medical assistance constitutes a violation of the Nelson Mandela Rules, rules 24, 25, 27 and 30 in particular.\n\n\u201d According to the source, throughout Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention in Kenya and transfer to\n\nNigeria, no family members knew about his location or could access him, and Mr. Kanu was not permitted to contact his family during this detention. These allegations have not been contested by either Governments. The Working Group stresses that, under international human rights law, all detained and imprisoned individuals have the right to communicate and be visited by their families.\n\n\u201cThe right to receive visits applies to all detainees, \u201cregardless of the offence of which they are suspected or accused.\u201d Under Principle 19 of the Body of Principles, this right could be subject only to conditions and restrictions that are appropriate to a legitimate aim. Neither Governments have argued that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family conformed with this requirement. As a result, the Working Group finds that the restrictions placed on Mr. Kanu\u2019s contact with his family violated his right to contact with the outside world under rules 43 (3) and 58 (1) of the Nelson Mandela Rules and principles 15 and 19 of the Body of Principles.\n\n\u201cNoting the treatment to which Mr. Kanu has been subjected at the hands of both\n\nKenyan and Nigerian authorities as well as his continued solitary confinement, the Working\n\nGroup refers this case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for further consideration.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group also wishes to reemphasize its very serious concern over the\n\napparent collusion between the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria in this case and reiterates its findings that both Governments are jointly responsible for the violations of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights in both jurisdictions. The present Opinion concerns solely the treatment and rights of Mr. Kanu and is sposition\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion:\n\nIn relation to Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nThe deprivation of liberty of Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny Okwu-Kanu, being in\n\ncontravention of articles 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19 of the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights and articles 2, 9, 13, 14, 16, 19 and 26 of the International Covenant\n\non Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within Categories I, II, III and V.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments of Kenya and Nigeria to take the steps necessary to remedy the situation of Mr. Kanu without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms, including those set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201d The Working Group considers that, taking into account all the circumstances of the\n\ncase, the appropriate remedy would be for the Government of Nigeria to release Mr. Kanu\n\nimmediately and for both Governments to accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law.\n\n\u201d In the current context of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the threat that it poses in places of detention, the Working Group calls upon the Government of Nigeria to take urgent action to ensure the immediate unconditional release of Mr. Kanu.\n\n\u201d The Working Group urges the two Governments to ensure a full and independent\n\ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of Mr. Kanu and to take appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of hisrights.\n\n\u201d In accordance with paragraph 33 (a) of its methods of work, the Working Group refers\n\nthe present case to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, for appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.\n\nFollow-up procedure:\n\n\u201cIn accordance with paragraph 20 of its methods of work, the Working Group requests\n\nthe source and the Governments to provide it with information on action taken in follow-up\n\nto the recommendations made in the present opinion, including: (a) Whether Mr. Kanu has been released and, if so, on what date;\n\n(b) Whether compensation or other reparations have been made to Mr. Kanu;\n\n(c) Whether an investigation has been conducted into the violation of Mr. Kanu\n\nrights and, if so, the outcome of the investigation; (d) Whether any legislative amendments or changes in practice have been made to harmonize the laws and practices of Kenya and Nigeria with its international obligations in line with the present opinion;\n\n(e) Whether any other action has been taken to implement the present opinion.\n\n\u201cThe Government is invited to inform the Working Group of any difficulties it may\n\nhave encountered in implementing the recommendations made in the present opinion and whether further technical assistance is required, for example through a visit by the Working Group.\n\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the source and the Government to provide the abovementioned information within six months of the date of transmission of the present opinion.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Working Group reserves the right to take its own action in follow-up to the\n\nopinion if new concerns in relation to the case are brought to its attention. Such action would enable the Working Group to inform the Human Rights Council of progress made in\n\nimplementing its recommendations, as well as any failure to take action.\n\n\u201d The Working Group recalls that the Human Rights Council has encouraged all States\n\nto cooperate with the Working Group and has requested them to take account of its views\n\nand, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, and to inform the Working Group of the steps they have taken\u201d\n\nVictory for freedom fighters \u2013 Kanu\u2019s family\n\nMeanwhile, Kanu\u2019s family has expressed delight over the UN recommendations, describing the report as victory for freedom fighters.\n\nKanu\u2019s younger brother, Prince Emmanuel Kanu, who conveyed the position of the family in an exclusive interview with Vanguard, said that Nigeria must comply with the UN recommendations.\n\n\u201cIn as much as they are lawless, they must obey. After now they must still face the music because Internationally they must be held accountable.\u201d",
          "summary": "UN therefore, asked Nigerian Government to, \u201cimmediate release Kanu unconditionally\u201d and pay him adequate compensations for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.\nIn these circumstances, the Working Group concludes that Mr. Kanu\u2019s detention is thus arbitrary under category II\u201d, UN Working Group said.\nSuch determination was not carried out in the present case, in violation of Mr. Kanu\u2019s rights under article 9 (3) of the Covenant.\n\u201cFurther, according to the source and uncontested by the Government, following hisrendition to Nigeria, Mr. Kanu was detained in solitary confinement within the headquartersof the Department in Abuja, Nigeria.\n\u201cThe Working Group requests the Governments to disseminate the present opinion through all available means and as widely as possible.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nManufacturing giant of mining explosives, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, yesterday, organized a capacity building training of over 50 mining companies on use of explosives at their sites this is following issues on safe- mining in the solid minerals sector.\n\nSpeaking on the essence of the \u2018Two-day Technical Training In Explosives Management and Optimization\u2019 , the Founder and Chairman, NIGACHEM Nigeria Limited, Engr Sylvanus Ghasarah, represented by the Executive Director, Administration and Human Resources, Maureen Tiamiyu, explained that the company deed it fit to give back to its customers across the country through capacity building that would cushion effects of high cost of materials via optimization.\n\nGhasarah also noted that the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent, and there was need to optimize this cost to continue in business.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know how the inflation rate has gone up. We know the exchange rate, how much is gone up. So the cost of doing business has been over 300 per cent.\n\n\u201cI know that our product has gone up a lot. So for us to give back a little bit to a customer to appreciate their patronage, we have put up this optimization so that even though the cost has gone up, if they can know how to manage the explosives properly, they can manage their costs more efficiently.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is for them to be able to carry out that blast with profits. We don\u2019t want the increase in prices to affect them because sometimes some businesses are closing down. So the aim is for people to be aware. I mean, mining engineers versus the accountants in the organizations versus the owners of the business, everybody needs to come together and put their heads together; the miners need to understand that there is a cost to blasting and the better they can efficiently manage their blasting, the better for the business owners.\n\n\u201cAnd they effect of all the other factors; diesel price has gone up, exchange rate, the effect could be cushioned with optimization basically.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he added that the training would be taken to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have started this at this time. We have planned to go to different regions where we have our customer cluster, like I said, is a give back to our customers and our customers all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo we will continue to have one programme or another to give back to our customers\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Sales, Nigachem Nigeria Limited, Engr Bayo Yusuf, described the capacity building workshop as reawakening training for customers.\n\n\u201cBasically, everybody here is not a greenhorn but professionals, and they understand the language, and what we need to do is to just follow up on the product we supply them to make sure they get the best value in the application against the value for their money for using our product\u201d, Yusuf said.\n\nOn the areas lacking among mining companies as customers, he said, \u201cThe emphasis is on security and safety of our products because of global wave of terrorism and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cExplosive if it gets into wrong hands could do a lot of damage. We have to emphasize that whoever buys our products, we have the technology, capacity, and infrastructure to be able to track and trace whatever takes our material.\n\n\u201cWe say to our customers to safeguard our products, ensure you have proper human reliability of your workers so it doesn\u2019t leak out of your premises. Leakage can hardly happen with us but when it gets to the end-user we don\u2019t have control\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also explained that there was difference between his company\u2019s product called Super Power Explosives or 90 Super Power 80, and it is not an Improvised Explosive Device, IED, rather is for civil works- mining, quarrying and oil and gas exploration\n\nHowever, he called on government to make sure roads across the country are reconstructed, rehabilitated and properly maintained, and if not safety and security of Nigerians cannot be guaranteed.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the impact of insecurity on the mining sector, the Director, Mines Inspectorate, Ministry of Mining and Steel Development, Engr Frank Odom, said there was need to track and monitor movement from point of manufacture to usage or storage as the case maybe, and stressed the need for companies in the mining sector to copy what Coca-cola Bottling Company, Dangote Company, and others are doing to track their trucks.\n\n\u201cThese trucks carrying mining explosives are not monitored while moving on the roads. It is important putting additional measures to know probably on your phone or tablets you can see when a material leaves from the point it was sold or conveyed from or loaded from or even the sea port and to look at it as making progress to where it will be delivered for usage or storage.\n\nThis will prevent diversion, you can raise alarm over delay on the road by calling nearest security agency, you will know what it is happening to the truck every minute.\n\nHe made it known that there will designated companies specifically for explosives movement of explosives, that would be registered and licensed for that purpose, but not there yet because mechanisms are being put together, and he added that the tracking would be done by the Ministry.\n\n\u201cHowever, when those companies come on stream they would be compelled to do the same because there is no too much monitoring because it is for the same purpose in order for us not to be lost in anything or caught unawares. So that is the main purpose,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the workshop organised by NIGACHEM will boost and improve productivity of miners as far as safe mining and profitability are concerned, which is also the key in capacity building.\n\nOne of the participants at the workshop, Assistant, Manager, Section 9 (1) Manager, Mines Department, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant, Kogi State, Engr Caleb Aransiola, commended Nigachem for the capacity building and new knowledge acquired as far as optimisation is concerned.\n\nAransiola said Nigachem did not only focused on profit but showed concern to help its customers by giving back to their customers\n\n\u201cDespite two decades of practical experience on the field I still gained a lot from the resource people, who have four decades of experience, especially on the issues we are talking about I\u2019m terms of optimisation\n\n\u201cWhat I am taking back home is to make sure my employer, Dangote Cement Plc, Obajana Plant have more profit and the turnover of the business, improve on the cost analysis and making more because if the company doesn\u2019t make profit we also will be out of job.\n\n\u201cI need to improve more on safe-mining because we basically focus on blasting because blasting is the most technical aspect of mining. I need to avoid misfire which at the end we will record success; no fatality and also maximize cost\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the company has strong policy on tracking movement, use, storage and management, which no explosives have left the company since exception due to the high technology and discipline put in place to curb ay breaches, but more will be done to improve on what the company has security of explosives and movement.\n\n[7/22, 1:57 PM] Palma Jennifer: \u201cI will prioritize education, engage youths in nation building\u201d- Adebayo\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Prince Adewole Adebayo has promised to prioritize education and engage youths in leadership roles if elected as President of the country next year.\n\nAdebayo stated this when he played host to the leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS in Abuja.\n\nWhile promising to represent the interest of the masses and youths through a policy that sustains and guarantees a smooth educational system, Prince Adebayo charged the student body to rise to the defense of the nation\u2019s educational sector.\n\nThe leader of the delegation and national secretary of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, Mr. Salahudeen Lukman said the visit was to interface with Presidential flag bearers of political parties on their agenda for the educational sector.\n\nLukman advocated more fundings for the sector to save it from incessant strikes and urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to the current industrial action embarked upon by he Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU.",

          "text": "By Kayode Abdulazeez\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele on Thursday commissioned a 600 million naira poultry farm project at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning ceremony the CBN governor, who was represented by Edwin Nzelu, Deputy Director and Secretary to ACGSF, Agricultural credit guarantees scheme fund, said CBN introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on creating decent job, boosting poultry production fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector and One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualized specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cDespite Nigeria being the largest producer of eggs and the second largest producer of chicken meat in Africa, demand gap for eggs and meat stands at and outstrips current supply by 1.2Million Metric Tonnes and 140,000Metric Tonnes for meat and eggs respectively.\n\n\u201cOver the years, this demand gap has driven the smuggling of unhealthy frozen chicken into the country. To close this gap, the Central Bank of Nigeria has introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on boosting poultry production, creating decent jobs, and fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector. One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualised specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cToday we witness the commissioning of the first project to be funded and completed through the Scheme. Certainly, the laudable objectives of the Scheme including improving the revenue of tertiary institutions, employment creation and enhancing research into poultry by tertiary institutions are already being realised\u201d\n\nThe CBN Boss, however, tasked other similar institutions across the country to follow the University of Ilorin example.\n\nIn his speech, the Vice-chancellor of the University of Ilorin, professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, spoke on how the journey to the realization of the project began and extol the significance of the project in the history of the University.\n\n\u201cThe journey has been long and hard for us as a University. The university took a 600 million naira loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, at a concessionary interest rate of 9% (5% for the first year) and a repayment period of 6 years, with a moratorium on the repayment of the principal for one year. Zenith Bank plc is the participating financial institution on the project.\n\n\u201cAccessing the loan required the University to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project. The SPV is Unilorin Bizface synergy Limited, a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the loan, the University worked out an irrevocable standing payment (ISPO) with Zenith Bank plc, ensuring Zenith Bank was paid quarterly the amount due, according to the amortization\u201d, he said.\n\nThe project which is placed on 30 hectares started in February in the year 2022 and was commissioned on 21st July.\n\nThe VC, noted that \u201cthe farm has 6 fully built Broilers\u2019 pens with a capacity, of 5,000 birds each and another two of similar capacity, under construction to raise the total installed capacity to 40,000 Broilers, four fully built layers pens currently housing 17,000 layers, though with an installed capacity of 33,000, a Feed mill with an installed capacity of 5tons/hours, a semi-automated Broiler processing unit (BPU) with a capacity to process 1,000 birds/day and a manure processing unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn job creation, at the height of construction, the site had over 200 artisans earning their daily sustenance from it. Today the farm has 55 full time employees and has created space for students of the hosting institution to work on part time basis\u201d, he further stated.\n\nHe dded that the University is also developing 2,000 hectares of land for Maize and Soya beans cultivation for the exclusive use of the poultry farm\n\nThe vice-chancellor however lauded the project and thanked the steering committee led by the deputy vice-chancellor, research, technology and innovation Professor Mikhail Olayinka Buhari for the efforts put in place to make the project reality and subsequent overseeing of the project.",

          "text": "The World Health Organization on Saturday declared the monkeypox outbreak, which has affected nearly 16,000 people in 72 countries, to be a global health emergency \u2014 the highest alarm it can sound.\n\n\u201cI have decided that the global #monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference.\n\nHe said a committee of experts who met on Thursday was unable to reach a consensus, so it fell on him to decide whether to trigger the highest alert possible.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s assessment is that the risk of monkeypox is moderate globally and in all regions, except in the European region where we assess the risk as high,\u201d he added.\n\nMonkeypox has affected over 15,800 people in 72 countries, according to a tally by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published on July 20.\n\nA surge in monkeypox infections has been reported since early May outside the West and Central African countries where the disease has long been endemic.\n\nOn June 23, the WHO convened an emergency committee (EC) of experts to decide if monkeypox constitutes a so-called Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) \u2014 the UN health agency\u2019s highest alert level.\n\nBut a majority advised Tedros that the situation, at that point, had not met the threshold.\n\nThe second meeting was called on Thursday with case numbers rising further, where Tedros said he was worried.\n\n\u201cI need your advice in assessing the immediate and mid-term public health implications,\u201d Tedros told the meeting, which lasted more than six hours.\n\nA US health expert sounded a grim warning late on Friday.\n\n\u201cSince the last #monkeypox EC just weeks ago, we\u2019ve seen an exponential rise in cases. It\u2019s inevitable that cases will dramatically rise in the coming weeks & months. That\u2019s why @DrTedros must sound the global alarm,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cA failure to act will have grave consequences for global health.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Warning against discrimination \u2013\n\nA viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970, monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980.\n\nNinety-five percent of cases have been transmitted through sexual activity, according to a study of 528 people in 16 countries published in the New England Journal of Medicine \u2014 the largest research to date.\n\nOverall, 98 percent of infected people were gay or bisexual men, and around a third were known to have visited sex-on-site venues such as sex parties or saunas within the previous month.\n\n\u201cThis transmission pattern represents both an opportunity to implement targeted public health interventions, and a challenge because in some countries, the communities affected face life-threatening discrimination,\u201d Tedros said earlier, citing concern that stigma and scapegoating could make the outbreak harder to track.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s drug watchdog on Friday recommended for approval the use of Imvanex, a smallpox vaccine, to treat monkeypox.\n\nImvanex, developed by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, has been approved in the EU since 2013 for the prevention of smallpox.\n\nIt was also considered a potential vaccine for monkeypox because of the similarity between the monkeypox virus and the smallpox virus.\n\nThe first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days.\n\nRashes subsequently appear on the face, the palms of hands and soles of feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs.",

          "text": "The recent blame game between the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, and the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has taken a new twist with the latest jab coming from the former vice president\u2019s camp.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Atiku\u2019s media adviser, Paul Ibe, faulted an earlier statement by Tinubu\u2019s spokesman following a TV interview granted by the PDP flagbearer who is fondly called Waziri by his supporters.\n\n\u201cWe would like to challenge Bola Tinubu to subject himself to an hour-long interview like the Waziri did, and if he is able to be as articulate and mentally present as our candidate, then he can talk,\u201d said Ibe.\n\n\u201cUntil then, we will only want to remind him and his yes men that they are not in a position to point fingers when they have not sat on the hot seat.\u201d\n\nThe controversy between both presidential hopefuls began when Atiku, in an interview with Arise TV on Friday morning, claimed he rejected Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the then Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) platform because he was against the ideology of a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the interest of the country\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yaradua. That was the parting point,\u201d he had said.\n\nBut in his reaction barely a day after the interview aired, Tinubu countered the claims made by the PDP candidate whom he accused of demeaning himself by pandering to base prejudice at a moment Nigeria needs true leadership.\n\nRather, he explained that he and the ACN helped Atiku in 2007 after he was frozen out by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and forced out of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened to see such a man become unhinged from the truth,\u201d said a statement by the APC candidate\u2019s spokesman, Tunde Rahman. \u201cSo obsessed is he with his quest for office, Atiku is willing to render any form of untruth if he thinks it might gain him a single vote. Atiku may want to be president. However, all he has shown is that he is pathological.\u201d\n\nFollowing the latest reaction from Mr Ibe, Nigerians would only expect another dramatic twist in the blame game by both men.\n\nRead the full text of the statement by Akitu\u2019s spokesman below:",

Remember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed ACN,\u201d Abubakar said in the interview.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yaradua.

During a 22 July television interview, Atiku assaulted historic truth by lying that he did not name Tinubu as his running mate in 2007 on the Action Congress ticket because Atiku did not want a Muslim as his running mate.\u201d\n\nTinubu explained that contrary to Abubakar\u2019s position, he and the then Action Congress of Nigeria had helped him out in 2007 after he was frozen out by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and forced out of the PDP.\n\nHe said, \u201cI feel sorry for dear old Atiku. Love of his own ambition has eclipsed his relationship with the truth and an honest account of the past. We formed the AC without his knowledge. When President Obasanjo virtually exiled him from the PDP, we lent him our support by giving him the AC platform for the 2007 election.\n\n\u201cLet me say openly that Atiku offered me the vice presidential ticket in 2007. Let me also say that my religion has not changed. When he offered the position to me, I was a Muslim and I believe he was aware of my religious faith at the time.\u201d\n\nRead the full statement below:",

Besides Covid, it is the only PHEIC still in place.\n\n\u2014 August 2014: Ebola\n\nOutbreak in western Africa which spread to Europe and the United States.\n\n\u2014 February 2016: Zika virus\n\nThe epidemic began in Brazil and heavily affected the Americas. The only PHEIC declared over a mosquito-borne virus.\n\n\u2014 July 2019: Ebola\n\nThe second Ebola PHEIC was over the outbreak in Kivu in eastern DRC.\n\n\u2014 January 2020: Covid-19\n\nDeclared when \u2014 outside of China where the virus first emerged \u2014 there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths.\n\n\u2013 Covid-19 frustrations \u2013\n\nThe Covid-19 PHEIC declaration came after a third meeting of the emergency committee on the spreading virus. Meetings on January 22 and 23, 2020 decided that the outbreak did not constitute a PHEIC.\n\nDespite the declaration, it was only after March 11, that Tedros described the rapidly worsening situation as a pandemic, leading many countries to wake up to the danger.\n\nThe sluggish global response still rankles at the WHO\u2019s headquarters and raised questions about whether the PHEIC system under IHR was fit for purpose.\n\nBy March 11, the number of cases outside China had soared, with more than 118,000 people having caught the disease in 114 countries, and 4,291 people having lost their lives, following a jump in deaths in Italy and Iran.\n\n\u201cThe warning in January was way more important than the announcement in March,\u201d WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said on the second anniversary of the pandemic declaration.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t listening.

          "title": "Russia Strikes Odessa Port in Ukraine One Day after Grain Deal",
          "text": "Russian missiles hit Ukraine\u2019s southern port of Odesa on Saturday, the Ukrainian military said, threatening a deal signed just the day before to unblock grain exports from Black Sea ports and ease global food shortages caused by the war.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the strike showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement the deal. However, public broadcaster Suspilne quoted the Ukrainian military as saying the missiles had not caused significant damage and a government minister said preparations continued to restart grain exports from the country\u2019s Black Sea ports.\n\nThe deal signed on Friday by Moscow and Kyiv and mediated by the United Nations and Turkey was hailed as a breakthrough after nearly five months of punishing fighting since Russia invaded its neighbour. It is seen as crucial to curbing soaring global food prices by allowing grain exports to be shipped from Black Sea ports including Odesa.\n\nU.N. officials had said on Friday they hoped the agreement would be operational in a few weeks and the strike on Odesa drew strong condemnation from Kyiv, the United Nations and the United States.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defence minister said Russian officials had told Ankara that Moscow had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the strikes on Odesa. A Russian defence ministry statement on Saturday outlining progress in the war did not mention any strike in Odesa. The ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nTwo Russian Kalibr missiles hit the area of a pumping station at the Odesa port, while another two missiles were shot down by air defence forces, according to Ukraine\u2019s Operational Command South. Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, said the cruise missiles were fired from warships in the Black Sea near Crimea.\n\nSupilne later quoted the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern military command, Natalia Humeniuk, was quoted as saying the port\u2019s grain storage area was not hit. No casualties have been reported.\n\nInfrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook that \u201cwe continue technical preparations for the launch of exports of agricultural products from our ports\u201d.\n\nThe strike appeared to violate the terms of Friday\u2019s deal, which would allow safe passage in and out of Odesa and two other Ukrainian ports.\n\n\u201cThis proves only one thing: no matter what Russia says and promises, it will find ways not to implement it,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a video posted on Telegram.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \u201cunequivocally condemned\u201d the reported strikes, a spokesperson said, adding that all parties had committed to the grain export deal and full implmentation was imperative.\n\n\u201cThese products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe,\u201d spokesperson Farhan Haq said in a statement.\n\nTurkish Defence Minister Hulusai Akar said in a statement that \u201cIn our contact with Russia, the Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack, and that they were examining the issue very closely and in detail\u201d.\n\nTurkish Defence Minister Hulusai Akar said in a statement that \u201cIn our contact with Russia, the Russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack, and that they were examining the issue very closely and in detail\u201d.\n\nAll sides agreed on Friday there would be no attacks on these entities and that it would be the task of JCC to resolve if any prohibited activity is observed.\n\nUkraine foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Facebook that \u201cthe Russian missile is (Russian President) Vladimir Putin\u2019s spit in the face\u201d of Guterres and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, adding Ukraine was grateful for the lengths they had gone to reach the agreement.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe Kremlin continues to weaponize food. Russia must be held to account\u201d.\n\nMoscow has denied responsibility for the food crisis, blaming Western sanctions for slowing its own food and fertiliser exports and Ukraine for mining the approaches to its Black Sea ports.\n\nA blockade of Ukrainian ports by Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet since Moscow\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour has trapped tens of millions of tonnes of grain and stranded many ships.\n\nThis has worsened global supply chain bottlenecks and, along with Western sanctions on Russia, stoked food and energy price inflation. Russia and Ukraine are major global wheat suppliers, and the war sent food prices soaring. A global food crisis has pushed some 47 million people into \u201cacute hunger,\u201d according to the World Food Programme.\n\nU.N. officials said on Friday the deal, expected to be fully operational in a few weeks, would restore grain shipments from the three reopened ports to pre-war levels of 5 million tonnes a month.\n\nZelenskiy said on Friday the deal would make around $10 billion worth of grain available for sale with roughly 20 million tonnes of last year\u2019s harvest to be exported. However, on the wider conflict, he told the Wall Street Journal there could be no ceasefire without retaking lost lands.\n\nPutin calls the war a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d and has said it is aimed at demilitarising Ukraine and rooting out dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and the West call this a baseless pretext for an agressive land grab.",

The right result is clear \u2013 not declaring an emergency at this point would be a historic missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, there have been more than 16,000 cases of monkeypox in more than 75 countries, and five deaths in Africa.\n\nThe viral disease \u2013 which spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions \u2013 has been spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men in the recent outbreak, outside Africa where it is endemic.\n\nUntil now, the label had only been applied to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing efforts to eradicate polio.\n\nThe WHO and national governments have been facing intense pressure from scientists and public health experts to take more action on monkeypox.\n\nCases of the viral disease have ballooned since the committee first met at the end of June, when there were only about 3,000 cases.\n\nAt the time, the expert group agreed to reconsider their position on the emergency declaration if the outbreak escalated.\n\nOne of the key issues driving a reassesment was whether cases \u2013 that are almost entirely proliferating amongst men who have sex with men \u2013 would bleed into other groups, particularly children or others who have been vulnerable to the virus in past outbreaks in endemic countries.\n\nOn Friday, the United States identified its first two monkeypox cases in children. read more\n\nAny changes to the virus itself could also spark a rethink, the committee had said.\n\nThe group is now split between those who think an emergency declaration would accelerate efforts to contain the disease, and those who do not think the above criteria have been met because the disease has not yet spread to new groups of people or had a high fatality rate, the sources said.",

For avoidance of doubt, the word EMOWAA is alien to us as Benin people.\u201d\n\nThey said the Coalition had been at the forefront \u201cof advocating and assisting our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom to ensure that our stolen artifacts are returned to the Palace.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition thus raised a number of posers for Obaseki: \u201cWe would like to ask His Excellency, who owns the proposed Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) which is alien to the Benin race\n\n\u201cIs the proposed EMOWAA project owned by the Edo State Government or owned by your Private Venture called Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd?\n\n\u201cIf Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA) belongs to your Private Venture known as Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd with its Office in Lagos, then why are you as our Governor treating it as a Government project using state resources?\n\n\u201cWe also would want to inquire from His Excellency, why you reneged on your earlier promise regarding the Benin Royal Museum in 2018 when you supported the idea of a Benin Royal Museum before the EMOWAA idea came from the blues.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition said it has nothing against Obaseki\u2019s plans to build Museums or set up privately owned ventures like Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd or EMOWAA \u201cas long as the artifacts that will constitute the proposed Museums are not part of the stolen historical Benin artifacts which are the Cultural Heritage of the Benin people; which rightly belongs to our revered Oba of Benin Kingdom, as the custodian of Benin Culture, Customs, and Traditions, whom we earlier said that these Artifacts were made for by the various Royal guilds of Benin, and was looted from Oba Ovonranmwen in 1897.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition continued: \u201cAnd it has already been settled as at last year that the proposed Benin Royal Museum would take custody of these Benin Artifacts on behalf of his Majesty not EMOWAA the flagship project of your Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, as long as these Historical Benin Artifacts will not constitute the Artifacts of the proposed EMOWAA Museum, then we have nothing against your EMOWAA but as long as these stolen Benin Artifacts are what will constitute your proposed EMOWAA, then consider it as pipedream because we will collectively resist such move.\n\n\u201cWe would like to remind His Excellency that your position as the Executive Governor of Edo state is time bound but our revered Palace, Throne and Benin Kingdom is not time bound, so whatever decision you take, the long term effect is what we are looking at.\n\n\u201cWhy is the Executive Director of the proposed EMOWAA an Igbo Man, Mr. Philip Ihanacho? His Excellency, we would like to ask you and the Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd, are there no Benins\u2019 that are qualified for the position of Executive Director in the proposed EMOWAA that is to be established in Benin City?\n\n\u201cWe expected that as a Benin man, His Excellency would have appointed Edo Person to chair his private venture, Legacy Restoration Trust Ltd in order to protect the Edo interest and use it as an opportunity to train young Edo people in that field which is a component of the course at hand.\n\n\u201cIf the primary intention of the proposed EMOWAA is to promote Benin Cultural Heritage, then is it not proper that an Edo person occupies such a position? We also learnt that the proposed site of the proposed EMOWAA is Ogbe-Ezoti.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, we all know that landmass of Edo South is not small, and that Ogbe-Ezoti happens to be an important Historical and Cultural Site in Benin Kingdom and that of the Oba of Benin.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, are you not aware that Ogbe-Ezoti (Aro-Ezoti) is one of the Cultural and Historical Sites in Benin Kingdom? Why would you destroy a legacy in an attempt to create another?\n\nAre there no other locations/lands in the whole of Edo South that are suitable?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Sir, we hope that Benin Artifacts manufactured by the Royal guilds of Benin for the Obas of Benin in pre-colonial times which was looted from the Royal Palace of Benin in 1897 will not be part of what you intend to store in the proposed EMOWAA?\n\n\u201cWe want to state unequivocally that these Benin Artifacts belong to his Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin Kingdom and the entire Benin Kingdom. Just like the proverbial saying goes Aigbuobasimwin Aiguobatile. For clarity, our revered Oba of Benin Kingdom is the owner of these Benin artifacts.\n\n\u201cIf the Governor is so much keen on developing the Art and Tourism sector, then it is proper thing for you to liaise with the our revered Oba who would give the nod to these royal guilds of Benin Artisans in order to collaborate with the government in replicating these stolen Artifacts, and even producing other Artifacts for the Edo State Government, for your EMOWAA.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that since His Excellency is keen on promoting Benin Arts and Culture, which is realistic and profitable, for him to do so by actualising the establishment of an Edo State Art Gallery.\u201d\n\nSignatories to the declaration of the Coalition include Mr. Osazee Amas-Edobor, Coordinator General; Mr. Iyamu Osaro Culture Secretary General; Maxist Kola Edokpayi, Public Relations Officer; Comrade Osaze Eriamiantoe, Director of Planning; Charity Ozigbo-Esere, Director of Gender Affairs; Comrade Collins A. Osaghae, Director of Operations; Mr. Justice Amafe, Director of Research; Mr. Esoesa Omoregbe, Director of Mobilizations and Mr. Samuel Normamuikor, Director of Public Complaint.\n\nCharles Ajunwa",

          "title": "Atiku: Tinubu Wanted to Run Muslim-Muslim Ticket with Me in 2007, I Refused",
          "text": "The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for 2023 and former vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, spoke to ARISE News on his frequent attempts at becoming the president of Nigeria since 1992, declaring that the driving force behind his persistence \u201cis the desire to serve my country and its people.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president stated this and more in an exclusive interview, his first after being elected presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\nOn not picking the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, as his running mate for the 2023 election, Atiku said Wike was not rejected but he simply picked a running mate that he believes he could work with amicably.\n\nAtiku also said he refused the proposition of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to be his running mate in 2007 because of his aversion to a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAtiku said his frequent shots at the presidency has its place in history, citing the case of Abraham Lincoln who ran up to five or six times before becoming the president of the United States of America.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn politics or even in history, we have several leaders around the world who have made attempts to serve their country.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest presidents in American history is Abraham Lincoln. This was somebody who ran up to five or six times to be the president of the United States.\n\n\u201cAt this my age, and what I have been able to accomplish, I don\u2019t think I desire anything other than the passion to serve my country and my fellow countrymen.\n\n\u201cSo, this is what is the driving force behind my persistence and desire to serve my country and its people.\n\n\u201cBasically, I\u2019m driven by the passion and desire to give back to this country and my society what the country has done for me. If I were to be born around this time, I don\u2019t think I would have been that fortunate or likely to become what I have become today. So, I am more or less driven by the passion to give back to society what this country has given so much to me.\u201d\n\nAtiku also went down memory lane, saying, \u201ceven when I wanted to be the governor of my state, from the old Gongola State to Adamawa State, I ran four times before eventually I was elected as the state governor but I never served, as I became the Vice President.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on what informed his choice of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate over Wike, he said Wike was not rejected as being suggested in some quarters but simply picked a running mate that he believes he could work with amicably.\n\nHe also said he did not go outside the recommendations of the committee he set up for the purpose.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is the prerogative of the presidential candidate to pick his running mate, a running mate that he believes he can work with amicably and also deliver the policies of the party and also try to unify the country.\u201d\n\nHe said he had always looked towards the South-east for his running mate whenever he got the presidential ticket, stating, \u201cI was given a ticket in 2007, I picked a South-easterner, I was given a ticket in 2019, I picked an Igbo, and now I have been given a ticket in 2022, and I picked an Igbo man, consecutively. This is just to show you my desire to unify the country.\u201d\n\nHe described Wike as \u201ca brilliant, courageous and tenacious politician that really has a future in the political evolution of this country. So, it is not about rejection.\u201d\n\nAtiku then set the record straight: \u201cThey recommended three names, because they knew it was my prerogative to pick any one of the three. Ortom himself chaired that committee. He knew there was no vote taken. I have the report of the committee and the committee said \u2018we are recommending the following\u2019 and out of the three people, I picked one. I did not go outside that recommendation. People should be fair to me and state the facts.\u201d\n\nRegardless, he said there was fence mending going on to assuage Wike: \u201cWe are reaching out to Wike and talking to him, very soon, we will resolve our internal crises.\u201d\n\nAs for Okowa, he said his running mate is very brilliant and experienced, having served from the local government, to the state as a commissioner and to the National Assembly and then government.\n\nAtiku said, \u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our governors, the National Working Committee, board of trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a president-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on whether he would have picked Peter Obi, who is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, and what he believes are Obi\u2019s chances in the presidential race, he said Okowa and Obi were two different people.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Peter Obi did not consult me but told me three days after he joined the Labour Party,\u201d said the former vice president.\n\nOn Obi\u2019s chances against him, Atiku said, \u201cPeter Obi is not a threat. I really don\u2019t expect the Labour Party to take as many votes from the PDP as people are suggesting. They have no governor, or in the National Assembly. We could have seen it in the last election in Osun State. What was the performance of the Labour Party?\n\n\u201cThen again, they (Obi\u2019s supporters) are talking about social media. Mind you, in the north, 90 per cent of our people (who will be voting) are not on social media.\u201d\n\nOn the APC\u2019s Muslim-Muslim ticket, Atiku said he fundamentally disagrees with Tinubu on the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket in the presidential race.\n\nAtiku said his disagreement with Tinubu on the same religion ticket dated back to 2007 in their days in the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) when Tinubu insisted on being his running mate.\n\n\u201cMy fundamental disagreement and political departure with Asiwaju since 2007 was due to the Muslim-Muslim ticket. \u201cRemember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed ACN.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yar\u2019Adua. That was the parting point.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, and there should be a religious balance in our leadership. It is unwelcoming and unripe for Nigeria as a democratic state.\u201d\n\nOn his relationship with Tinubu, he said, \u201cWe are still friends, of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have political differences. We have been having political differences ever since we became friends. Nothing unusual about that.\u201d\n\nOn zoning in the PDP, he said, \u201cthere is no microzoning in the PDP\u201d but that there is a policy on rotation between the North and the South, stating that if he is voted president, then the Chairman of the PDP, Iyocha Ayu would resign.\n\nHe also discussed security matters in the country, stating that agitations in parts of the country would be unnecessary if every part of the country was given a sense of belonging.\n\nHe said it was curious that all the 17 security outfits in the country were headed by people from a particular section of the country, that there were fewer policemen than required, stating that under his watch, more policemen would be recruited.\n\nThe former VP who said he was an advocate of state police, added that the police should be well trained and equipped and to make it constitutional for police to be at all levels of administration.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of removal of subsidy, stating that it was inevitable and that as Vice President, he chaired a committee charged with this task. \u201cWhen I was vice president, we had designed subsidy removal in four stages, and I was the chairman of the subsidy removal committee. At that time, I worked very closely with former Governor Adams Oshiomhole, who was then president of the NLC. We removed subsidy phase one and phase two. By the time we finished phase two, we had left office. I believe this can be done in the future through negotiations.\u201d\n\nOn stemming the incessant collapses of the national power grid, he advocated the decentralisation of power generation and transmission, with consideration of renewables like solar, hydro electricity from mini dams, gas powered electricity, where applicable, among others.\n\nThe transition of the NNPC from a public corporation to a limited liability company, he said, was still shrouded in secrecy, stating that the government needed to be more transparent about the future of the company.\n\nFor instance, he wondered what the position or fate of the oil- bearing states and communities would be under this new NNPC, and promised to open up the company to include the states and oil-bearing areas.\n\nBennett Oghifo",
