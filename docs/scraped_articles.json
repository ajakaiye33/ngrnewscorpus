          "title": "Behold HRM Ogiame Atuwatse III\u2026.King With Vision And Mission",
          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nYesterday, history was made as the Itsekiri people trooped out en masse and converged in their ancestral home, Ode-Itsekiri popularly called big Warri, to crown their new king. Known for their elegant and flamboyant dressing, the Itsekiri put up the finest of their rich culture and tradition as colourful boat regattas displayed on Warri high seas, an event specially reserved for special occasions such as the coronation of a king, preceded the coronation rights.\n\nPHOTO By: Henry Unini\n\nPrince Tsola Emiko, who, until yesterday was referred to as Omoba, after spending 90 days in seclusion in which he was educated on Itsekiri culture and custom, as well as kingship etiquettes was crowned the 21st Olu of Warri after picking the royal title of Ogiame Atuwatse III.\n\nBorn Utienyinoritsetsola Emiko in Warri, Delta State, on April 2, 1984, to Prince Godwin Toritseju Emiko, the late Ogiame Atuwatse II, and Gladys Durorike Emiko, he had his early education at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Primary School and Adesoye College in Offa, Kwara State between 1995 and 2000.\n\nIn 2002, he then proceeded to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and Political Science with minors in History and Economics. He followed it up with a Masters degree in Science in Management from the same university in 2007 before returning to Nigeria for his NYSC in 2008, where he worked in the Public Affairs Department of the National Petroleum Investment Management Service (NAPIMS).\n\nThe handsome king who social media enthusiasts tagged \u201cpretty king\u201d for his good looks, is married to Ivie Okunbo, now Olori, the daughter of billionaire Capt. Idahosa Okunbor who recently passed away after battling with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAn accomplished businessman and CEO of Noble Nigeria Souvenir Limited now Ogiame Atuwatse III, he speaks exclusively to Vanguard on the stormy journey to the throne and his vision and mission to his beloveth Itsekiri people.\n\nHIS ROYAL MAJESTY, TESOLA EMIKO, ATUWATSE III, THE OLU OF WARRI KINGDOM\n\nYour Majesty, let me start by congratulating you on your acension to the throne of your forefathers as the 21st Olu of Warri. It\u2019s your Thanksgiving ceremony today. What are you most grateful for?\n\nLife. Health and a dream come true.\n\nYesterday, history was made in Itsekiri land. As the person at the center, what was the whole experience like for you?\n\nIt was dreamlike, surreal, and inspirational for myself and many others who I\u2019m sure are encouraged that something promised, no matter the obstacles or setbacks, that it can, and will, come to pass.\n\nYesterday\u2019s colourful ceremony is a testament of the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people. How and in what ways do you intend to continue this legacy?\n\nI think we witnessed some new things that we introduced by way of organization, procession, music and visuals in the ceremony. Those are a testament of many more additions to come. I plan to do many unprecedented things that will enhance, and promote, the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people.\n\nYour father and grand father were Olus who reigned long and enjoyed the love and support of the Itsekiri people. Do you fear if their shoes might be too big for you to fill?\n\nWell, certainly, they\u2019ve left huge boots to fill. However, I know that God\u2019s hand is very much in my ascension to the throne. The same One who saw it fit to put me here will keep me, and help me to lead and serve the people He has called me to.\n\nIf HM Atuwatse were here, what would he be most proud of?\n\nHe would be proud that I trusted God. I kept my peace and pursued peace. He always said a baby elephant doesn\u2019t struggle to grow. Without struggling, here we are.\n\nOne of the things you had going for you was the fact that you grew up in kingship and had the privilege of seeing your late father administer his kingdom. What was it like growing up in the palace as a young prince?\n\nTo be honest, it was a very normal household. My parents did their best to keep us \u201cgrounded\u201d and raise us just like any other children. They were intentional, to ensure that we didn\u2019t grow up proud or entitled because of our status. However, as they say, greatness is never taught, it is caught. While nothing was formally taught, I observed everything about my father: his unwavering love for his people, his ethics, his integrity, his speech, his demeanor and his carriage. I like to believe I caught all these principles from him.\n\nWhat fascinated you most?\n\nThe grace by which he appeared to carry it all with so much ease and poise.\n\nAs a king in a digital age, how do you hope to cope with the rigid demands of culture and tradition?\n\nTechnology is here to make our lives as a race easier. So, we will find ways to apply technology to enhance and ease our already numerous responsibilities. Open mindedness and willingness to adapt will make all the difference.\n\nYour journey to the throne was quite a stormy one. What was it like being in the center of it all?\n\nTo quote a song, \u201cIn the eye of the hurricane, there is quiet\u201d. There was a certain peace I had in the eye of the storm. A peace I still very much have.\n\nNow that the storm is over, what plans do you have to bring all Itsekiris together again as one?\n\nNo victor, no vanquished. We are one big body, and there are different parts that have different functions: we will ensure those suited to roles are given those roles; and a giant toe that feels it\u2019s so prominent because of whatever blessings it has, shouldn\u2019t feel it must be the center of the forehead because it\u2019s a giant in its sense. Everyone has a role to play, and we will ensure those roles are well applied. We will function together as one to bring progress and development to our kingdom.\n\nOne major problem facing Itsekiris is community crises, you also have crises between youths of the three major ethnic groups in Warri. What plans do you have to ensure a permanent end to these crises?\n\nFor a people to co-exist, there must be mutual respect for each other as individuals. Mutual respect for each other\u2019s boundaries, customs and culture. It\u2019s a shared environment, we should see our problems as the same. We should also see our development as a shared and mutually intertwined one. That way, we are invested in ensuring there is peace all around. I am a man of peace and I will seek to bring peace and unity between the Itsekiris and our neighbours.\n\nLack of employment is a huge problem in the kingdom. How do you plan to help these teaming youths in order to prevent them from youth restiveness?\n\nBeing a young king, I have particular interest in the youth in my kingdom. They are our Nation builders, and will help build the Itsekiri Nation of the future. I have a few unconventional initiatives in the pipeline to address the issue of youth restiveness. Without giving away too much, I will say this; there is profit in every labour. Not everyone can get into the IOCs or banks or telecoms. With innovative thinking, we will create our own local economy without trying to over saturate what is already on ground. We will also set up schemes and structures to enable optimal output of large, medium and small scale industries already in operation.\n\nShare with us your immediate plans for the Itsekiri people?\n\nA reorientation of the mind. A wise man once said, to know where you are going, you must know where you are coming from. The warri crisis made many of our people to lose the essence of themselves. As the primary custodian of Itsekiri culture and an avid lover of history, I desire to bring a renaissance of our identity and purpose as a people. We will revisit foundations to enlighten and educate the people of our true identity. If we don\u2019t get those foundations correct, whatever you attempt to build will not be sustainable. We will get our foundations right.\n\nYou experienced one of the worst forms of discrimination by reason of the circumstances of your birth. Going forward, how would you ensure that no law or edict carries such descriminatory clauses?\n\nThe motto of our reign as revealed yesterday is Righteousness and Justice. We will use that foundation to view everything that concerns us as a people. And with God guiding us, we will effect the necessary change that ensures equity among our people.\n\nTo ensure a good relationship with all Itsekiris, in what ways would you like them to support you? What should they be doing and what should they not be doing?\n\nThey should know, that I am here to serve them. In everything I do, my intent is to always improve and add value to them, by making things better for them. Even, if it may not immediately appear palatable, because sometimes improvement can be uncomfortable or strange, they should trust that it\u2019s with good intention that I take an action or a decision. To conquer new frontiers we must be willing to embrace the foreign sense the unprecedented brings. I am also very open to feedback, and I welcome my people\u2019s input in my assignment to make things better for us as a people.\n\nWhat would you miss most now as the Olu?\n\nMy anonymity! People want to be celebrities so bad in this generation. I\u2019ve always appreciated my \u201canonymity\u201d. Now that it\u2019s been obviously taken away from me, I think that more than anything, this is what I will miss the most.\n\nI thank you for your time and wish you a peaceful reign.",

          "text": "Words by- Josephine Agbonkhese\n\nOur cover personality Mercy Eke needs almost no introduction. Since 2019 when she emerged winner of the Big Brother Naija, BBN, Season 4, Eke has grown in leaps and bounds, evolving from just a reality TV show contestant, to a video vixen, brands\u2019 ambassador, actress and successful real estates entrepreneur.\n\nThe Imo State University graduate is an embodiment of boldness, style and energy; three features that have continued to distinguish and endear her to many.\n\nIn this interview, she speaks of her newly-launched platform for giving back: The Mercy Eke Foundation, life as the only woman to have won the BBN grand prize so far; her love life and much more.\n\nHow has life been since 2019 when you won the Big Brother Naija Season 4?\n\nLife has really been good. Life has been amazing. I can\u2019t take anything for granted. God has been so wonderful to me and I\u2019ve really, really been working hard. So I would say life after Big Brother has been amazing.\n\nHas the win translated into gains as much as you expected?\n\nWell, I would say win plus hard work equals growth. I mean, there\u2019s been a lot of changes and a lot of growth. I\u2019m doing a lot of things. So, yes the win translated into growth.\n\nHow have you been handling the fame and celebrity status/lifestyle that comes with winning?\n\nWell, let me breath in first. It hasn\u2019t been easy. Ah! Celebrities! God! It\u2019s so hard to be a celebrity in Nigeria or in Africa. It\u2019s so hard like, it\u2019s so demanding but, you know, I just have to take it slowly and a step at a time. But we\u2019ll get there.\n\nGrowing up, did you dream of a life of fame?\n\nYes, I did. I had a lot of dreams and one of the major one was being famous. That was why I auditioned four times for BBNaija because I felt that my redemption might come from there; and it did!\n\nYou remain the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition. What do you think women in each editions haven\u2019t realised about winning?\n\nYes, I\u2019m the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition for Big Brother Nigeria. Like I always tell people, it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s not a do or die affair and at the end of the day, there can only be one winner. I tried my best, and Africa and Nigeria were behind me; and they crowned me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how other women see it but for me, I am happy and I can\u2019t wait to welcome the next female winner because my back is already hurting me. I need someone else to join me on that seat.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be the only female winner; so I pray a woman wins this year\u2019s Big Brother Naija.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion of the ongoing BBN Season 6?\n\nI think the season 6 housemates are unique in their own ways, but of course some people stand out more than others. So far, Maria, Whitemoney, Liquorose, Angel and Cross are giving me the vibes. As a BBN fanatic, if I have the power, these will be my top 5, and I will be so happy if any of them ace the game.\n\nDo you see yourself in any of the housemates?\n\nI see myself in Maria, Angel and Whitemoney; selfless, loving and outspoken.\n\nWho has the biggest chance of winning?\n\nThey all stand a chance of winning and may the best man win.\n\nTell us about your recently launched foundation?\n\nYes, I just recently launched my foundation; which has been, one of the things I wanted to do a long time ago. The Mercy Eke Foundation is about giving back to the society; giving back to the people that have nothing, giving back to the people who need it the most, and giving back to the people who made me what I am today. Helping small business owners, helping kids on the streets, single mothers, widows, students and more. So, yes, my foundation is just about giving back to the society.\n\nWhy did it take you this long to set it up?\n\nWell, it took me so long to start up my foundation because I wanted to get it right. I don\u2019t want to start a foundation because everyone has a foundation. I want to do it and I want to do it right, and also impact lives in the process. So, I had to take my time.\n\nHas it always been your dream to formally giveback to society or did this come as an afterthought?\n\nYes, it has been my dream to give back to the society. I\u2019m a giver. My heart is so big; I can\u2019t stand people suffering. I wish I could even do more. And it\u2019s been on my mind to help people; especially people that really need it. Our country is so bad right now that every day, I put this country in my prayers. I just want to see millions of struggling people in this country have at least, two square meals a day. So yes, I\u2019ve been giving, and giving back has always been my thing. I\u2019m glad I am able and I can do this at this point in my life.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen much of you in Nollywood as expected, aside Fate of Alakada, a few skits and in the forthcoming TV series \u2018TRIPS\u2019. What\u2019s happening?\n\nYes. You haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood as expected because coming out as a winner, I had a lot of things I had to do and I have been doing. Like now, I\u2019m currently shooting my reality show, setting up my business, foundation and working as an ambassador for brands I represent.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m doing more of movies. I recently finished shooting a movie, Shanty Town, which is yet to be out. And I did another one Trips, which is a TV series. There\u2019s also another script I\u2019m currently on; so, I\u2019m ready for Nollywood. I think this is the time. And remember, whenever you wake up, it\u2019s your morning. So right now, Nollywood, here comes your girl!\n\nDoes this have anything to do with your venturing into the real estate sector last year with the establishment of Lambo Homes?\n\nYes. I wasn\u2019t accepting the scripts then because I wanted to set up my businesses and also push other things. So, yeah, I think those were the reasons you all haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood.\n\nThe BBN Lockdown Season\u2019s reunion was staged recently; what do you think of the various housemates?\n\nI think all I see is growth and I love it. All of them are doing amazing. I\u2019m so proud of them.\n\nWho was your favourite and why?\n\nI think all of them. You know, they\u2019re all unique in their own ways.\n\nCan you recall your three best moments since 2019?\n\nI think the day I entered the BBN house, the day I came out of the house, and saw my parents from the stage and I was like \u201cMama, I made it\u201d, and also, the day I paid for my first home. These are my three best moments.\n\nYour fans were hopeful about your relationship with Ike Onyeka; what contributed to its crash?\n\nYou know, I was there and I have been there. Breakup happens and it is what it is. What crashed the relationship? I seriously don\u2019t know. I think we were not compatible; so it crashed.\n\nSo who\u2019s the man in your life right now and what do you love most about him?\n\nI can\u2019t mention his name. You know what they say about protecting people you love and cherish? That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I have a handsome, loving man by my side who supports and loves me. What I love about him is that, he is so consistent and intentional about me, and also, he\u2019s not about the social media life. He\u2019s a businessman and I love that he loves God. I just love him.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest regret?\n\nI don\u2019t think I regret anything because everything that has happened to me is either a blessing or a lesson; so, I don\u2019t regret anything.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI have quite a number of people and women who inspire me across the globe. A lot of people inspire me, especially people I can relate with; people I see myself in. People that have been through a lot.\n\nFrom which of your parents did you draw your resilient, goal-getting spirit from?\n\nIt is from my mother; she is a hardworking woman and has been there for my siblings and I despite how we troubled her. My mother inspires me the most; she\u2019s my biggest supporter and she\u2019s my everything.\n\nYou did a butt job; what advice do you have for young women who also want to have cosmetic surgery?\n\nWell, do what makes you happy. Do what you want to do; it\u2019s your body, you call the shot and it is your money \u2014 spend it how you like to. Do whatever makes you happy.\n\nDescribe your style in two words?\n\nMy style in two words will be glam and fun.\n\nWhat do you look forward to? I look forward to greatness, opportunities, more growth, and everything good because I deserve everything good. I also look forward to good health, more business opportunities, open doors and all the good things of life.",

          "text": "With the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of digital media such as podcasts has only continued to increase. Jumping on the train of making it a part of their life and most importantly, giving listeners an opportunity to learn from different life issues, celebrity radio presenter and actress, Moet Abebe, and multimedia journalist Nicole Abebe are poised to giving the audience visual elements of a Talk Show, as well as the possibility of enjoying a show on a podcast format with the launch of in producart format ; \u2018Spill the Tea With the Abebes.\u2019\n\nThe show seeks to \u2018address topics that affect young people, but often shy away from. For the Abebes, talking about these topics such as rape, human trafficking, sexual assault, and gender violence amongsts others need to be discussed because talking about, them they believe is the beginning of making certain individual corrections and ultimately correcting the ills prevalent in our society today. They tell us more.\n\nMOET ABEBE: Being an only child helped shape me Between you and Nicole, whose idea was Spill the Tea and what inspired it?\n\nIt was a joint effort as well as that of the new Director and Producer, Sefinah Lamii. We all were casually having a \u201cgirl\u2019s night, in\u201d and we all realized how well Nicole and I work together, our chemistry and banter are effortless. So, it just came about naturally that we should work together.\n\nWho is your target audience and why?\n\nOur target audiences are millennials both here in Africa and in the Diaspora. That is, men and mostly, women between the age of 25 and 45.\n\nWhat should your viewers expect from your podcasts?\n\nThey should expect a show that entertains, enlightens, and educates. Viewers should be expecting to see different perspectives, opinions and views about these said topics. This would leave them no choice but to want to do their own bit, to change some of these backdated social narratives.\n\nAre you planning on bringing guests and what would you look out for in your guests?\n\nYes, we are planning on having guests on the show. The guests on the show have been handpicked specifically in relation to the topics. Every guest present on this season is able to add their own perspective ,by bringing in their personal experiences, and using them as examples. The viewer will easily be able to relate to these guests because they are all celebrities and social contributors who are doing very well in their various fields. The guests give out their own advice and also gain a thing or two from myself and Nicole\u2019s contributions and vice versa.\n\nTell us a bit about yourself, growing up years and events that shaped you into who you are today?\n\nI spent most of my developing years here in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. I did my nursery and primary education in Lagos, then secondary and University was in the UK. I feel the constant back and forth between these two countries really shaped me into becoming the open-minded and non judgmental person that I am today. I have always had to deal with the two cultures and to create a balance. As an only child, this has really helped to shape me into becoming an independent and hardworking woman.\n\nYou read Law but have been in the media for some time now; tell us what informed the switch?\n\nYes, I have. I honestly didn\u2019t want a monotonous life. I felt I could contribute more and what better way than delve into the media industry where my voice can be heard and creatively expressed.\n\nWhat do you find fascinating about being a radio personality?\n\nI love the fact that my voice and input can touch someone many miles away. The fact that people know the voice and can spot it anywhere is exciting. The fact that just being myself and speaking on my interests or things that affect me, equally affect the listener is such an exhilarating and powerful feeling. I absolutely love it.\n\nWhat or who inspires you in life and why?\n\nIn all honesty, I inspire myself. I am such a survivor and fighter. I keep pushing myself. I believe I can do more and guess what, I keep proving myself that I can achieve anything I put my mind to\n\nDo you intend to practice law in future?\n\nNo, I do not intend to practice.\n\nShare an example of when you established and accomplished a goal that was personally challenging. What helped you succeed?\n\nBeing the Executive Producer of this show has been the most challenging thing I have done. Having to do everything practically on my own, especially the funding of the show. From its inception to now, the accomplished product has not been an easy road. However, what I believe helped me succeed definitely has been God, and having the best production team to support me and bring my ideas to life.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI try to, at least, stay active as much as I can. I am also very particular about what I take into my body and at what time.\n\nHow do you balance your work and private life?\n\nI\u2019m able to balance the two, by not allowing factors from either, cross into the other. I just try my best not to mix the two. The parties present in my work life are not in my private life and vice versa.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u201cme\u201d time?\n\nThere are two things I love aside from being in front of the camera and a microphone. They are going to the spa and going to the beach. Those are the ways I really get to relax and spend \u201cme\u201d time.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nIt would have to be Seychelles.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nNothing is permanent, not even being alive. So just live your life to the fullest, and love with a pure and good heart.\n\nNICHOLE ABEBE: Our visual podcasts provide fresh and fun new content\n\nHow did you and Moet get together on this job, what is your relationship like?\n\nWhere do I begin with my big cousin Moet? In my first year of university, we had to gain some work experience in the media industry, and luckily for me, I was coming home to Nigeria for the summer. It is where I first met Moet, and I am glad I met her. Moet has become one of my favourite people in this world. She\u2019s beyond caring, as real as real can be, and I know hands down she\u2019s got my back. I love to annoy her at times (which you will see in the podcast) but it\u2019s really all love. I\u2019m super grateful to have her in my life. We always joke about working together one day, but now that it\u2019s a reality, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it with anyone else.\n\nOf what benefit do you think the podcast will be to your viewers?\n\nI believe our visual podcasts will provide viewers with fresh and fun new content. When Moet and I set out to create \u2018Spill The Tea\u2019, we wanted something people could get lost in. From the visually appealing set design, to the fun and colourful outfits we wear, down to the intriguing conversations we have. Every aspect of Spill The Tea With The Abebes was intentional. We only got better as the season went on.\n\nHow do you hope to come up with fresh interview ideas?\n\nThe fact that we wake up every morning, with breath in our lungs, and God\u2019s grace to be granted the gift of sight, we will always have new content. Things happen every day, not just to us, but to the viewers watching. As human beings, we have so much in common that we don\u2019t even realise. We all go through similar emotions and experiences at different stages in our lives. As long as our content is relatable, I don\u2019t think we have a problem there.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you?\n\nI was born in London before I moved back to Lagos when I was three months old. I attended Corona Primary School in Victoria Island up until primary three. At this point, my family moved back to London where I finished up my primary school education at Lady Banks Junior School. When I was 11 years old, I attended Burford School, a boarding school in Oxfordshire.\n\nI spent my formidable years there. I often say this is where I spent some of my best school years. I left Burford when I was 16 and attended The Chelsea Independent College in London for my A-Levels. I gained my undergrad degree from the University of Bedfordshire in Broadcast Journalism, before attending The New York Film Academy in New York City for my masters in Broadcasting. I have great memories when I think back to my school days, a lot of cringe memories too\u2026but I\u2019m trying to forget those.\n\nWhat informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nSo, growing up, I loved Hollywood for all the amazing movies they produced. I used to say to myself, \u201cwell I know I can\u2019t act, so how can I be a part of Hollywood without being in the movies?\u201d That was when my attention moved to Ryan Seacrest, the American television presenter, producer. I became obsessed with his job and how he did it so well. I looked into his education and that was when I started visualising a path for myself. I thought to myself that if I could gain the same skills he has, what would stop me from getting on E? I actually wrote my University application letter about him and got accepted to all my choices: So it worked. Here I am today. Thanks to Ryan.\n\nWho is your biggest role model?\n\nMy mother! She is the strongest, most helpful, caring, supportive, hard-working individual I have ever come across. I thank God every day that he made her my mother. I wouldn\u2019t be the young woman I am today if not for the discipline she instilled in me at a young age. She is the last person I ever want to disappoint. I\u2019m working so hard so that one day, my brothers and I can tell her to sit back and relax.\n\nWhat do you do to keep fit and stay healthy?\n\nI\u2019m striving every day to become a full-time member of a Fitness club but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve learned to reduce my portion sizes. My choice of exercise is swimming. I love the fact that it works your whole body, plus, I find being in a huge body of water extremely calming and relaxing.\n\nWhat puts you off in people?\n\nI hate bad attitudes for no reason. If someone else upsets you, don\u2019t put that negative energy on me, it\u2019s not my fault. So when you first meet someone, show them the good sides of you. My mum always used to tell me, \u201calways look your best and act your best, people never forget the first impression\u201d.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I like to catch up on my favourite TV shows. I\u2019ve also gotten into exploring TV shows from other countries. I also find time to self-care. I give myself a facial every Sunday night and that makes me feel great when I wake up on Monday morning.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nMy best holiday destination is anywhere that gives me a tropical vibe. On my bucket list, I\u2019d like to visit places like Thailand, Bali, Greece, more destinations in the Caribbean and of course, The Maldives \u2013 but I\u2019ll save that one for my honeymoon.\n\nWhat lessons would you say life has taught you over the years?\n\nOver the years, life has taught me to look out for number one. I used to be a people pleaser and would get really upset when people weren\u2019t giving me the same energy I give them. It was a rude awakening when I realised most people don\u2019t care how they make you feel.",

On our way coming back, getting to Dutch Island our engine stopped.\n\n\u201cWe called for a new engine, a new engine was sent to us and we received it at 1pm. Between 1:30 and 2pm a chopper was seen around that area, it came around the first time, went back, came back again the second time and left.\n\n\u201cThe third time it came around, it dropped a rope from the chopper and a personnel was seen coming down from the chopper into the boat and later went back up, next thing they opened fire and started shooting at us.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether there was any loss of life, he said: \u201cIt was just me and one other person that was affected.

This led to widespread fear, panic and confusion as residents as the news spread life wildfire.\n\nSome of them were seen parking their belongings and moving to safer areas to avoid being caught in a possible raging petroleum inferno. Vehicles of different sizes and makes parked on the street and its surroundings were also quickly moved away by its owners for the same reason.\n\nBut following calls placed by some of the anxious but enlightened residents to concerned authorities helps were immediately sent to the area from Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), LRU (Light Rescue Unit) Fire, Lagos State Fire Service, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), NNPC, Lagos State Transport Management and Administration (LASTMA) and Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC).\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, life has returned to some level normalcy as the NNPC maintenance team could be seen on the scene working very hard to stop the flow and to commence repairs. The leakage was eventually stopped after some hours of feverish work by the team. But the situation is still fluid as the air is still charged with the smell of discharged PMS.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), linked the leakage to petroleum vandals. \u201cA very large volume of PMS was gushing out of the NNPC pipeline,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther investigation revealed that the heavy flow of PMS was caused by suspected pipeline vandalism and bunkering in the early hours of yesterday.\n\nAsked if there was any loss of life, he said: \u201cPresently, there is no loss of life and property, serious sensitization, public education and awareness are ongoing in the entire community. This is to avoid any form of open flame and burning in order to avoid any form of explosion or any other secondary incident.\u201d\n\nOur correspondent who visited the scene reported seeing three fire trucks parked standby to tackle any fire outbreak.",

          "text": "By Adedayo Akinwale\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has frowned upon the federal government\u2019s growing clampdown on the media, as well as the lack of professionalism and neutrality on the part of the regulatory agency under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government.\n\nThe caucus said its position was predicated on the query issued Channels Television by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and the invitation of some presenters of the television outfit to the headquarters of the Commission on Thursday over some recent interviews conducted on the station\u2019s morning show, Sunrise Daily.\n\nThe leader of the caucus, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, in a statement issued Friday also berated the federal government over an unwarranted harassment of Channels Television and its staff.\n\nThe caucus noted that this development smacks of another toxic push against press freedom and the citizens\u2019 right to know, contrary to the provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Minority caucus frowns on the growing clampdown on the media as well as the lack of professionalism and neutrality on the part of the regulatory agency under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, we hold that rather than try to muffle the media, the broadcast regulator should have directed the television station to avail the federal government the opportunity to refute, with facts, the statements of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State during the Sunrise Daily programme, which it considered critical or misrepresentation of the government.\u201d\n\nThe caucus described the commandeering of Channels Television presenters to NBC\u2019s headquarters in Abuja, the query of television outfit, and the unrelenting intimidation of independent broadcast media outfits by the NBC as most inauspicious.\n\nIt said Section 14 (2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution is very clear that the security of lives and property is the primary purpose of government, adding that the same constitution also vests all the security agencies and legitimate instruments of coercion solely in the federal government.\n\nIt stated: \u201cTherefore, when criminal cartels freely prowl and plunder the citizens, with the federal government showing manifest failure to step up to discharge its constitutional obligations, why should any reasonable government try to muffle the media in their constitutional role in the collective effort to salvage the situation, including the carnage going on in Benue State?\n\n\u201cThe Minority caucus points the federal government to the call by the governor of Mr. President\u2019s home state, Hon. Bello Masari, on people of Katsina State to defend themselves, and wonders how such is different from the attempt by Governor Ortom to hold the federal government to account on the failure to check the killings in his state. Both confirm the total breakdown of security in the land.\u201d\n\nThe caucus insisted that when bloody bandits and terrorists find their ways into an elite military training institution like the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), it presupposes nothing else but a brutal violation of the country\u2019s sovereignty and an unedited collapse of government and security.\n\nIn that regard, the caucus noted that the federal government should take steps to reassure the people rather than trying to muffle information.\n\nAs representatives of the people, the Minority caucus reminded the NBC the need to stick to professionalism and patriotism in the discharge of its duties.\n\nThe caucus also called on the federal government to desist from engaging in activities that give the citizens the impression that it is always trying to cover up facts.\n\nIt added that the NBC should not promote the suppression of the truth and it should bear in mind that there cannot be any NBC without Nigeria.\n\nThe Caucus said it is also high time the NBC eschewed partisanship and also understands that regulation does not presuppose the suppression of truth, but the promotion of it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Laleye Dipo\n\nThe released Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School Pupils were received by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger state Friday afternoon during which the governor said the abductors of the children were \u201chaving sickness and madness in their heads\u201d.\n\nThe children who were abducted on May 30 this year were released on Thursday and traveled through the night to arrive Minna the state capital at about 1am on Friday.\n\nThey were first taken to the Primary Health Care Facility in Bosso local government area where they were attended to medically before being given new clothes and the female ones among them were given the Muslim head veil, Hijab.\n\nThey were brought to the Government House in three buses and taken to the conference Hall.\n\nOne of the pupils\u2019 condition was so critical that he was carried by a government official into the Conference Hall\n\nIt was observed that this pupil was again taken back to the hospital after the reception for medical attention.\n\nThough government vehemently denied giving ransom to the bandits before the kids were released, a cross section of the parents spoken to said \u201cwe gave them (bandits) money\u201d.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that an unspecified amount of money was released to the bandits in addition to five new Bajaj Motorcycles .\n\nThere was contradiction in the number of pupils released. While Governor Sani Bello claimed \u201ca total of 91 pupils were kidnapped, we received 90, we unfortunately lost one\u201d, the head teacher of the school Alhassan Abubakar said 93 pupils were released.\n\n\u201d There is sickness and madness in the heads of people who kidnapped these pupils. I cannot understand how you abduct a 3-year old and keep him for more than two months,\u201d Bello said.\n\nBello confirmed also that four of the released pupils \u201care not okay\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the abduction of the pupils had affected \u201d the morale and confidence of the children and their parents but we will work on that\u201d.\n\nThe governor said now that the pupils had been released government will \u201cgo after the kidnappers and bring them to justice\u201d.\n\nThe head teacher of the school Alhaji Alhassan Abubakar Garba in an interview said the school will not be shut as a result of the incident, adding that the school will however be reorganised.\n\n\u201cWe will change their uniform. The school will continue we will redesign it, we will change the uniform\u201d.\n\nThough Alhassan Abubakar refused to say how much was paid to the bandits he did not hesitate to confirm that money was given, adding that \u201cmany people contributed money which we gave as ransom but I can\u2019t tell you the exact amount.\n\n\u201d I am excited, many people assisted us, many people contributed money, Christians, Muslims, individuals, I thank all of you,\u201d he said.\n\nHajia Rabi Abubakar, who reunited with two of her children kidnapped, thanked God for reuniting with her children. She sair, \u201d We paid before we got our children back\u201d.\n\nAn elated Chairman of Rafi local government council Alhaji Ismaila Modibo speaking to newsmen said a community meeting will be held in Kagara, headquarters of the local government next week to strategize on how to improve the security of the entire local government.\n\nThe children and their teachers were treated to a sumptuous meal before being ferried back to Tegina by the government.\n\nHowever, the parents who came to Minna to receive their wards were not allowed to go with them as one government official said, \u201cYou will get your children when we get to Tegina\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the People\u2019s Democractic Party has hailed the government for facilitating the release of the children but said \u201cWe will never again let Governor Sani Bello\u2019s sleeping and snoring administration go back to sleep\u201d.\n\nThe party in a statement by it\u2019s Publicity Secretary Alhaji Sulaiman Ahmed Aliyu said \u201d We ( PDP) received the heart cheering news of the release of Tegina Islammiyya pupils who were abducted 86 days ago\u201d, adding that it was only when the PDP speaks out that the APC led administration wakes up from slumber.\n\n\u201d The PDP will continue to speak, act and defend the masses of Niger state, including the vulnerable APC members,\u201d Aliyu said in the statement, pointing out that, \u201cThe PDP will continue to give leadership, guidance, strategic direction and crash course to the APC led administration in Niger state at least until it expires in 21 Months to come.\u201d\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Alex Enumah\n\nTwelve associates of Yoruba Nation agitator, Mr Sunday Adeyemo otherwise known as Sunday Igboho, has threatened to file a suit for the committal to prison of the Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS) over his refusal to release them days after a Federal High Court signed the warrant for their release on bail.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court, Abuja had recently issued a warrant for the release of the detainees after they had perfected the bail granted them by his court.\n\nHowever, it has been alleged that the Director General of the DSS, Mr Yusuf Bichi, have been blocking lawyers from giving effect to the release of warrants since Monday when they were served on him.\n\nApparently angered by the development, the lawyer to the 12 detained associates, Mr Pelumi Olajengbesi, on Friday, threatened to commence contempt proceedings against Bichi for the agency\u2019s alleged failure to comply with an order of court for the release of his clients.\n\nOlajengbesi told journalists that his clients had, last week, met the conditions attached to the bail granted them by Justice Egwuatu following which the judge signed their release warrant on Monday.\n\nHe said despite being served with the release warrant, the DSS has failed to release the detainees, who were arrested during the July 1 raid on Igboho\u2019s Ibadan home by a combined team of men of the DSS and the Nigerian military, and have been detained since then.\n\nThe lawyer said: \u201cThe refusal of the SSS to honour a clear order of court, though habitual, is not only worrisome and unacceptable, but is an affront on the authority of the court and our entire judicial system.\n\n\u201cSuch blatant disregard for, and contemptuous, spiteful and insolent disrespect of an order of court if allowed to fester would undermine the very integrity of the court and breed even newer levels of rascality by state agents.\n\n\u201cIt would also amount to surrendering the freedom and rights of all 12 detainees to the whims and caprices of an agency that has gone rogue and thrives in wilful disobedience of court orders.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we are giving the SSS, particularly its Director-General, 48 hours and not an hour more, within which to fully obey and comply with the release order of the court in favour of all 12 detained associates of Mr. Sunday Igboho or face contempt proceedings before a court of competent jurisdiction with the full weight and recompense of the court brought to bear against his insolence and disregard of court order.\n\n\u201cTake notice that we will not fail to exhaust all legal and social remedy available to the detainees in enforcing their rights in this matter and setting the tone against the SSS\u2019 notorious disregard of due process and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

What was the intention? Simple. An attack on the soft underbelly of the forces of good. It was deliberate, contrived, orchestrated, all to make government look bad, and pump discouragement into the military at a time they were poised to make a decisive end of the security challenges,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cStrike at their jugular, and get the motley crowd wailing. The emergency analysts will come with false narratives, the opposition political parties and interest groups with negative mindsets will trumpet it, and make it seem as if the Heavens were falling. What a country! What a people! They value nothing, appreciate nothing. Except for those who understand.\n\n\u201cAs President Buhari has said, the NDA attack was meant to throw a dampener into the morale of our military. And the negative chorus, always on standby, is reinforcing the intention. But some people know better, and they will not be discouraged. Let those playing negative politics with security and human lives continue. The days of evildoers are numbered in this country. God is always on the side of good people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEmperor Haile Selassie said it, and it was rendered into music by Bob Marley: \u2018for we have confidence in the victory of good over evil.\u2019 We will not rejoice at iniquity, at evil. We will not pump discouragement into our troops, nor into a government working hard to improve our fortunes, despite the strong winds of adversity. We believe the word of God: \u2018The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressors for the upright. (Proverbs 21:18).\u2019\n\nHe added that goodwill always overcome evil, and the seeming victory of \u201cthose who celebrate evil\u201d can only be temporary.",

What was the intention? Simple. An attack on the soft underbelly of the forces of good. It was deliberate, contrived, orchestrated, all to make government look bad, and pump discouragement into the military at a time they were poised to make a decisive end of the security challenges,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cStrike at their jugular, and get the motley crowd wailing. The emergency analysts will come with false narratives, the opposition political parties and interest groups with negative mindsets will trumpet it, and make it seem as if the Heavens were falling. What a country! What a people! They value nothing, appreciate nothing. Except for those who understand.\n\n\u201cAs President Buhari has said, the NDA attack was meant to throw a dampener into the morale of our military. And the negative chorus, always on standby, is reinforcing the intention. But some people know better, and they will not be discouraged. Let those playing negative politics with security and human lives continue. The days of evildoers are numbered in this country. God is always on the side of good people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEmperor Haile Selassie said it, and it was rendered into music by Bob Marley: \u2018for we have confidence in the victory of good over evil.\u2019 We will not rejoice at iniquity, at evil. We will not pump discouragement into our troops, nor into a government working hard to improve our fortunes, despite the strong winds of adversity. We believe the word of God: \u2018The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressors for the upright. (Proverbs 21:18).\u2019\n\nHe added that goodwill always overcome evil, and the seeming victory of \u201cthose who celebrate evil\u201d can only be temporary.",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there.

Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2021, YouTube announced that it would start paying YouTube Shorts creators $10,000 monthly as a reward for creating exciting and engaging content. But they need to meet some requirements to be eligible for the Shorts Fund.\n\nIf Shorts is available in your country, then you\u2019ve passed the first eligibility test. So, what next? Well, your Shorts need to have high engagements. Depending on the number of views, creators can earn between $100 and $10,000.\n\nFurthermore, the videos need to be original; you cannot make a video on TikTok and post it on YouTube.\n\nOkay, now that we have those out of the way, here are six ways to make your Shorts more exciting and original:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Spice up your videos with music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nWhat\u2019s that saying about music being food for the soul again? Without background music, your Shorts might be boring. YouTube Shorts lets you add music to your content by tapping the Add Music icon at the centre of the top bar. It will take you to a music library that allows you to select one of the preset songs or songs by famous artistes. Interestingly, you can add audio from other YouTube videos to your Shorts. A list of most commonly used Shorts songs is available, meaning you\u2019re spoilt for choice.\n\nWhether your content is dull or cheerful, music is a great way to spice up your Shorts life.\n\n2. Add texts to your videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle tweaks can make enormous differences. Okay, proverbial sayings out of the way. One way to emphasise your points, spice up your videos, or pass your ideas across better is by adding texts to your Shorts content. You can add different text styles and modify them with varying colours, alignments, and widths, among other options.\n\n3. Import videos from your phone\u2019s gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho says you have to do a live recording? If there\u2019s a pre-recorded video you believe will be perfect for your Shorts, you can import it from your gallery. All you need to do is click on the gallery button at the bottom left corner of the record screen, select the video, edit with music or text, and then upload.\n\n4. Adjust video speed to suit your idea better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nWho doesn\u2019t like some slo-mo or break-neck speed effect? Of course, what you use depends on what you\u2019re trying to achieve. YouTube Shorts lets you experiment with recording speed. With five possible speed options, you can generate slow-mo or speed-up effects by using the \u201cSpeed\u201d button.\n\n5. String multiple video clips together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know the saying \u201cthe more, the merrier\u201d? It\u2019s not just for owambe food and drinks; it can apply to your Shorts content too. The multi-segment camera on YouTube Shorts allows you to string multiple video clips together, eliminating the need for an external editor. All you need to do is release the record button while shooting to pause the video and resume recording when you push the button again.\n\n6. Make your video eye-catching with video filters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nFirst impressions matter in job interviews as much as they do in content creation. The way your content is presented matters as much, or dare I say, even more than your content. To make your videos more visually appealing, you can switch to varying filters in the recording and editing screens within the Shorts Camera. The filters also change the outlook of a video by colour-correcting footage and enhancing the look and feel.\n\nPeople often talk about the similarity between YouTube Shorts and video platforms like TikTok. But there\u2019s money to be made here, so let\u2019s stop the scrutiny for a moment and help creators build their content businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, YouTube Shorts launched in September 2020, allowing users to make catchy 60-second videos on their mobile phones. In May 2021, YouTube announced via a blog post that a $100 million Short Funds would be distributed to Shorts content creators whose videos receive massive engagements between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

It also does not imply that the dyscalculic is dumb or not trying hard enough to succeed in maths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat then is dyscalculia? It\u2019s a learning disability \u2014 not as widespread as dyslexia \u2014 that affects the part of the brain responsible for maths and related tasks.\n\nThis is a good time to revisit this article on dyslexia: 4 Tech Tools To Help People With Dyslexia Overcome Workplace And School Challenges.\n\nHow will you know if someone has dyscalculia? A dyscalculic may struggle to read the analogue clock, count numbers, remember that 2+2=4, and understand maths-related expressions such as \u201cgreater than.\u201d\n\nRather than repeating the same instructions, dyscalculics, like dyslexics, require different interventions such as assistive tech tools.\n\nI looked at five tech tools that can assist dyscalculics in overcoming their challenges. Dive in: 5 tech tools that can help people struggling with maths and math concepts overcome their challenges\n\nYouTube Shorts launches YouTube Shorts Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? YouTube Shorts has launched the YouTube Shorts Fund to help Shorts creators earn money and grow their businesses.\n\nWhat does this mean? The YouTube Shorts Fund will be distributed as a monthly bonus payment to thousands of eligible YouTube Shorts creators between 2021 and 2022 as a reward for delivering innovative and engaging content on the platform the previous month.\n\nWhat about YouTube Shorts? Launched in September 2020, YouTube Shorts allows users to make catchy 60-second videos on their mobile phones using creation tools like a multi-segment camera to string multiple video clips together, record with music, and control speed settings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, creators can win up to $10,000 based on how many people watch and interact with their Shorts content.\n\nWant a share? Channels must meet the basic eligibility requirements, updated monthly to allow other producers to get recognition for their innovative and distinctive Shorts.\n\nGlobally, Shorts creators have already attracted millions of subscribers through their Shorts-only channels. Also, Nigerians are becoming increasingly interested in YouTube Shorts.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big picture? YouTube claims that the Shorts Fund is the first step towards developing a revenue model for YouTube Shorts.\n\npawaPay\u2019s seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica-focused payments company, pawaPay, has raised $9 million in seed funding to scale its operations, hire talent, and expand into new markets.\n\nThe round was led by UK-based seed fund and accelerator, 88mph, and MSA Capital, a Chinese VC firm. Zagadat Capital, Kepple Ventures, and Vunani Capital participated in the round.\n\npawaPay was founded in 2020 by Nikolai Barnwell. The business is a spin-off of betPawa, an online sports betting company, to assist customers in sending and receiving money globally via mobile money.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the company claims to handle more than ten million transactions weekly, with beta operations in ten African countries, including Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, and Nigeria.\n\nIncredibly, despite these high transaction volumes, Barnwell says that pawaPay could have done even more if not for regulatory constraints and licensing procedures in each market.\n\nMore plans? pawaPay wants to position itself as a market leader in high-volume mobile money payments while delivering reliability and transparency for merchants.\n\nCheck here for more context.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nTizeti Is Testing A Next-gen Technology That Could Bring 5G-level Speeds To Nigeria\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nNetflix starts testing in-app games for users in Poland.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are in Nigeria and have a smartphone close by, let\u2019s do a little test. Spoiler Alert, we\u2019re borrowing a leaf from Tizeti\u2019s playbook, so try to keep up.\n\nGo to Speedtest.net on your browser and let it load for a few seconds.\n\nWhat speed do you see? 500 kbps? We\u2019re sorry about that. 2 Mbps? Well, pretty much standard. 50 Mbps? You\u2019re simply the boss. 100 Mbps? Speak the truth; you are not in Nigeria.\n\nWhatever your results, they\u2019ll probably pale in comparison to what Tizeti has in store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf recent updates are anything to go by, the telecom startup is currently testing next-generation WiFi technology in Nigeria that, if successful, could deliver Internet speeds up to 1Gbps \u2014 over 30x Nigeria\u2019s average Internet speed.\n\nThis means if you subscribe to 1 Gb of data, you will use it up in just one second.\n\nTizeti CEO, Kendall Ananyi, and Ikenna Uche (CTO) revealed this at Tizeti\u2019s NextGen event, held on Wednesday, August 11, 2021. The event featured experts from startups like Kudi, Aella Credit, and industry heavyweights like Nokia and MainOne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTizeti CEO, Kendall Ananyi\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has apparently given Tizeti the green light to test the new technology which will be available to its customers all over the country.\n\nWhat is this new technology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort answer, WiGig or 60 GHz WiFi. Ananyi explains that the new speeds will be built on the WiGig infrastructure known as 60 GHz Wi-Fi, next-generation technology on par with 5G technology.\n\nCurrently, most WiFi devices (routers and transmitters) in homes or offices run on 2.4 GHz with the fastest reaching up to 7 GHz.\n\nNaturally, a lot of Internet service providers transmit on these lower frequencies across the globe, so it is more congested. The WiGig allows WiFi devices (routers) to access the 60GHz frequency, which is way less congested and can help transmit data at multi-gigabit per second speeds.\n\nBasic technical details\n\nThe WiGig frequency falls within the millimetre-wave (mmWave) spectrum that features frequencies between 30 GHz and 300 GHz. It is sandwiched between microwave frequencies (300 Mhz and 30 GHz) and infrared frequencies (300 GHz to 400 THz).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mmWave is not without flaws, as its signals can easily be disrupted by rain, humidity, and other environmental factors. Consequently, mmWave signals can only extend for a few kilometres.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about real-world use cases. The mmWave is used for radio astronomy, remote sensing, automotive radars, military applications, imaging, and security screening.\n\nThis frequency allows for silky smooth, high-resolution video streaming/broadcast, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many others for everyday use. By now, you may have guessed that the high-end 5G network is based on this technology.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the name?\n\nWiGig stands for Wireless Gigabit Alliance, an industry trade group founded in 2007 by Ali Sadri, a Senior Director for mmWave Advanced Technology Development & Standards at Intel. He later recruited people from top global companies like Apple, Huawei, Microsoft, Sony, Dell, Qualcomm, and Toshiba, among others, to the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nTheir idea was to create interconnected home entertainment and office devices like PCs, tablets, smartphones, TVs, and music systems, without using wires.\n\nAt the time, the WiGig was not certified, but it worked with the Wi-Fi Alliance \u2014 the body that owns the Wi-Fi trademark \u2014 to develop the technology to mitigate its weaknesses. The collaboration helped extend the WiGig range to cover entire homes but at slower speeds.\n\nIn 2013, the WiGig Alliance merged with the Wi-Fi Alliance, but the 60 GHz Wi-Fi retained the name WiGig.\n\nTizeti\u2019s CTO, Uche, says the company is bringing the speeds and benefits of 5G technology before it arrives in Nigeria.\n\nWhy is this relevant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTizeti CTO, Ikenna Uche describing Tizeti\u2019s technology process before the pandemic\n\nThe increase in Nigeria\u2019s Internet speed needs to be commensurate with its digital economy expansion and growing demand for Internet services.\n\nPer Internet World\u2019s Stats\u2019 December 2020 report, Nigeria has a 73% Internet penetration rate with up to 154 million Internet subscriptions.\n\nInternet World\u2019s Stats expresses the number of Internet subscriptions as a percentage of the country\u2019s population. Since a person might have more than one Internet device, this does not necessarily present an accurate number of unique Internet users in the country.\n\nNonetheless, Uche corroborates a popular assertion that Internet users in Nigeria increased during the lockdown.\n\nHe maintains that before the lockdown, Tizeti was only able to offer 2 to 5 Mbps to its customers, but the pandemic\u2019s onset forced it to improve its overall infrastructure, which more than doubled its Internet speed, taking it as high as 10 to 20 Mbps.\n\nLast year, the company said it had delivered 100 terabytes worth of data in six years, but it has added up to 80 terabytes in just one year.\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria leave much to be desired, and even more so with an ever-increasing demand.\n\nAccording to Speedtest\u2019s Global Index, Nigeria\u2019s average Internet speed stands at 23.61 Mbps, making it 96th worldwide and 8th in Africa.\n\nHow soon could this be available?\n\nAnanyi reveals that the technology should be commercially available to Nigerians by November 2021 after the ongoing tests and demos.\n\nThis means Nigerians in Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, and Edo States \u2014 where Tizeti has a major presence \u2014 would be able to access it once it goes live. The company will also be expanding to Abuja, Ibadan, Kaduna, Kano, Warri/Asaba, Eket/Uyo, Onitsha, Aba, Enugu, and Calabar.\n\nWho can access it?\n\nAnanyi says that as of August 2021, Tizeti has up to two million users across Nigeria and Ghana, all of whom will have access to the new technology.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nAt the time of writing this, Tizeti had not revealed how much the WiGig would cost. You can check their current pricing here and scale things up to manage your expectations.\n\nAnanyi insists that prices will remain affordable, in keeping with the company\u2019s vision of providing fast, affordable, and reliable unlimited Internet.\n\nWhat else has Tizeti been up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkin Jones, CEO of Aella, Eniola Campbell, Country Head, Nigeria, Nokia, Olubunmi Ogun, Deputy General Manager, MainOne, and Kendall Ananyi, CEO, Tizeti.\n\nSince launching in 2014 as Wifi.com.ng, Tizeti has witnessed steady growth by adopting a unique approach to its operations. While issues like epileptic power have plagued telecom operators, Tizeti uses solar energy to power most of its towers.\n\nIn 2017, the company got into US-based accelerator Y Combinator and raised a $2.1 million seed round soon after. Then followed the launch of Express Wi-Fi by Facebook, an Internet service targetting Nigeria\u2019s low-income earners.\n\nIn 2018, it raised a $3 million Series A to expand to other countries. With a presence in four Nigerian states and Accra, Ghana, Tizeti says it has over 10,000 voice lines and two million Internet users.\n\nIt has also struck a partnership with financial services provider, Kudi, with thousands of agents across the country enabling people to pay for Tizeti packages in cash. There is also Aella Credit, a digital lending platform where people can buy data now and pay later.\n\nWhile the NCC\u2019s 5G auction seems to be some months away, Tizeti\u2019s next-gen technology might just open the floodgates for more innovators in Nigeria\u2019s Internet space. And that can only be a good thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst. There's always something new to know.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that the state government will continue to make investment in preserving the health, safety and environment of Edo people as the state marks its 30th anniversary.\n\nObaseki said this during the flag-off a tree-planting campaign held at Idu village in Orhionmwon Local Government Forest Reserve, as part of activities to mark the 30th anniversary of Edo State. The tree-planting campaign is in line with the government\u2019s reforestation initiative of planting ten million trees in the next ten years.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs we celebrate 30 years of the existence of Edo as a State, we must realize that we live in a world that is being ravaged by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We have lost loved ones: friends and family. Even as we celebrate our glorious nation and our proud heritage, circumstances demand that we must summon all effort, as a people, to ensure that we protect ourselves against the deadly scourge.\n\n\u201cConsidering the nature of this unusual enemy, we must quickly adopt a sustainable approach to effectively deal with this scourge along with the disruptions associated with it. That is why to defeat the virus, vaccination is a necessity.\n\n\u201cThose countries and communities with high rates of vaccination are recording fewer hospitalizations and lifting all restrictions. We have to be at the forefront of ensuring that we all get inoculated against COVID-19 so that we can build herd immunity and more lives will not be lost needlessly.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAs we protect ourselves from the pandemic, we must also take cognizance of our environment. Environmental sustainability is key to our cultural and economic preservation. The rich forest reserves that our ancestors passed to us have been seriously degraded and depleted, leading to adverse weather conditions that threaten our existence as a people.\n\n\u201cEdo has always been known as the centre of the rainforest belt in Nigeria and West Africa and we have a responsibility to regenerate our forests. It is for this reason that we, collaborating with private stakeholders, have embarked on a reforestation program to have ten million trees planted in Edo State, over the next decade. We must balance environmental sustainability with livelihoods and strategically reclaim our expansive forest lands for present and future generations.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate Edo at 30 today, our emphasis and focus must be on environmental sustainability. In the post-fossil fuel era, we must strive to redevelop our natural resources in forestry and its value chain. That is why I will be planting trees as a significant step in leading our forestry regeneration goal of ten million trees in the next ten years.\n\n\u201cAlong with our forest regeneration drive, we also want to keep our forests and our land safe. With your support and collaboration of security agencies in the state, we will be re-establishing a forestry protection force to ensure that bandits cannot use our forest as basis to foster criminality,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to the security of lives and property of Edo citizens, Obaseki stated: \u201cWe are determined to improve on the feat recorded so far in terms of security in the state and ensure that kidnapping, armed robbery, land grabbing and other criminal activities are reduced to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOur security strategy is hinged on collaboration between the national security structure and the Edo State Community Vigilante Security Network so that community participation is a key driver in our security plan.\u201d\n\nHe further added: \u201cOur mission to Make Edo Great Again (MEGA) will only be a pipe dream without rethinking the methods that got us to this point and recalibrating existing systems to address our peculiar challenges, in the quest to compete and dominate in a fast-changing world. To achieve our mission of MEGA comprehensively, we must involve our kit and kin in Delta State.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore commencing discussions to establish a Bendel Commission to foster mutual cooperation and collaboration in economic, security, cultural and environmental matters between Edo and Delta States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI invite all Edo people to join in celebrating this 30-year milestone, as we have all shown resilience, courage, strength and determination in building a strong and virile state, even as we look forward to the next 30 years of growth and shared prosperity,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nSharing a brief history of the origin of the Edo people, Obaseki said \u201cthe Edo Nation has always been renowned as pacesetters: The old Midwestern Region, from where Bendel State was formed, was the first state in Nigeria to be created by a referendum, signaling how strongly we have always sought self-actualization, self-preservation and embraced democratic ideals.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we come from forebears who displayed exceptional sophistication in Arts, organization and development. This enthralled the Europeans when their ships berthed on our shores as far back as the fifteenth century. By this time, we had built an architectural marvel with the largest earthwork in human history, with city walls four times the length of the renowned Great Walls of China; traces of which are evident today in what is popularly known as the Benin Moat.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe world was awed by the splendour of Benin City, which by the 15th century had palm-oil-lit street lights which illuminated its very broad streets, some over a hundred feet wide, with underground channels to drain stormwater and check flooding.\n\nThis is not to mention our elaborate governance and judicial systems, with courts and enforceable penal laws.\n\n\u201cWith this deep history and heritage, we have survived the ages and our people have continued making indelible marks globally. The spirit and blood of our ancestors run deep in us. This strong sense of identity has led us to rise above our challenges in our quest for sustainable development, growth and progress; today, we celebrate yet another milestone.\n\n\u201cThroughout our history, the key driver of our prowess has been our human capacity. It cannot be different today. That is why we are emphasizing education as the fulcrum for our development. The Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme is globally recognised as one of the most significant Education reforms programme in Africa today.\n\n\u201cWe are repositioning our civil and public service to provide world-class service to Edo people at home and abroad. We have continued to invest in our youth through various programs spearheaded by the Edo Skills Development Agency (EdoJobs), which has given birth to numerous enterprises in the Edo Production Centres, Edo Tech Hub and Edo Creative Hub.\n\n\u201cThe next few decades will witness Edo State becoming the Technology Hub in Nigeria as we create more partnerships to train and develop thousands of young people into competent software developers and Tech solutions providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough some of the challenges that beset us today may differ from those of our forebears, but like them, our ability to make deliberate, concerted and sustained efforts to overcome adversity is very much assured. In the face of difficulty, we will remain bold, decisive and united, as these values have always guaranteed our survival, advancement and triumph,\u201d he noted.\n\n...",

This necessitates the need for everyone to get vaccinated in order to be protected against the virus.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, charge everyone to present themselves at the nearest vaccination centre within their communities to get vaccinated, as it is the safest way to defeat this common enemy of mankind.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to vaccinate more Edo people in order to achieve herd immunity against the virus, the Incident Manager said the state is having continuous engagements with relevant stakeholders to increase vaccination uptake in the state.\n\nObi further stated that Edo has so far collected 7,392 samples and recorded 340 confirmed cases, with 110 recoveries since July 17, 2021, when the state started tracking the third wave of the virus.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in Abuja, on Friday, gave the Nigerian police an ultimatum to either charge Glory Okorie, an alleged spy for the Eastern Security Network (ESN), to court or release her.\n\nMiss Okorie was arrested by the operatives of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), a tactical unit of the police, on June 17, 2021 in Imo State and subsequently transferred to Abuja.\n\nDetained without charge since her arrest, the suspect has now been in illegal custody for 71 days as of Friday.\n\nIn his ruling on an ex parte application filed by the detainees\u2019 lawyers, the judge, Sylvester Okorie, on Friday, ordered the respondents \u2013 police authorities \u2013 to charge her to court on or before August 31, 2021, should their be any case against her.\n\nIn the alternative to the order directing the police to charge the suspect, the court ordered the respondents to release Miss Okorie on bail in the sum of N2million with a surety.\n\nMr Oriji said the surety must be a civil servant not less than Grade Level 12 in the federal civil service.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby ordered as follows that, the respondents shall charge the application to court on or before 31 August, 2021, if they have any case against her.\n\n\u201cIf the applicant is not charged to court as aforesaid, the respondents are ordered to release her on bail upon fulfilment of the following conditions.\n\n\u201cThe applicants shall enter a bail bond in the sum of N2,000,000 with one surety in like sum, to report to the respondents whenever they are ready to charge her to court,\u201d the court held.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s lawyer, Ihensekhein Samuel, had filed the application on August 24, specifically, suing the Inspector General of Police, Tunde Disu, a deputy commissioner of police heading the IRT, and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), as the respondents.\n\nHe had urged the court to order the release of Miss Okorie on bail from unlawful incarceration by the police for over two months.\n\nPublic outcry over Okolie\u2019s detention\n\nLast Tuesday, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) demanded the release of Miss Okorie\u2019s release from illegal police detention which had lasted about 71 days as of Friday.\n\nReacting to the development in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of the NHRC, Tony Ojukwu, said the only alternative open to the police was to charge her to court.\n\nMr Ojukwu, who was quoted in a statement released by the commission on Tuesday, described the detention as \u201ca gross violation of human rights,\u201d adding that it must be accounted for to serve as a deterrent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commission is therefore using this medium to demand the immediate and unconstitutional release of the detainee or in alternative charge her to a court of competent jurisdiction so that she will enjoy the right to fair hearing and the opportunity to defend the allegations against her, if any,\u201d Mr Ojukwu had said.\n\nESN, believed to be the military arm of the outlawed separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been blamed for various violent activities in the South-east and South-south regions.\n\nSimilarly, Amnesty International, which had called for her release on Monday, said she was apprehended by the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), a tactical unit of the Nigerian police, headed by Tunde Disu in Imo State on June 17, 2021.\n\nThe international human rights watchdog said she was later moved to Abuja where she has been denied access to her family members and lawyer in violation of her rights.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Ojukwu noted that the \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d of the police cannot be tolerated in the 21st Century, adding that \u201cperpetrators of such heinous crime must be immediately brought to justice.\u201d\n\nExpressing sadness over the claims of her being used as slave by police officers, Mr Ojukwu noted that the detainee was \u201cwashing clothes, sent in errands to buy stuffs for officers, tortured by some of the officers in charge of her detention hence the need for her release without further delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to condemn such unprofessional conduct which undoubtedly resulted in further violation of the rights of the lady in question because her rights to freedom of movement and liberty among several others had been allegedly violated with impunity by the very personnel charged with the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of citizens,\u201d the NHRC boss was quoted in the statement.\n\nPolice allegations\n\nThe police had announced the arrest of 21-year-old Ms Okolie, accusing her of being complicit in \u201cthe series of deliberate and well-coordinated attacks\u201d on security formations and other critical national infrastructures in the South-east and South-south regions.\n\nThe deputy public relations officer of the police, Aremu Adeniran, said Ms Okolie was arrested in Imo State, adding that she had aided the police in the arrest of one of the ESN\u2019s top leader they identified as Onye Army.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported that Ms Okolie\u2019s arrest comes amidst reduced attacks by gunmen believed to be ESN members in the South-east and South-south regions of Nigeria.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), has said the decision of Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodinma to back out of the decision of Southern Governors to implement anti-open grazing laws in their states, is \u201can unfortunate betrayal of the Igbo race.\u201d\n\nRecall that Senator Uzodinma had after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, backtracked from the resolution of Southern governors to ban upon grazing in the region, with deadline for legislation set for September 1, opting instead for what he called understating between farmers and herders in the state.\n\nReacting to the governor\u2019s decision in a statement by Abia Onyike, Chairman of its Media and Publicity Bureau, the ADF noted that the action Uzodinma has taken, \u201che has unwittingly renounced his membership of the Igbo race, an act which, within the context of Igbo Culture and tradition is a sacrilege. If indeed ha has done so, nothing short of spiritual cleansing can abate the wrath of Igbo Ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe ADF called on the governor to immediately reverse the decision and ban open grazing in line with the resolution of Southern governors.\n\n\u201cWe therefore advise him to quickly go for spiritual cleansing before he can be seen as a normal member of the Igbo race,\u201d ADF further noted.\n\n\u201cThe anti-open grazing law is the most focal law in Igbo land today. It is needed and intended to protect the Igbo race and safeguard her ancestral lands. So, for any Igbo Governor or person for that matter to renounce the anti-open grazing law is a pointer that he subscribes to the wiping out of the Igbo race from existence.\n\n\u201cOne of his lawyers has publicly acknowledged that there was an anti- open grazing law in Imo State, passed by the State House of Assembly during the tenure of former Governor Achike Udenwa, one of the predecessors of Gov. Hope Uzodinma.Thus what Gov. Uzodinma has done is to renounce an existing law made in the interest of the people. This is an impeachable offence.\n\n\u201cWhether the present Imo state Legislature takes action to preserve the Constitutional order order in Imo State or not, Imo state cannot claim to have a legitimate Executive Governor in the present circumstances.\n\n\u201cMay the Almighty God protect and preserve the people of Imo state and return a Constitutional order to their besieged state.\u201d",

          "title": "Again, Bandits Kill 14 In Kaduna, Katsina, Abduct 6",
          "text": "Bandits again attacked Dan-Kumel community in Kankara local government council of Katsina State, killing about 11 villagers.\n\nA resident of the village, Abdulmumini Sani, said they invaded the village Thursday night with sporadic gunshots as residents ran for safety but some were shot dead while many sustained were wounded.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the attack this morning (Friday), we counted 11 dead bodies and we are currently making arrangements for their burial. Those wounded are receiving treatment in a medical facility,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state police spokesman, SP Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident, saying seven persons were killed in the attack.\n\nIn a related development, the Kaduna State government yesterday disclosed that gunmen attacked Machun and Manuka villages in Zangon Kataf local government area, leaving three residents dead and several others injured.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA statement issued by the commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said according to the security reports, police personnel responded to a distress call from Machun village and mobilized there.\n\nAruwan said on arrival, they were also alerted by gunshots from neighbouring Manuka.\n\n\u201cAs the assailants fled the area, the operatives found the corpses of three victims identified as follows: Jennifer Raymond, Dawali Saleh and Livinus Adamu.\n\nSome people were wounded and are receiving treatment in hospital, Aruwan said.\n\nThe statement said Governor Nasir el-Rufai received the report with sadness, and prayed for the repose of those killed, while sending condolences to their families.\n\nThe governor wished those wounded a quick recovery.\n\nHe urged security agencies working in the area to ensure thorough investigations and intensify efforts at apprehending the perpetrators of the attacks:\n\nBandits Storm Zaria Again, Kidnap 6\n\nGunmen early yesterday stormed Zangon Shanu village, near the main campus of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State and kidnapped six people.\n\nZangon Shanu is a settlement mostly occupied by ABU lecturers and staff of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria.\n\nSpeaking to LEADERSHIP WEEKEND, a resident, Mallam Musa Garbai said; \u201cThe bandits stormed the area between 1 and 1.30am on Friday and kidnapped 6 people and fled with them to an unknown destination.\u201d\n\nHe said the bandits shot into the air to scare residents after which they went away with their victims.\n\nOur correspondent reports that the attack on the village came barely a month after bandits attacked the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Training Centre and Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria and abducted scores of people.\n\nLEADERSHIP WEEKEND observed that security measures have been beefed up by authorities of NCAT, Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT) and Ahmadu Bello University all in Zaria.\n\nEfforts to contact the police spokesman, ASP Muhammed Jalige for comment on the incident were not successful as his mobile telephone number was not going through.\n\nInsecurity: It\u2019s Time For Buhari To Talk Nigerians Directly \u2013 Ndume\n\nThe senator representing Borno South and chairman Senate Committee on Army, Mohammed Ali Ndume, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address to Nigerians directly against the backdrop of insecurity in the country instead of speaking through his media aides.\n\nSenator Ndume made the call on Thursday, while speaking with journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe lawmaker asked President Buhari to take a cue from United State President Joe Biden who makes it a daily duty to brief Americans on the fate of US citizens still trapped in Afghanistan.\n\nSenator Ndume said President Buhari also needs to visit ground zeros in order to get first-information about incidents and happenings.\n\n\u201cI am just being worried that the president is not talking to Nigerians. In a situation like this, silence is not golden.\n\n\u201cIf the US president could be addressing Americans every day on the issue in Afghanistan, I also expect President Muhammadu Buhari to be addressing Nigerians either daily, weekly or fortnightly on the security situations across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe president should create a situation room to brief Nigerians on the current situation and what his government is doing about it.\n\n\u201cSuch action would allay the fears of the people. It is not enough to provide the security agencies with everything they need to prosecute the war, the president should take charge.\n\n\u201cHe should also cultivate the habit of visiting places where incidents happen to physically assess the situation on the ground,\u201d Ndume said.\n\nAlso speaking on the Tuesday attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna State by bandits, Ndume said the incident was unfortunate and confirmed how daring the bandits have become.\n\nHe, however, noted that the military has since become overwhelmed in the face of various security challenges across the country, adding that there would be consequences.\n\n\u201cAt the peak of the insurgency, the Boko Haram terrorists had the audacity in the past to take their fight to military formations and barracks and the soldiers had had cause to withdraw from those areas and up till now some of those military barracks are yet to be recovered or rebuilt.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the NDA is, therefore, not the first, second or third time that the criminals would attack a military formation. However, this is the only time that the bandits have the audacity to take their fight to a military training institution. This is very unfortunate because they were so daring.\n\n\u201cI still believe that the Nigerian Army and the Armed Forces have well-trained personnel who had done well in international engagements.\n\n\u201cSo they have the capacity just that they are overwhelmed because they are facing many challenges from different fronts. There is no part of the country that is free of security challenges.\n\n\u201cI believe the insecurity situation is at its peak and the terrorists are engaging in guerilla warfare to send signals that they had not been eliminated.\n\n\u201cI have the confidence that before the end of the week, the military will take decisive action because I know that the commandant of the NDA, being a gallant soldier had embarked on a massive manhunt that would yield results,\u201d Ndume stated.\n\nMilitary Remains Committed To National Security \u2013 Sawyerr\n\nThe Defence Headquarters has reassured Nigerians that the military under the current leadership of the Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor is committed to national security and peaceful coexistence among citizens and would do everything within its constitutional mandate to uphold the unity, faith and progress of the country.\n\nThis is despite the worsening insecurity which resulted in the recent attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna.\n\nThe director, defence information, Major General Benjamin Sawyerr, gave the assurance while visiting the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Channels TV and News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in continuation of his familiarisation tour to media outfits in Abuja.\n\nIn a statement by the deputy director defence information, Air Cdre Wap Maigida, Sawyerr said personnel of the armed forces under the current leadership are committed to the peaceful cohabitation of Nigerians and would guide against disintegration and collapse of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria is the institution that holds the country together, anywhere you see a failed state, it is because the armed forces has collapsed,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified prompt dissemination of public information which he said must be credible, fair, balance and devoid of bias, while further reiterating the roles of the media as the watch dog of the society.\n\nHe appealed to the media to propagate news that seek to promote peace, which is a necessary requirement for unity and tranquility.\n\nThe director general, NTA, Mallam Yakubu Ibn Mohammed, reiterated the importance of information management and dissemination of information most especially at this period when the nation is faced with the fight against insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and other vices.\n\nHe called on media practitioners to ensure that they manage information by taking cognizance of the nation\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cThe media need to manage information, knowing what to say, how to say it and when to say it, is very critical at this unusual time, which require unusual method,\u201d he said.\n\nDG NTA further enjoined media organisations to ensure as much as possible that their news contents does not compromise national security.\n\nThe Chairman Channels TV, who was represented by the Company\u2019s Secretary, Mrs Adeola Olumeyan, also pledged that Channels TV will sustain it\u2019s partnership with the AFN, specifically in the area of dissemination of vital security information geared towards promoting national peace.\n\nThe Chairman expressed gratitude to the Defence Spokesperson for recognizing the need to collaborate with the media organizations.\n\nIn the same vein, the Managing Director, NAN, Mr Buki Ponle commended the AFN for safeguarding the corporate coexistence of the nation.\n\nHe appealed to media executives to be patriotic in their reportage by supporting the military efforts towards the restoration of peace and normalcy across the various theatres of operations.\n\n\u201cNigeria may be passing through this rumble, I believe the Nation will overcome and the country will emerge better and stronger because we have a strong armed forces,\u201d he said\n\nBreaking: 32 Bethel Baptist Students Regain Freedom\n\nThirty-two of the remaining abducted 63 students of Bethel Baptist High School yesterday regained freedom and reunited with their parents, Kaduna State chairman of the Christain Association of Nigeria (CAN) Rev John Joseph Hayab has disclosed.",

It remains a global threat to public health, an indicator of inequity and lack of social development.\n\nNigeria has witnessed several outbreaks of Cholera over the years. It occurs annually mostly during the rainy season and more often in areas with poor sanitation.\n\nBlueprint Weekend findings show that the first series of cholera outbreaks was reported between 1970 and 1990. Major epidemics also occurred in 1992, 1995-1996, and 1997.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health reported 37,289 cases and 1,434 deaths between January and October 2010, while a total of 22,797 cases of cholera with 728 deaths and case-fatality rate of 3.2% were recorded in 2011.\n\n\u201cOutbreaks were also recorded in 2018 with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reporting 42,466 suspected cases including 830 deaths with a case fatality rate of 1.95 per cent from 20 out of 36 states from the beginning of 2018 to October 2018.\n\n\u2026 More deaths\n\nAside from the 1,178 deaths in 23 states and the FCT earlier recorded by the NCDC, seven people were killed on Monday in Tella Town in Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba state.\n\nThe Taraba state Commissioner of Health, Dr. Innocent Vakkai, who confirmed the outbreak to journalists in Jalingo, said several others have been hospitalised in health care centres in the area following severe stooling and vomiting.\n\nHe noted that a team of medical experts from the ministry of health have been dispatched to the area to investigate the reported cases and report back.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Gassol Local Government, Alhaji Musa Chul, told our correspondent on phone that at least 25 people were on admission at the Tella Maternity Clinic with symptoms of cholera.\n\nHe said the council received a report from Tella on Saturday evening that three people had died from vomiting and stoolling.\n\nThe council boss disclosed that he had detailed the local government health team to the village to investigate the incident the following day, Sunday.\n\nWhat drives infection?\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend on what drives the recurrence of Cholera, a public health physician and Secretary, Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Kogi state, Dr Samuel Akojie, said findings had shown that the disease was mostly driven by a combination of biological, social, environmental and climatic, health systems, among others.\n\nHe said there is little or no awareness of good hygiene practices in most parts of the country fuels Cholera.\n\nAkojie added that in some cases even when individuals are aware of good hygiene practices, they lack access to soap, safe water and washing facilities they need to make positive changes to protect themselves and their community.\n\nHe said, \u201cWithout improved sanitation, a facility that safely separates human waste from human contact, people have no choice but practice open defecation.\n\n\u201cIn the immediate environment, the exposed faecal matter will be transferred back into people\u2019s food and water resources, helping to spread cholera.\n\n\u201cAgain, lack of effective waste disposal or sewerage systems can contaminate ecosystems and contribute to pandemics.\n\n\u201cAnd without access to improved drinking water such as a protected borehole well or municipal piped supply, people will rely on surface water, unprotected and possibly contaminated wells, or vendors selling water of unverifiable provenance and quality.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today, even in the urban areas, access to safe water remains a problem. In communities, sources are usually far from their homes.\u201d\n\nAkojie emphasized the need for regular hand washing as it could reduce infection by 60 per cent.\n\nHe stressed the need for the government to intensify community education on cholera, especially on how to prevent cholera, provide a good environmental sanitation system, and maintain a strong community linked-surveillance system to alert the LGA by community members and subsequent investigation of suspected cases of cholera.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve no business recording large-scale outbreak\u2019\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a public health expert Dr Francisca Oyedele said Nigeria has no business recording such a large-scale outbreak of cholera, blaming the development on the fact that the conditions that bring about the disease were still much in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThese conditions are poor personal hygiene, poor knowledge and unsafe behaviour by communities on how to keep good hygiene such as regular hand washing, how to boil and filter water for use, proper faecal waste disposal, poor housing with lack of toilet facilities and community hygiene hence the common practice of open defecation and lack of potable water.\n\n\u201cCholera is caused by bacteria that is ingested from food or water contaminated by faecal matter.\n\n\u201cFor food or water to be contaminated by faces, it is, therefore, a disease common where there is poor hygiene and lack of access to potable water. It is a disease of water, sanitation and hygiene.\u201d\n\nAttention to state, LGA panacea \u2013 Expert\n\nWhile noting that the disease was more common in slums and refugee camps, including areas where hygiene and sanitation was poor and there was poor housing, Oyedele said to put the disease in check, Nigeria\u2019s focus should be more on educating affected communities early enough on hand washing and food hygiene to reduce contamination.\n\n\u201cThis is where the press can help to get correct and consistent information to the people and give feedback to the government.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for the government to ensure provision of potable water across communities and good housing with functional toilets for proper waste disposal. A well-constructed pit latrine with proper safety measures to prevent flies from access to it can be a start.\n\n\u201cThere should also be proper and good governance, using the SDGS and Goals in the National Plans as benchmarks.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Convener of Development Connect, a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO), Hamzat Isah, stressed the need for the government to fund and strengthen the Primary HealthCare system where a system of community disease surveillance and response can be made to work properly.\n\nHe said NCDC cannot be in every ward or in all 774 LGAs in Nigeria but can only coordinate at the national level\n\n\u201cThe real work is at the community, wards and Local Government Areas. The NCDC and States Emergency Operation Committees are to support, coordinate and give technical assistance to these Local Government Area Emergency Response (EPR) teams.\n\n\u201cThis is the bottom-up approach called Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) part of the Health System.\n\n\u201cAt the PHC level in the 774 LGAs as designed, there should be 774 functional Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) Committees of Community representatives that work through 774 Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) of technical health teams that work on outbreak prevention and response together.\u201d\n\nIsah regretted that little or no work was being done at the state and local government levels where sensitisation in the markets, amongst CDAs, religious places and most especially amongst schools should be carried out.\n\nDoctor\u2019s strike\n\nEqually, further checks by Blueprint Weekend revealed that the ongoing strike by the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) was affecting response to the outbreak in the country.\n\nSpeaking on the implications of the strike, a medical doctor Michael Ukonu, who is part of the striking NARD, admitted that the strike was affecting response to Cholera.\n\nUkonu said the country\u2019s health sector is in a \u201cfragile state\u201d and called on the federal government to ensure that promises made to health workers are fulfilled.\n\n\u201cNo doubt the ongoing strike by medical doctors is affecting the response to the ongoing response to the outbreak of Cholera. However, if promises have been made they should be fulfilled and it should not get to the point where doctors will down tools. Nobody wants that,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further Ukonu said, \u201cThere are needless deaths. The national government needs to pay more attention to health workers as a whole, not just doctors. The developed countries have made it so easy for nurses and doctors to come to the UK, US and Canada.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s response\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Environment, Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar, has said the federal government would soon inaugurate National Environmental Sanitation Response Intervention to Cholera Outbreak.\n\nAddressing journalists on the cholera outbreak, Monday in Abuja, the minister said it has become urgent to sensitise the general public on the outbreak and efforts made by the ministry to contain the scourge.\n\nHe said as part of efforts to combat the diseases, the ministry would be flagging off the National Environmental Sanitation Response Intervention to Cholera Outbreak in Kubwa, Abuja which is currently the epi-centre in the FCT.\n\nThe minister, therefore, charged state and local governments and other stakeholders to step up their sanitation and hygiene programmes and activities to curb the spread of the disease.\n\nHe said that the ministry in collaboration with relevant stakeholders including Environmental Health Officer\u2019s (EHO\u2019s) in the states and local government areas would embark on nationwide intervention response activities.\n\nAbubakar also said that the ministry had activated sanitation desks in the 36 state offices of the ministry, including the FCT, adding that the effort was for effective response to the outbreak.\n\nHe urged the head of the desks to carry out environmental sanitation activities in their various states aimed at containing the outbreak.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this briefing is to sensitise the media and general public on the cholera outbreak in the country and the efforts being made by the ministry to contain the scourge.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Nigeria is currently experiencing a cholera outbreak in several parts of the country with reported cases of fatalities.\n\n\u201cThe ministry had requested the EHOs in the states and local governments across the country to intensify their efforts in carrying out sanitary inspection of premises and abatement of nuisances,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the ministry with the relevant stakeholders in the states and local government areas will embark on nationwide intervention response activities.\n\nHe said this would cover the areas such as sanitary inspection of premises/environmental health surveillance of hotspot communities.\n\n\u201cSanitary inspection of schools primary and secondary in affected communities as well as training of community volunteers on safe water handling, environmental sanitation and hygiene practices.\n\n\u201cAlso, sanitary inspection of food business premises of affected communities advocacy, sensitisation and community town hall meetings on control of open defecation practices and its health impact, among others,\u2019\u2019 the minister added.\n\nAbubakar also urged all levels of government, including the commissioners for environment, across the country to step up their sanitation and hygiene programmes to control and prevent further outbreak and spread of cholera.\n\nHe assured that the ministry was committed to ensuring a clean and healthy environment for all Nigerians.",
          "summary": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, (NCDC) said the country had recorded 37,819 suspected cases of cholera, 1,178 deaths in 23 states and the FCT as at August 14, 2021.\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health reported 37,289 cases and 1,434 deaths between January and October 2010, while a total of 22,797 cases of cholera with 728 deaths and case-fatality rate of 3.2% were recorded in 2011.\nHe said there is little or no awareness of good hygiene practices in most parts of the country fuels Cholera.\n\u201cNo doubt the ongoing strike by medical doctors is affecting the response to the ongoing response to the outbreak of Cholera.\n\u201cAs you are aware, Nigeria is currently experiencing a cholera outbreak in several parts of the country with reported cases of fatalities.",

          "text": "A chieftain of All Progressives Congress, APC , and Director General of Voice of Nigeria, VON, Mr Osita Okechukwu, has asked leaders of All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, to collapse the party and fuse into the APC as a pragmatic step towards successful and seamless prosecution of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nThe APC chieftain maintained that APGA and APC have a history of long cosy political understanding dating even back to 2013 when a faction of APGA joined the merger of APC, adding that one cannot in 2017, forget how President Muhammadu Buhari more or less saved His Excellency Wille Obiano from his traducers, hence his re-election.\n\nOkechukwu, who is also one of the founding members of APC, said it was that background of the cordial relationship that informed his recent counsel to APGA\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, that suggestion was made from the prism of the pragmatic Zikist political model, which joins us with APGA. Pragmatism is the best strategy for Ndigbo to kill two birds with one stone, because if APGA fuses into APC that will gift APC with three states in the Southeast geopolitical zone \u2013 a milestone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith three strategic states of Southeast in APC\u2019s kitty, that is a halfway stroke to Ndigbo\u2019s ambition of achieving Nigeria president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Therefore, I implore you to kindly consider the fruit in APGA joining APC to win the Anambra governorship. Other details will be cordially harmonized.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy take is that if the two parties-APGA and APC-come together under one bloc, it would then be possible for us to weigh the two flag bearers, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo and Senator Andy Uba, on the scale of which of them could better win the election in terms of acceptability, integrity, public service record, capacity and vision for good governance,\u201d the VON DG stated.\n\nOkechukwu, while faulting the claim by Chinedu Obidigwe that APC was plotting a forceful takeover of Anambra State insisted that the feasibility of his suggestion could be seen from the political understanding between the All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 1999.\n\nHe recalled: \u201cwe must recall that in 1999, based on strategic thinking, AD and APP were merged for the Presidential election.\n\n\u201cBut, although the powers that be wanted Chief Olusegun Obasanjo of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), every stakeholder in APP and AD, and indeed all progressive Nigerians saw the political understanding as a win-win offering on the ballot. So, with the benefit of hindsight, I am seeing the same opportunity for APGA and APC in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nObidigwe, the National Coordinator of APGA Media Warriors, had in a statement to journalists, criticised Okechukwu for asking APGA to integrate fully into APC and join the mainstream of Nigeria politics so as to help Igbo pick the Presidential seat in 2023.\n\nBut, Okechukwu told reporters in Abuja, yesterday, that APGA was missing the point by seeking to remain as a big fish in a small pond of regional politics that has only earned it just one state out of the entire federation.\n\nHe insisted that APGA can, apart from solving its intractable myriad of post-governorship primary litigations join its old ally, APC, to win the governorship, insisted on doing the same thing the same way and expecting a different result.\n\nThe VON DG pleaded with APGA leaders to give serious thoughts to his pragmatic suggestions, noting that indeed the time has come for APGA to explore other avenues to achieve the collective purpose for Ndigbo by teaming up with APC.\n\n\u201cThis tunnel vision of rigid partisanship has remained the bane of Southeast politics. Therefore, I am still calling on my friends in APGA to look up and count the stars. In 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari restored Governor Obiano\u2019s security details on the APC governorship campaign ground. In 2019, Obiano led APGA to reciprocate the grand political gesture of understanding by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, would it not make for a greater political impact and success, if APGA consummates what its leaders started right from 2014 by embracing APC in a closer embrace? They should show patriotism and respect for the campaign for Nigeria President of Igbo extraction by joining the mainstream, which APC\u2019s victory in the governorship poll will enhance,\u201d Okechukwu contended.",

This brings the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses donated to Nigeria from the UK through COVAX to 1,292,640 doses in August alone.\n\n\u201cThese vaccines delivered to Nigeria are part of over five million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that the UK has donated through COVAX, the scheme designed to ensure equitable, global access to COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe statement further read that: \u201cThis latest batch is part of the Senegal, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Pakistan. Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, 9 million COVID-19 vaccines the UK has donated around the world since the end of July 2021.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that these UK-donated doses are part of a broader pledge to share 100 million vaccines with the rest of the world by June 2022, noting that 80% of these doses will be shared through the COVAX Facility, with 30 million due to be sent by the end of 2021.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was said to have made the pledge at the UK-hosted G7 Leaders\u2019 Summit earlier this year.\n\nThe UK has led the international response to COVID-19, including through kick-starting efforts to establish the COVAX Facility in 2020, providing \u00a3548 million to fund vaccines for lower income countries, and so far, the COVAX Facility has delivered more than 152 million vaccine doses to over 137 countries and territories, including in 83 lower-middle income countries.\n\nCOVAX aimed to deliver 1.8 billion vaccines to lower-income countries by early 2022, according to the statement.\n\nThe statement further revealed that the UK has also invested \u00a390 million to support the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, with over a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been delivered at a non-profit price globally, with two-thirds going to lower- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe statement said \u201cas one of the largest COVAX donors, the UK continues to play a global role in promoting an effective roll- out of the vaccine. In Nigeria, we are supporting a Nigerian-led response and work closely with Nigerian- based partners, including UNICEF, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHDCDA) and the World Health Organisation.\u201d\n\nActing British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Gill Atkinson, was quoted in the statement to have said: \u201cThe UK continues to promote global efforts to help every country receive the vaccine against Covid-19. I am so pleased to see Nigeria receive an extra 592,880 doses donated by the UK, which brings the total this month to 1,292,640 doses. This will help Nigeria meet its urgent need for vaccines.\n\n\u201cOnly by vaccinating more people around the world can we bring an end to the global coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Dr. Seth Berkley,, was quoted to have said: \u201cThese latest shipments of U.K.-donated doses means more people will benefit from life-saving vaccines. We thank Britain for its support for COVAX and its objective to make sure the most vulnerable, everywhere, are protected against the virus.\u201d",

He knows what we feel about him and if he was ever going to move away from Juventus, he knows that we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nManchester City had looked to be one of the favourites to land the former Real Madrid player when some reports suggested personal terms had already been agreed between the two.\n\nSpeaking before City face Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday, manager Pep Guardiola said: \u201cCristiano is a Juventus player.

Juventus remains, which is the most important thing.\n\n\u201cHe is to be thanked for what he has done, also as an example among the youngsters. But as I said, we must go on.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, Ronaldo informed his Juventus colleagues he was set to leave this month after two years at the 36-time Serie A champions.\n\nHe then drove to the training ground on Friday morning but left before taking part in the session.\n\nA week ago, Allegri said Ronaldo had \u201cnever expressed a desire to leave\u201d Juventus, and that the player had told him he was staying at the Allianz Stadium.\n\nRonaldo himself called media speculation about his future \u201ca disrespect for me as a man and as a player\u201d in a lengthy Instagram post a few days earlier.",
