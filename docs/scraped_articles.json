          "text": "\u2026Says repeated declarations made to CCB before I became Gov, petition is frivolous\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nTHE crisis rocking the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is taking another dimension as Senator Seriake Dickson of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Bayelsa West said Tuesday that his family assets were acquired in 2007 with loans.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, Senator Dickson who described the petition against him as frivolous, said that he made repeated declarations to the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB before he became the Governor of Bayelsa State.\n\nSenator Dickson\u2019s statement read, \u201cAbout two weeks ago I received an invitation from the EFCC to clarify some issues relating to assets declarations as alleged by an NGO.\n\n\u201cOn account of our busy schedule at the time, I wrote to inform them and we agreed to reschedule the interview for today.\n\n\u201cAs a law abiding citizen and with a life long commitment to supporting Law enforcement and security agencies, I honored the invitation today as rescheduled. I understand that the subject matter of the inquiry relates to investments of my family trust, which I incorporated while being a member of the House of Reps to hold my family assets and investments which were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became Governor.\n\n\u201cI understand that there is a petition from an NGO alleging that these investments (largely buildings, plots, farms, etc in my village, Orua, Yenagoa, and two buy-to-let houses in the UK) were not declared. I have a duty to clarify these issues with the investigating authorities who by law have the responsibility to inquire into these matters.\n\n\u201cHowever, for the avoidance of doubts, let me state that my family investments, Seriake Dickson Trust Incorporated were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became Governor.\n\n\u2018These investments were funded by loans and advances and repaid from salaries, allowances, savings and others. One of them is still on mortgage and I have made these documents available to the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThese investments were declared in my assets declaration form at the House of Reps in 2011; my Governorship form in 2012, 2016, 2020 after I left office and the Senate Assets declaration form this year.\n\n\u201cI went beyond these declarations and wrote several letters to the appropriate agencies, copies of which have been made available to the EFCC. My trust and I subscribed to the federal government Voluntary Assets Income AND Declaration Scheme (VAIDES) and also paid the necessary taxes.\n\n\u201cAs a result of blackmail from some quarters, the Trust and I went to the Federal High Court where there is a subsisting judgement declaring that no Nigerian law is breached by a public officer who takes loans and other verifiable avenues to make investments for his family provided these are declared.\n\n\u201cIt should be on record that I have since resigned from the Trust Administration since 2011 before I became Governor.\n\n\u201cMy solicitors and those of the trust have written to the EFCC to clarify these issues with the accompanying documents.\n\n\u201cHowever on getting to the commission, the investigating team came up with a new allegation of diversion of flood funds in 2012 totaling N17.5 billion. The petition further alleged that the money was used for my re-election in 2019. The fact is that there was no such donation about the 2012 flood in Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cCuriously, there was no mention of donor or where the money came from. There was also no re-election for governorship in Bayelsa in 2019 which are clear proofs that the petition was totally frivolous.\n\n\u201cThe commission after looking into these allegations have since asked me to return home on self recognition. I have authorized this statement to be released for the avoidance of any misinformation.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026As body launches request management system, chatbot\n\nBy Elizabeth Osayande\n\nThe head of the Nigeria national office, West African Examination Council, WAEC, Mr Patrick Areghan has on Tuesday announced the timetable for the conduct of this West African Senior School Certificate Examination, WASSCE for school candidates.\n\nAccording to the body, the examination will run from Monday, August 16 to Friday October 8 across the sub-regions, with Nigeria concluding her examination on September 30.\n\nMr. Areghan also announced launch of WAEC request management system/ chatbot at a press briefing held at WAEC national office, Yaba, Lagos.\n\nHe said:\u201d We have invited you here today to acquaint you with the preparations we have made for the smooth and successful conduct of the WASSCE (SC) 2021 as well as to witness the official launch of our newest product \u2013 REQUEST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND WAEC-CHATBOT, designed to address the immediate needs of our stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the Final International Timetable, the WASSCE (SC) 2021 will take place throughout the sub-region from Monday, 16th August to Friday, 8th October, 2021. However, the examination will end in Nigeria on 30th September, 2021 \u2013 spanning a period of seven (07) weeks.\n\n\u201cThe statistics for the examination shows that Nineteen Thousand, Four Hundred and Twenty Five (19,425) recognized secondary schools, comprising Eight Thousand and Fifty-Two (8.052) public and Eleven Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Three (11,373) private schools, spread across the nooks and crannies of the thirty-six (36) states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja would be presenting a total of One Million, Five Hundred and Seventy-Three Thousand, Seven Hundred and Eighty-Nine (1,573,789) candidates, comprising 792,620 males (50.36%) and 781,169 females (49.64%), for the examination. Candidates would be examined in 76 subjects, made up of 197 papers. About 25,000 senior teachers would be participating in the examination as supervisors\u201d he said.\n\nOn the reasons this year\u2019s examination will be conducted in the month of August instead May/June, WAEC boss explained that the need to present an international timetable coupled with the disruption caused by Covid-19; the need to align with Nigeria\u2019s emergency academic calendar; and the request by the federal government were factors responsible for the shift in date.\n\nMr Areghan who noted that the management will adhere to Covid-19 protocols, including ensuring compliance by all stakeholders, said that body was liaising with security agencies to ensure smooth sail of the examination.\n\nThe WAEC boss also reiterated the body zero-tolerance stance against all forms of malpractices; rogue- website operators; the so called miracle centres.\n\nPart of his statement: \u201cWe are also closely watching out for the so-called \u2018Special\u2019 or \u2018Miracle\u2019 centres. These are not coinages by WAEC. They exist only in the imaginations of the perpetrators and patronizers. Even though we cannot claim to be oblivious of such a scenario, they are centres where candidates are promised assistance for cheap grades by \u2018examination contractors\u2019. We will definitely not allow them. No matter how remotely located they are, our in-built anti-malpractice mechanism will fish them out. It will not be wise to spend a whole six years preparing for the examination, only to end up not getting any result. So please, be warned!\u201d\n\nThe Head of WAEC, Nigeria called on candidates to ensure that they have their National identification number, NIN as candidates will not be allowed to take subsequent examination.\n\nHis words: \u201cLet me also use this medium to announce that as we continue to make progress in the conduct of the Council\u2019s business in Nigeria, National Identification Number (NIN) will become a major requirement for registration for the WASSCE examination with effect from the WASSCE for School Candidates, 2022 and subsequent diets (No NIN, no entry!).\n\n\u201cThis means that all prospective candidates must register with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) and get their National Identification Number (NIN). This is in line with the Federal Government\u2019s Policy, as directed by the Federal Ministry of Education. \u201d He said.\n\nMr. Areghan who thanked the Honourable Minister of Education for his support, added that WAEC was working with other relevant stakeholders to ensure a smooth hitched-free conduct of WASSCE for school candidates.\n\nHe added that the final timetable has been sent to all schools throughout WAEC branches and zonal offices for proper guidance.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Insecurity: Need for sustained military and intelligence operations",
          "text": "By Sunday Onyemaechi Eze\n\n..Security is development; without security, there can be no development\u2014 Robert McNamara\n\nIT is no longer news that the security challenges confronting the nation have assumed a frightening and worrisome dimension. Unarguably, they are becoming intractable by the day. The gnawing fear and apprehension is palpable. It is choking to say the least. The menace has unfortunately become a constant, dangerous and terrible part of our new normal way of life.We are on a daily basis inundated with the horrendous stories of the evils perpetrated by many notorious criminal groups in the country.\n\nFor over a decade and counting, the nation has been stewed in the blood of innocent citizens murdered either by Boko Haram/ISWAP, bandits, herders, armed robbers, unknown gunmen, cultist and kidnappers. Has the nation applied the right approach to putting an end to this menace? Those at the helm of affairs genuinely need to look inward to find the desired answers.\n\nA recent Daily Trust report revealed that 1031 people were brutally murdered as a result of insecurity in Kebbi and Niger states in June 2021 alone. In Borno State, for instance, Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists have established over a decade of presence and undisrupted murderous attacks. They have audaciously imposed taxes in their strongholds and formed a well-tailored administrative structure with the appointment of a governor.\n\nGovernor Aminu Masari of Katsina State recently admitted that 10 out of the 34 local governments in the state are under the control of rogue elements. An Abuja community, for instance, had received a letter from kidnappers demanding for the sum of N100,000 per family or be ready to face the consequences of their insubordinate actions.\n\nPrivate homes, travellers and even peasant farmers are not spared in these constant attacks and kidnaps either. Unfortunately, innocent school children have become soft targets and items of exchange for ransom. The ugly events of Tegina Islamic School in Niger State and Bethel School, Kaduna and many others are sad reminders of the obvious state of hopelessness and damage insecurity has inflicted on our society.\n\nIn recent days, the kidnap of traditional rulers has been added to the staple of the barbaric acts. Report has it that 113 traditional rulers were kidnapped within a period of three years in the country. Who is next, one may ask? The gory tales of the woes which have befallen the nation are mind-boggling and echoing almost everywhere. The nation is now in a deep vortex of violent extremism/terrorism, secessionist agitations and other forms of security challenges that may lead to anarchy.\n\nThe number of refugees and internally- displaced persons produced by insurgency in North East is a testimony of the level of humanitarian crisis the nation is contending with. More than 13,000 lives or more were also said to have been lost in 10 years, including properties running into millions. Renewed attacks in Benue, Kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto, Katsina and Niger states now leave them facing serious humanitarian challenges.\n\nIt is obvious that the Infantry Corps of the Nigerian Army shoulders the major burden of military interventions in the prevailing security situations in the country. The military generally has always promptly risen to the occasion of defending the sovereignty of the country. Therefore, they should be commended for their dedication, sacrifice and professionalism in discharging their duties, especially while dealing with the rising wave of insecurity which has taken a toll on the nation for over a decade now.\n\nThe appointment of Major General Victor Ezugwu as the Commander of the Infantry Corps by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, like every other key appointments made by the Army chief are well intentioned to reposition the Nigerian Army for efficiency. Major Gen. Ezugwu was the Acting GOC 7 Division Nigerian Army, Mauduguri, thus he understood the urgency of the responsibilities at hand and the challenges to create the desired impact. In conjunction with the new theatre Commander, Joint Tasks Force, Northeast, \u2018Operation Hadin Kai\u2019, Major General Christopher Musa and other field commanders; their professionalism and cooperation will largely come to bear in winning the war.\n\nIn fact, one would be right to conclude that the Army is highly overburdened and also fatigued. Weapons and artillery to conveniently wage the war are said to be in short supply. Video outbursts of some officers and men expressing their frustration on the reality on ground in front lines are rife.\n\nWhile it could be professionally embarrassing for the military to hear and watch such sad commentaries made by soldiers, the Army could run with the message for greater performance and general efficiency. In the final analysis, the concerns raised by these soldiers are good for immediate adjustments. They serve as that unwanted vehicle for improvements and introduction of new strategies.\n\nThe Army cannot do it alone. One finger cannot remove a lice from the head, goes the old saying. That is why sustained joint military and intelligence operations (aerial, ground and water if necessary) are key to confronting the challenge. The roles of the Department of State Services, DSS; the Nigerian Intelligence Agency, NIA; and other sister security agencies are also vital components relevant to addressing the problem. Community-related cooperation and assistance in conflict areas should be maximised. Intelligence gathered from and information volunteered by those directly affected by insecurity does more than one could imagine.\n\nOccasional aerial bombardment of enclaves of the bandits and kidnappers by the Nigerian Airforce had no doubt yielded some level of desired results with a high number of them neutralised, arms recovered or destroyed. Some have surrendered, repented and reintegrated into the society.\n\nHowever, more of this aerial campaign is required in addition to corresponding ground offensive. With once upon a time assault, the criminals are given ample time to regroup, refocus and restrategise and continue with their evil business. At least a six months sustained combination of both aerial and ground assault is good enough to create the needed confusion in the camps of the criminal elements.\n\nThe audacity of the bandits to serially sack military formations and capacity to shoot down a fighter jet even in the night is a pointer to the rising sophistication of the groups. It is now more glaring that these people should be addressed and adequately treated as who they are: Terrorists! The military in its entirety and the Nigerian intelligence community should brace up and come up with the required strategy to be able to conquer and eliminate the problem once and for all.\n\nEze, a media and communication specialist, wrote via: sunnyeze02andahoo.com",

          "text": "By Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nLabour and Employment Minister, Chris Ngige has taken a swipe at the Director \u2013 General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman for blaming him for the ongoing strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors(NARD).\n\nNgige described Lukman\u2019s comments as an \u201cexpression of grave ignorance and crass emptiness\u201d on the ongoing strike of NARD and the standoff between Kaduna State Government and Organised Labour.\n\nThe Minister, who expressed disappointment with the PGF DG\u2019s utterances, described the statement credited to Lukman in the media as \u201cnauseating, malicious and nonsensical.\u201d\n\nLukman had in a statement said the lethargic responses of Ngige and his Health counterpart, Dr Osagie Ehanire, culminated in the strikes in the health sector and consequent loss of lives.\n\nBut, reacting in a statement by his media office signed by Emmanuel Nzomiwu, Ngige said the PGF DG must have spoken either out of \u201cignorance or malicious intent to smear the two respected members of the Federal cabinet who had put in sleepless nights, engaging in meaningful negotiations, to ensure industrial peace in the health sector at this critical period of COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, it is shocking and outrageously incredible for somebody in his right mind to say that the two Ministers, who are both experienced medical doctors, were unable to proactively pre-empt strikes in the health sector.\n\nNgige noted there was no strike notice from NARD in accordance with the Trade Disputes Act as there was nothing like resumption of a suspended strike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Minister, last week invoked Section 43 of the Act, which states that for the period a worker withdraws his services, his employers have the right not to pay his wages.\n\nThe Minister, in the statement, argued that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Principles at work, supports this.\n\n\u201cMr. Lukman has therefore displayed his shallow knowledge of labour dispute resolution and management by alleging that Ministers Ngige and Ehanire could have proactively stopped this strike and even went further to castigate Ngige over the Kaduna State Government/NLC dispute, which led to a four-day strike,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNgige said as essential workers, the resident doctors are not expected to go on strike without giving at least 15 days notice to the minister of labour.\n\n\u201cAb initio, on 31st of January, 2021 NARD issued notice of strike detailing their demands and were invited by the Minister with the first meeting held in February. Further meetings in which their employers, the Ministry of Health was invited.\n\n\u201cThese meetings culminated in signing of a Memorandum of Action on 31st of March 2021. The NARD President fell ill during the discussion and left but his Deputy and Secretary, signed the MOA. They were happy and Government agreed to look at this MOA. To the chagrin of all, by April 1, same NARD declared a strike, worse on the eve of Easter.\n\n\u201cThey were brought back and expressed misgivings in some areas in the MOA and re-negotiation started. They also accepted that some of the issues they held were in error. So, by April 9, both the Government and NARD signed an addendum to areas of the resident doctors\u2019 concern and fixed timelines for those things to be actualised and they were all actualised.\n\n\u201cTheir Residency Training Fund was paid and the issue of House officers addressed to the satisfaction of NARD. The recruitment of House Officers is now being handled online by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) to ensure a level playing field for all applicant doctors. you are now to be placed in teaching hospitals.\n\n\u201cAs of today, over N3 billion has been released for Residency Training Fund. They submitted names and payment started. NARD however claim that about 114 house officers from that stream have not been paid nationally, out of over 40 hospitals that are Federal Government owned. This is not inclusive of state owned hospitals . Unfortunately, all the blames are being heaped on the Federal government. Some of the 114 are people who have supplied details that are not correct. But 114 is an infinitesimal number. Of course, they have been asked to resubmit these details,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn the issue of those removed from the scheme of service, Ngige noted that House officers had never been on the scheme of service, which is a career path for doctors in the civil service which ought not, including internship doctors who may decide not to practice at the end of their training.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cAfter all, pharmacists, nurses and physiotherapists are equally doing internship. In spite, there is a salary wage structure that has captured that entry point for doctors; MSS 1 . Therefore nothing has gone off the monies due to them.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioners for Health from the 36 states and FCT in their council on establishment, asked their Chairperson, the Head of Service of the Federation for a circular that all the interns in the civil service should be removed from the scheme of service for that one year. This certainly cannot be the grievance of doctors as it did not touch their earnings.\n\n\u201cImmediately the doctors raised alarm on the circular, the Minister contacted the Head of Service of the Federation who confirmed that nothing was lost by the doctors as a result of the circular, the matter having been discussed with the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA),\n\n\u201cEven when they raised its negative implication in Lagos state service package for doctors, it adds to nothing as it is completely a state matter.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, insurance for medical doctors by the Federal Government has been in place in 2020 and has been renewed for year 2021 with over N9 billion as premium. Evidence was tendered at the last meeting on July 22 by the Office of Head of Service of the Federation to show that payment has started . The Federal Government is ready but NARD has not supplied the list of these 19 dead doctors said to have been omitted.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of doctors on GFMIS yet to be paid between seven to eight months salaries, the matter is already being handled but not yet perfected while a standing committee has been constituted for that.\n\n\u201c Let\u2019s put on record that after the meeting on July 22, the same NARD leadership showered thanks and praises on Ngige and promised to go and report back to their members, only to turn around and declare another indefinite strike. The issue of migration of NARD members to IPPIS platform would be addressed by the committee.\n\n\u201cWe have to note also that the claim by NARD that the Medical Residency Training fund was yet to be paid for 2020 and 2021 is false.\n\n\u201cThe 2020 was paid and even in payment of 2020, the resident doctors injected names of people who are not qualified to receive the money. There were their members who had finished and left that were also paid because they supplied the names. Some of their members didn\u2019t get because those who are not fit and proper persons to earn the money, had taken away this money. The resident doctors pledged to get these people to refund the money. The 2021 is captured in service wide votes in the 2021 supplementary budget under service wide votes.\n\n\u201cAgain, it is workers who are drawing back the meeting on the issue of hazard allowance as the Federal Government had long ago earmarked N37.5 billion for it.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Labour is alive to his responsibilities. He deserves commendation rather than vilification, for making sure that industrial disputes do not escalate to the point of going to either the Industrial Arbitration Panel (IAP) or National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN). We will not go to IAP or NICN. Disputes only move up to the IAP and to NICN when conciliation fails at the level Ministry. Importantly, all disputes that have been apprehended by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment since 2015 have been effectively and satisfactorily conciliated, hence no need to send upstairs but the statistics at the IAP and NICN will show that the private sector, especially oil and gas unions have been referred to the Arbitration Panel and industrial Court. Instead of Lukman praising the successes of a Minister of APC, his jaundiced eyes didn\u2019t permit him. On record, the Ministry under Ngige has till date conciliated over 1680 disputes, leaving little or nothing for IAP and NICN.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from signing a Memorandum of Understanding in the case of Kaduna State, everything brought by NLC against the Kaduna State Government was earlier forwarded to Governor El-Rufai. Our information is that the DG of PGF was a former employee of Kaduna State Government before he took up his current position. Why did he not thank Ngige for intervening in the matter as far back as 2017 when teachers were sacked. Ngige stopped ILO from suspending Nigeria because NLC reported Kaduna and Kogi State Governments. Remember that Kaduna Government used police against labour. Lukman\u2019s claim is quite preposterous because in 2017, the Minister apprehended the strike and summoned both the NLC and Kaduna State Government to a series of meeting, one of which was attended by the Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai.\u201d",
          "summary": "Ngige described Lukman\u2019s comments as an \u201cexpression of grave ignorance and crass emptiness\u201d on the ongoing strike of NARD and the standoff between Kaduna State Government and Organised Labour.\nNgige noted there was no strike notice from NARD in accordance with the Trade Disputes Act as there was nothing like resumption of a suspended strike.\nTo the chagrin of all, by April 1, same NARD declared a strike, worse on the eve of Easter.\nOur information is that the DG of PGF was a former employee of Kaduna State Government before he took up his current position.\nNgige stopped ILO from suspending Nigeria because NLC reported Kaduna and Kogi State Governments.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has quizzed a former Bayelsa Governor and senator representing Bayesla West Seriake Dickson over his family assets in the United Kingdom and alleged diversion of funds of about N17. 5billion.\n\nBut Dickson said the affected assets were acquired before he became Governor.\n\nHe said he had consistently declared the assets with the Code of Conduct Bureau(CCB).\n\nHe also described the petition by a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) on diversion of funds totaling N17. 5billion as frivolous.\n\nAccording to a source, Dickson presented himself to the EFCC following an invitation by the agency.\n\nThe source said the ex-Governor was grilled over allegations bordering on abuse of office and misappropriation of public funds during his eight-year administration in Bayelsa State between 2012 and 2020.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe former governor who arrived the headquarters of the EFCC in Jabi, Abuja at about 11am was questioned by a team of operatives investigating the allegations against him.\n\n\u201cThough the details of the allegations against the governor were not released, by the EFCC, the allegations relate to issues of assets declaration and misapplication of intervention funds and other assets belonging to the Bayelsa State government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Head of Media and Publicity of EFCC, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the invitation of the former Governor.\n\nIn a statement, which he personally, Dickson described the petition against him by a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) as baseless.\n\nHe said apart from being asked to account for the family assets he acquired before becoming a Governor, he was confronted with a fresh allegation of diversion of funds amounting to N17. 5billion.\n\nHe said the EFCC claimed that an NGO alleged that he used part of the cash for his re-election in 2019.\n\nHe said it was obvious that the petition was faulty because he did not seek re-election in 2019.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cAbout two weeks ago I received an invitation from the EFCC to clarify some issues relating to assets declarations as alleged by an NGO.\n\n\u201cOn account of our busy schedule at the time, I wrote to inform them and we agreed to reschedule the interview for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs a law-abiding citizen and with a life long commitment to supporting Law enforcement and security agencies, I honoured the invitation as rescheduled.\n\n\u201cI understand that the subject matter of the inquiry relates to investments of my family trust, which I incorporated while being a member of the House of Reps to hold my family assets and investments which were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became governor.\n\n\u201cI understand that there is a petition from an NGO alleging that these investments (largely buildings, plots, farms, etc in my village, Orua, Yenagoa, and two buy-to-let houses in the UK) were not declared.\n\n\u201cI have a duty to clarify these issues with the investigating authorities who by law have the responsibility to inquire into these matters.\u201d\n\nDickson explained how he acquired his assets between 1996 and 2012.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cHowever, for the avoidance of doubts, let me state that my family investments, Seriake Dickson Trust Incorporated were made between 1996 and 2012 before I became Governor.\n\n\u201cThese investments were funded by loans and advances and repaid from salaries, allowances, savings and others. One of them is still on mortgage and I have made these documents available to the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThese investments were declared in my assets declaration form at the House of Reps in 2011; my Governorship Form in 2012, 2016, 2020 after I left office and the Senate Assets Declaration Form this year.\n\n\u201cI went beyond these declarations and wrote several letters to the appropriate agencies, copies of which have been made available to the EFCC.\n\n\u201cMy trust and I subscribed to the federal government Voluntary Assets Income AND Declaration Scheme (VAIDES) and also paid the necessary taxes.\n\n\u201cAs a result of blackmail from some quarters, the Trust and I went to the Federal High Court where there is a subsisting judgement declaring that no Nigerian law is breached by a public officer who takes loans and other verifiable avenues to make investments for his family provided these are declared.\n\n\u201cIt should be on record that I have since resigned from the Trust Administration since 2011 before I became Governor.\n\n\u201cMy solicitors and those of the trust have written to the EFCC to clarify these issues with the accompanying documents.\u201d\n\nHe said he witnessed a turn of event when he got to the EFCC and he was confronted with alleged diversion of funds totaling N17. 5billion.\u201d\n\nDickson narrated how he was confronted with a fresh petition by the EFCC outside of what he was invited for.\n\nThe statement said:\u201d However on getting to the commission, the investigating team came up with a new allegation of diversion of flood funds in 2012 totaling N17.5 billion.\n\n\u201cThe petition further alleged that the money was used for my re-election in 2019. The fact is that there was no such donation about the 2012 flood in Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cCuriously, there was no mention of donor or where the money came from. There was also no re-election for governorship in Bayelsa in 2019 which are clear proofs that the petition was totally frivolous.\n\n\u201cThe commission after looking into these allegations have since asked me to return home on self recognition.\n\n\u201cI have authorized this statement to be released for the avoidance of any misinformation.\u201d",

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike\n\nThe West African Examinations Council on Tuesday revealed that 1, 573, 789 million candidates will write the May/June 2021 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), beginning on Monday next week.\n\nWAEC also read the riot act to schools and candidates to avoid examination malpractice. It also accused schools of shopping for external candidates which is against the rules and regulations guiding the exam.\n\nHead of the National Office of WAEC, Mr. Patrick Areghan, who disclosed this, said the school exam will start from Monday, August 16 to Friday, September 30.\n\nAreghan announced that from 2022 candidates wishing to write May/June WASSCE will produce his/her NIN registration number.\n\nThe HNO used the occasion to launch Request Management System and WAEC-CHATBOT, designed to address the immediate needs of its stakeholders.\n\nSaid he: \u201dIn accordance with the final international timetable, the WASSCE 2021 will take place throughout the sub-region from Monday, August 16th, to Friday, October 8th, 2021. However, the examination will end in Nigeria on September 30th, 2021 \u2013 spanning a period of seven weeks.\n\n\u201dThe statistics for the examination shows that 19,425 recognized secondary schools, comprising 8.052 public and 11,373 private schools, spread across the nooks and crannies of the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja would be presenting 1,573,789 candidates, comprising 792,620 males (50.36%) and 781,169 females (49.64%), for the examination.\u201d\n\nThe HNO said candidates would be examined in 76 subjects, made up of 197 papers and that about 25,000 senior teachers would be participating in the examination as supervisors.\n\nHe gave reasons for the school exam holding in August instead of May/June to include the COVID-19 pandemic that caused a disruption and distortion of the academic calendar in the West African Sub-region, \u201dthe final international timetable was drawn in such a way as to cater for the interests of all the five-member countries.\u201d\n\nOther reason are that timetable was specifically drawn to align with Nigeria\u2019s emergency academic calendar and also in deference to the specific request made by the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nAccording to him, the school examination will be conducted under a rather hostile environment, in view of the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic (3rd wave) and the un-abating security challenges in some parts of the country.\n\n\u201dAs you are aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to ravage the world. Therefore, in conducting the examination, we are once again going to religiously adhere to all the prescribed COVID-19 protocols. All examination functionaries have been adequately briefed to ensure compliance.\u201d\n\nAreghan disclosed that schools have been mandated to provide hand sanitizers, running-water buckets and detergent/soap at designated points at all examination centres. He said WAEC supervisors, candidates, invigilators, staff and other examination functionaries would wear their face masks and wash/sanitize their hands regularly in the course of their duties.\n\n\u201dSchools will also provide and operate the thermometer hand-gun on all candidates and examination functionaries at the entrance to the school premises. It is necessary to state here that we are effectively liaising with the various Ministries of Health at the Federal and State levels for their necessary support.\n\n\u201dWe shall ensure that physical and social distancing is maintained by all and sundry. This also means that more personnel and facilities will be required for the conduct of the examination, with the attendant consequences,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn security and insecurity, the HNO said the council have liaised with the relevant security agencies \u201das this is purely within their purview. Moreover, we are trusting God, as usual, for His divine intervention.\u201d\n\nThe HNO warned schools, candidates, supervisors, invigilators, principals and proprietors of schools, and examination functionaries, to desist from all acts of examination malpractice.\n\nHe added: \u201dAll rogue-website operators are hereby seriously warned to desist from their nefarious acts. They should be patriotic citizens and stop giving WAEC a bad name. It is only lazy schools and candidates that resort to examinations malpractice. Any one caught conniving with rogue-website operators or patronizing them will be seriously dealt with. Security agencies are closely monitoring them and their activities.\n\n\u201dSchools and candidates should not allow themselves to be deceived by these fake people and destiny destroyers. Good preparation and self-reliance are the sure keys to success.\n\nWe are also closely watching out for the so-called \u2018Special\u2019 or \u2018Miracle\u2019 centres. These are not coinages by WAEC.\n\n\u201dThey exist only in the imaginations of the perpetrators and patronizers. Even though we cannot claim to be oblivious of such a scenario, they are centres where candidates are promised assistance for cheap grades by \u2018examination contractors\u2019. We will definitely not allow them. No matter how remotely located they are, our in-built anti-malpractice mechanism will fish them out. It will not be wise to spend a whole six years preparing for the examination, only to end up not getting any result. So please, be warned.\u201d\n\nAreghan announced that National Identification Number (NIN) will become a major requirement for registration for the WASSCE examination with effect from the May/June 2022 WASSCE and subsequent diets, stressing \u201dno NIN, no entry.\u201d\n\nHe said the implication is that prospective candidates must register with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) and get their NIN. The HNO said the decision is in line with the Federal Government\u2019s policy, as directed by the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022It\u2019s the only way to remove him, Dickson insists\n\n\u2022I\u2019ll not resign, says party chair\n\n\u2022Senate, House caucuses support peace moves\n\n\u2022Party commences online membership registration\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAfter meeting for over 40 minutes behind closed doors on Monday, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors and the embattled National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, appeared to have reached a new deal as part of efforts to resolve the crisis which engulfed its leadership and ensure lasting peace in the main opposition party. The deal involved consideration of an early date for the party\u2019s national convention, as against the initial date of December 9.\n\nWith the new deal, widely believed to be in the overall interest of the party, THISDAY gathered that the December convention might be brought forward to either October or November.\n\nHowever, Secondus, in an earlier statement from his media office, said he would not succumb to pressure to resign. \u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign,\u201d he was quoted as saying. He added that he remained focused in his determination to move the party forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and his House of Representatives counterpart, Ndudi Elumelu, yesterday, supported the move by the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) to resolve the crisis in the party. Abaribe and Elumelu denied reports that PDP members in the House had passed a resolution that Secondus should resign. The clarification was in reaction to a statement by a House of Representatives member from Rivers State, Kingsley Chinda, asking the party chairman to resign.\n\nOn his part, a former governor of Bayelsa State and member of the upper chamber, Senator Seriake Dickson, faulted calls for Secondus to resign, saying only the national convention is empowered to remove him.\n\nThe PDP governors had met for over seven hours between 10am and 5pm at the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge. But about 4.10pm, Secondus was invited to the meeting, which held till 4.50pm\n\nAfter meeting with the PDP governors, Secondus was seen off by the governors of Sokoto and Akwa Ibom states, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and Udom Emmanuel, respectively.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that I will not resign\u201d, Secondus told reporters as he made to leave the venue.\n\nAlthough a deal to bring the convention backward had been struck, it was not clear if it included the eligibility of Secondus to contest. But the details of the deal\u2019s implementation would depend on the governors\u2019 meeting today with a committee set up by the BoT to interface.\n\nTambuwal told newsmen that the governors had resolved to back the party in its march towards greater unification.\n\nTambuwal, who is Chairman, PDP Governors Forum, said, \u201cWe have resolved to work together as a forum on the side of our party and the meeting continues tomorrow.\u201d He added, \u201cVery soon, Nigerians will know that our party is united.\u201d\n\nThe Monday meeting, held at the Akwa Ibom Liaison Office in Asokoro, Abuja, was attended by all the PDP governors, with the exception of Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau.\n\nBefore the forum adjourned, Secondus, who made a brief appearance, said he would not resign from his position.\n\nA short statement from his media office, signed by Ike Abonye, said nothing so far warranted his resignation from the party\u2019s highest position. It said a tiny minority calling for the national chairman\u2019s resignation should come clean and tell other members his offence and why he should resign. Secondus promised to remain focussed and committed to the ideals of the party, which he swore to protect and defend upon his election as chairman 44 months ago.\n\nElumelu, who spoke on behalf of the House caucus said, in a statement, \u201cThe attention of the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has been drawn to false and misleading publications, purporting that the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives met online and resolved that the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, should resign.\n\n\u201cThe publication is, indeed, embarrassing to PDP lawmakers in the House of Representatives, as no such meeting took place. For the avoidance of doubt, no online meeting or any meeting in any form whatsoever of PDP members in the House of Representatives was held, to discuss, let alone arrive at any decision regarding the national chairman or any issue related to the disagreements in the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur caucus in the House of Representatives is fully aligned with the intervention and decisions of the Board of Trustees (BoT), the elders and leaders of our party, in finding solutions to the leadership challenges confronting our great party and we await the outcome of their intervention.\n\n\u201cWhile we caution those behind this false and misleading publication to retrace their steps and desist from such, we also urge our party leaders, critical stakeholders, PDP members, teeming supporters, and the general public to completely disregard the said publication.\n\n\u201cWe call on all PDP members to remain calm and focused as the elders and leaders of the party will come out with solutions at this critical time.\u201d\n\nSupporting the House caucus position, their counterparts in the Senate also backed the steps taken by the BoT to resolve the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe Senate PDP Caucus, on Monday, stated that it was in full support of whatever steps being taken by the party\u2019s BoT to resolve the issues at stake.\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader, who doubles as Chairman of the PDP Senate Caucus, Abaribe, told THISDAY that though the PDP senators were on annual vacation, they backed the current move by the BoT to restore peace and sanity to the opposition party.\n\nAbaribe said, \u201cWe are on vacation and support the BoT effort at getting a solution.\u201d\n\nChinda and Deputy Leader, Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, had made their online resolution available to journalists yesterday, after they deliberated extensively but specifically on the current charge of \u201cinept leadership\u201d against Secondus.\n\nThey noted that while PDP and millions of Nigerians nationwide anticipated vigorous and well-coordinated issue-based national opposition, preparations towards a national convention as well as the 2023 general election, confusion, finger-pointing and needless noise around the party\u2019s national headquarters had complicated the noble objectives and lofty ideals of the PDP and democratic opposition politics in Nigeria.\n\nThey alleged that Secondus seemed content with occupying the office and preoccupied with holding on to his position rather than preparing for the next elections. This, they claimed, explained why Secondus inexplicably continued to miss endless opportunities that ought to have been utilised for consolidating a viable opposition, skewing party congresses to favour personal future ambition, and frustrating genuine party members across states, which has resulted in mass exit of party members at the National Assembly.\n\nChinda and Onyema lamented that there was no clear roadmap, blueprint or policy programme for the PDP by the chairman, thus, the party was allowed to flow with the tide, only showing up with weak press releases once in a while without commensurate sustainable action.\n\nThey expressed concern that a further three months under the leadership of Secondus could do grave harm to the party and put its members in a precarious situation.\n\nThey, therefore, urged Secondus \u201cto consider making the necessary personal sacrifice worthy of a leader in the party\u2019s current and future interest with a firm assurance of honourable regard and appreciation by the party leadership now and in years to come, by honourably resigning his position as party chairman immediately, to allow the party an early start.\u201d\n\nYesterday also, an unsigned statement by some PDP National Working Committee (NWC) members said, \u201cSequel to the meeting held on the 3rd of August 2021, at Legacy House, where members of the National Working Committee (NWC) sat and decided that a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) should be held on the 8th of August 2021 at Hilton to further deliberate on the matter bedevilling the party, the meeting held and extensively deliberated, nine members of the National Working Committee (NWC) agreed that the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has grossly mismanaged the party, highly incompetent, factionalised the party and has lost the confidence of members of the party.\n\n\u201cThe matter of his resignation was put to vote, six members voted that he should resign and three members abstained from voting. Therefore, the meeting resolved to forward the resolution taken on the 8th day of August to the governors forum, the BoT, the National Assembly caucus of both House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe call on all members of the party to remain calm as the party leadership is working tirelessly to resolve the leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cIn attendance were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif; National Secretary, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri; National Auditor, Mai Adamu Mustapha; National Financial Secretary, Abdulahi Maibasira; National Youth Leader, Hon. S.K.E. Udeh-Okoye; National Vice Chairman (SW), Taofiq Arapaja; National Vice Chairman (SE), Chief Dr. Ali Odefa; National Vice Chairman (SS), Chief Dan Osi Orbih and National vice chairman (NC), Chief Theophilus Dakas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said those who voted for the resignation of Secondus were Nazif, Adamu Udeh-Okoye, Arapaja, Orbih and Odefa.\n\nBut National Legal Adviser of PDP, Emmanuel Enoidem, disclaimed the meeting of the said members of the NWC, describing it as illegal.\n\nIn a statement, Enoidem said, \u201cI just saw the above somewhere and as a committed member of this party and by the special grace of God, a member of NWC, I have the following points to make.\n\n\u201cBy Section 29 (3) of the constitution of our party, it is the national chairman or a summon backed by 2/3 members of the NWC that can validly convene a meeting of the NWC.Subsection (4) provides for 2/3 members of NWC to form a quorum for a meeting of the NWC.\n\n\u201cAs a bona fide member of the NWC, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any meeting of the NWC summoned by the National chairman or in the manner provided aforesaid.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of grave concern, and indeed, very sad to read the above position purportedly taken by some distinguished members of NWC in utter disdain and violation of clear extant provisions of our constitution.\u201d\n\nEnoidem maintained that the power to remove any member of the NWC and, indeed, any national officer was reserved for the national convention, which was earlier slated for December 2021.\n\nSpeaking, too, Dickson, in a release issued on Monday, flayed the purported meeting by some members of the party\u2019s NWC, whom he said went outside the constitution of the party to convene a meeting in a hotel room without the knowledge, consent and presence of the national chairman. He drew the attention of PDP leaders, members as well as Nigerians to the fact that the meeting was the action of a few party officers and did not represent a valid resolution or decision of the NWC known to the PDP constitution.\n\nDickson stated, \u201cThe purported meeting and the outcome therefore are part of the plot to contrive a needless crisis in the PDP. It is part of the scheme to call a dog a bad name to hang it. The general public should note that the statement signed by some members: three members of the working committee and three vice chairmen of the party (as indicated in the press release) does not constitute a valid resolution of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the NWC has 19 members and only six of them signed the statement, leaving out the majority of 13, who were not at the meeting and the chairman, who was not aware, who did not attend, who did not authorise and who did not preside over the said meeting and therefore, it is not only a nullity but an act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is all an effort to contrive a crisis in the party to further the ulterior objective of those who are funding it, the intent of which is to cause a major crisis in the PDP.\u201d\n\nWhile puncturing a purported statement by the PDP caucus in the House, which asked Secondus to resign, Dickson said, \u201cAll this is to create a media frenzy backed up with the sponsored demonstrations at the party secretariat on Monday, which are designed to force the chairman to resign in order to set up a caretaker committee, which is illegal.\n\n\u201cHappily, the national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, has issued a statement a short while ago that he will not resign. I support this decision fully as it is backed by the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the PDP constitution, a vote of no confidence even by a duly constituted NWC or other organs of the party does not remove a Chairman. The chairman is voted for and can only be removed by the National Convention unless on his own volition, he chooses to resign.\u201d\n\nParty Commences Membership Registration\n\nMeanwhile, PDP has commenced online membership registration and revalidation in soe states. The states piloting the initiative in the first phase of the programme are Anambra, Osun, Ekiti, Edo, Adamawa, and Sokoto.\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Abuja while launching the project, Secondus stated that the \u201ccountry must at this point in time migrate from analogue to digital.\n\n\u201cData is the key to development; data is the key to proper planning and data is the way a country would be able to attract development from the global community. We as a party cannot do otherwise. We are operating in social media space, so, PDP cannot do without data.\u201d\n\nSecondus explained that by offering online registration, the party was providing Nigerians with a transparent platform to harness their democratic potential.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe project will deepen the process of membership registration and also deepen the process of democracy in attracting development. Usually, in the analogue time, they have to bring the register and if they don\u2019t like your face, you will not be a member. Some people will take the register away. All that has been eliminated.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, said the e-registration was a demonstration of PDP\u2019s readiness for the 2023 general election. Jibrin assured members that the crisis rocking the party would soon be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWe have spent so many sleepless nights in ensuring that we resolved the crisis within our party in order to make PDP great again and also take advantage of the failures of the APC,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, revealed that when the logo of the party was put online during the test-running period, in less than 24 hours, over one million Nigerians indicated interest to join the party.\n\nNational Organising Secretary, Col. Austin Akobundu (rtd), also said intensified sensitisation had commenced in order to create awareness on the e-registration programme down to the ward level.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By James Emejo\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said its proposed digital currency, known as e-Naira, will be treated as a critical national infrastructure to protect it from operational and cyber-security risks.\n\nIn a document obtained by THISDAY, which offered more insights into the digital money regime, especially the potential risks and mitigation measures, the apex bank said there would be a co-existence of traditional payment systems and the CBN Digital Currency (CBDC) to address interoperability risks that might be associated with the implementation.\n\nCBN said it would apply regulatory framework and compliance mechanisms to prevent disruptive competition for the electronic money.\n\nOn the associated cost and risk of deploying/on-boarding a new payment platform, the bank explained that medium to long- term pay-off in increased efficiency of operations was expected to offset initial outlay. It added that any risk of disintermediation would be addressed by the introduction of limits on the e-Naira holdings.\n\nThe document further stated that the introduction of the CBDC would, among other things, usher in new approaches to payment as well as bring about new bank and non- bank players in the financial system.\n\nThe digital currency regime would also introduce a new range of banking services and integration with new systems, providing new possibilities for the payment architecture.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the two-tiered model for CBDC would facilitate a public-private partnership arrangement whereby the CBN would design the e-Naira and distribute through regulated financial institutions, while the latter would in turn provide the digital cash to individuals and businesses.\n\nEssentially, under the e-Naira regime, individuals and businesses would be able to transfer value in real time through existing and future payment channels. People would also be able to transfer value in real time while offline to other persons and businesses.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the e-Naira would lower the cost of operations and cash management as well as improve visibility and insight of transaction date for financial institutions. It would also improve opportunities in the financial system, creating new business opportunities from emerging business models, financial products, and services.\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele had during the recent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting provided additional clarification on the e-Naira project. Emefiele said if \u201cyou have some naira in your account and you choose to convert part of your naira into a digital wallet by way of a digital currency, we will support that.\n\n\u201cIf, for instance, you have N10 million in your account. Of course, when this starts, the CBN will move some of the balances of banks with CBN to those banks in digital currency. So, you go to your bank, you have N10 million and you say you want to convert N2 million out of your N10 million into a digital currency. They will debit your account and move it to your wallet of N2 million digital currency, which you can spend across countries.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe think that this is a noble idea and we are not the first\u2026many other central banks are at advanced stages of revealing their own digital currencies. And our own digital currency, which is tagged e-Naira, will certainly come into operation, by the special grace of God, by October and we are working very hard for this.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said, \u201cWe believe that transactions will be cheaper and more efficient, as there will be less to complete.\u201d\n\nHe said as Nigeria moved to the digital economy, like the rest of the world, cash would not play in that space.\n\n\u201cTherefore, e-Naira, which will represent the digital equivalent of cash, will be used as the fiat currency to effect transactions,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of financial inclusion, we believe that with over 30 per cent of bankable adults still outside the financial system, the ability to have offline payment through our e-Naira initiative will bring\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Rivers Govt, Not FG Should Collect VAT, Related Taxes, Court Rules",
          "text": "By Blessing Ibunge\n\nIn a landmark ruling, the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has declared that the Rivers State Government and not the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), an agency of the federal government, should collect Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in the state.\n\nPresided over by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam, the court also issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining the FIRS and the Attorney General of the federation, both first and second defendants in the suit, from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS, personnel income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nJustice Pam made the assertion while delivering judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant).\n\nThe Court, which granted all the eleven reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, stated that there was no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand for and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology levy in Rivers State or any other State of the Federation, being that the constitutional powers and competence of the federal government was limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains, which did not include VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the defendants that the Court lackedjurisdiction to hear the suit and that the case should be transferred to Court of Appeal for interpretation.\n\nJustice Pam, who also dismissed objection raised by the defendants that the National Assembly ought to have been made a party in the suit, declared that the issues of taxes raised by the state government were issues of law that the court was constitutionally empowered to entertain.\n\nHe declared that after a diligent review of the issues raised by both the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff has proven beyond doubt that it was entitled to all the eleven reliefs it sought in the suit.\n\nThe court agreed with the Rivers State Government that it was the State and not FIRS that was constitutionally entitled to impose taxes enforceable or collectable in its territory of the nature of consumption or sales tax, VAT, education and other taxes or levies, other than the taxes and duties specifically reserved for the federal government by items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nAlso, the court declared that the defendants were not constitutionally entitled to charge or impose levies, charges or rates (under any guise or by whatever name called) on the residents of Rivers State and indeed any state of the federation.\n\nAmong the reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, was a declaration that the constitutional power of the federal government to impose taxes and duties was only limited to the items listed in items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the second schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nThe Rivers State Government had also urged the court to declare that, by virtue of the provisions of items 7 and 8 of the Part II (Concurrent Legislative List) of the Second Schedule of the constitution, the power of the federal government to delegate the collection of taxes can only be exercised by the State government or other authority of the state and no other person.\n\nThe State government had further asked the court to declare that all statutory provisions made or purportedly made in the exercise of the legislative powers of the federal government, which contained provisions that were inconsistent with or in excess of the powers to impose tax and duties, as prescribed by items 58 and 59 of the Part I of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution, or inconsistent with the power to delegate the duty of collection of taxes, as contained in items 7 and 8 of Part II of the Second Schedule of the Constitution, were unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nLead counsel for the Rivers State Government, Donald Chika Denwigwe (SAN), who spoke to journalists after the court session, explained that the case was all about the interpretation of the constitution as regards the authority of the government at the state and federal levels to collect certain revenue particularly, VAT.\n\n\u201cSo, during the determination of the matter, some issues of law were thrown up like, whether or not the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for the determination of some issues.\n\n\u201cThe court noted that the application is like asking the Federal High Court to transfer the entire case to the Court of Appeal. In which case, if the court so decides, there will be nothing left to refer back to the Federal High Court as required by the constitution.\u201d\n\nAccording to Denwigwe, the court refused that prayer and decided that the case was in its proper place before the Federal High Court and to determine it.\n\nDonald Chika Denwigwe, SAN, lead counsel to Government of Rivers State and Ken C.O. Njemanze, SAN, briefing journalists after the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt on Monday declared FIRS collection of Value Added Tax in Rivers State unconstitutional.\n\nOn the implication of the judgement, Denwigwe said it was now, unlawful for such taxes as VAT in Rivers State to be collected by any agency of the federal government.\n\n\u201cIn a summary, it is a determination that it is wrong for the federal government to be collecting taxes, which are constitutionally reserved for the state governments to collect. The implication of the judgement is that the government (federal and state) as an authority under the constitution, should be advised by the judgement, that it is the duty of all government authorities to comply with and obey the law so long as the court has interpreted it and said what that law is.\n\n\u201cSo, in other words, the issue of Value Added Tax (VAT) in the territory of Rivers State and Personal Income Tax should be reserved for the government of Rivers State.\u201d\n\nCounsel to FIRS, O.C. Eyibo said he would study the judgment and advise his client.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The family of Usifo Ataga, the late Super TV CEO have accused the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu of complicity in an alleged attempt to protect his killers.\n\nThe prosecution of Chidinma Ojukwu, the 21-year-old prime suspect in the murder case of the Super TV CEO has commenced and the family are afraid one of the killers has been granted bail already.\n\nThe family revealed that one Babalola Disu who was arraigned for allegedly preventing the police from performing their duties is \u201chighly suspected to have carried out the murder.\u201d\n\nTheir suspicion is premised on the information they have that Disu's apartment was opposite Usifo\u2019s in the short rental apartment where the latter was killed.\n\nThey also said they were shocked to hear that Chidinma was arraigned in court, saying they were not informed by the police before the arraignment of the prime suspect. See Also Legal Police Took Murder Suspect, Chidinma Away Without Handcuffs In Uber Ride\u2014Late Super TV Boss' Family\n\nAccording to them, Chidinma was reportedly moved to the prison from court without handcuffs in an Uber ride.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked to read from the media that she was arraigned in court. The Lagos State Police Command didn\u2019t inform us at all,\u201d a family source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe other defendants, including the man claiming to be Chidinma\u2019s father wasn\u2019t her father but her sugar daddy. So the police lied about that.\n\n\u201cWe were also shocked that Chidinma reportedly left the court premises without handcuffs in an Uber ride.\n\n\u201cOne Disu who was granted bail to the tune of N1m is highly suspected to have carried out the murder. His apartment was opposite Usifo\u2019s in the short rental apartment.\n\n\u201cAnd he reportedly asked that carpenter of Airbnb (Air Bed and Breakfast) should be called to fix his door, only to be told it was Usifo\u2019s door that was broken.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Police Commissioner is also complicit in bungling this case, we don\u2019t really understand him.\u201d\n\nChidinma, a 21-year-old Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos, was arrested by the police on June 23, 2021.\n\nShe was said to have been in a romantic relationship with 50-year-old Usifo for about four months before the incident.\n\nUsifo was found dead with multiple stab wounds on June 16 at an apartment on Adebowale Oshin Street, Lekki Phase I where he had checked in with Chidinma.\n\nShe was consequently arrested on June 23 in Yaba and paraded at the Lagos State Police Command headquarters in Ikeja.\n\nShe confessed to stabbing Usifo with a knife under the influence of alcohol and withdrawing N380,000 from the victim\u2019s account with his ATM card. She, however, backtracked later in a video, claiming she acted in self defence.\n\nUsifo was buried on July 30 in a low-key ceremony attended by his family members, including his wife, and friends.\n\nThe police had also filed a criminal charge against Mr Onoh Ojukwu, father of Chidinma, and four others.

I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 months ago, Africa-focused eCommerce giant, Jumia, changed its business strategy to something it deemed more effective. A focus on low-value/high-value products, and a drastic reduction in marketing expense helped it reduce losses significantly for up to six quarters.\n\nConversely, reduced marketing seemingly stunted Jumia\u2019s growth as its user base and the number of orders on its platform kept fluctuating. While its gross profit margins seemingly increased YoY, there was inconsistent growth on a quarterly basis.\n\nLet\u2019s paint a quick picture:\n\nIn one year, the company only added 500,000 active users \u2013 people who placed orders, irrespective of cancellations or returns. Nine months before this change in strategy, Jumia added 1.3 million active users year-on-year (YoY) on average.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese numbers and investor sentiments which quickly moved from bullish to bearish led us to question the effectiveness of Jumia\u2019s push towards profitability.\n\nPer its Q2 2020 report released today, August 8, 2021, Jumia appears to have made a slight tweak to its growth strategy, spending a whopping $17.1 million on sales and advertising.\n\nNote: Jumia has historically used the Euros to report its financials, but it has stated that it will be using the US dollar going forward. Consequently, the numbers for previous reports have been modified\n\nJeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Jumia stated that in the past 18 months, the company has significantly diversified its product categories, improved unit economics, and strengthened its balance sheet. It plans to build on this by increasing sales and advertising investments while increasing gross profits.\n\n\u201cWhile we start to see early signs of usage acceleration, these investments are long term in nature and we expect them to pay out over time, as we continue to execute on our strategy,\u201d both CEOs proffered.\n\nThe plan, for them, is to make Jumia a part of their customer\u2019s everyday lives by engaging both buyers and sellers in the variety of services it offers.\n\nThe company reveals that customer targeting on Facebook and Google has been a big part of its campaign, and it plans to leverage geotargeting tools for outdoor advertising, as well as various customer incentives.\n\nThe result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Jumia added up to 200,000 active customers YoY to reach 7 million, this is just 100,000 more than the 6.9 million customers it had in Q1 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Jumia\u2019s aggressive marketing helped drive several orders on its platform. Orders \u2013 items ordered irrespective of returns and cancellations \u2014 increased 12.8% from last year to 7.6 million. This is 1 million orders more than it processed in Q1 2021.\n\nWhile phones and electronics have continued to decline, and FMCGs are not growing as fast, Jumia has witnessed explosive growth in food delivery.\n\n\u201cFood delivery posted the highest ever number of quarterly orders, up almost 60% year-over-year and accounting for 22% of total orders on our platform during the quarter.\n\nJumia reveals that it focused its growth efforts in this segment late last year after the disruption experienced at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) declined 11% from $253 million last year to $223.5 million. Still, this is a marked improvement from $200 million in Q1 2021.\n\nJumia also cites Foreign Exchange activities such as an increase in currency valuations for Ivory Coast, South Africa, and Morocco, against the US Dollar as a key driver for GMV performance.\n\nConsumer electronics and gadgets accounted for 37% of Jumia\u2019s GMV, while groceries accounted for 14%. JumiaPay, its much-vaunted digital financial services platform, was the GMV\u2019s increased its GMV contribution to 25%.\n\nJumiaPay transactions grew by 12% from 2.4 million last year to 2.7 million in Q2 2021. However, total payment volume reduced from $59 million to $56 million.\n\nEncouragingly, Jumia\u2019s gross profit after fulfillment expense (picking, packing, and shipping costs) increased 16% from $6.6 million to 7.7 million YoY. In Q1 2021 it recorded a $7.5 gross profit after fulfillment.\n\nLosses have increased once again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn exchange for a slight increase in customer base, gross profit, and increased orders on the platform, Jumia\u2019s losses have risen significantly.\n\nThe company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss increased by 15% from $36.2 million in Q2 2020 to $41.6 million in Q2 2021.\n\nWhen Taxes, Interests, and other parameters are accounted for, Jumia was left with an operating loss of $51.6 million in Q2 2021, up 24.7% from the same period last year.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Jumia attributes these significant losses to increased sales and advertising expenses.\n\n\u201cAt the end of June 30, 2021, we had $637.7 million of cash on our balance sheet. Cash used in operating and investing activities was $27.4 million,\u201d the company reports.\n\nWhat does the future look like?\n\n\u201cIn the second half of 2021, we expect to increase our investments in Sales and Advertising, Technology and staff costs expenses as compared to the second half of 2020.\u201d Jumia states.\n\nRecall that in the six months leading to March 2021, Jumia sold off $570 million worth of shares in order to raise extra cash. While we initially stated that the implications were not obvious, such a runaway might be necessary for a period of significant losses that might follow an aggressive marketing period.\n\nWhile both CEOs aver that this will drive long-term growth, it is worth noting that this is not a new strategy, and Jumia has always employed this before toning things down 18 months ago.\n\nIs this sustainable? It might be too soon to say, but we\u2019ll likely see Jumia adjust its strategy in a few months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the first detection of the coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has reached pandemic proportions, affecting students and schooling at all levels.\n\nIn a March 2021 press release, the United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) claimed that the temporary closure of educational institutions affected over 168 million children worldwide who stayed home as countries worked to flatten the curve.\n\nConsequently, schools transited to online learning.\n\nInternational human rights organisation, Amnesty International, reported that students were cut off from schools when the COVID-19 pandemic hit South Africa, leaving hundreds and thousands of students without access to education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Africa has a 62% Internet penetration rate, which translates to 36.54 million Internet users with a 3.1% year-on-year (YoY) increase as of 2020. And WhatsApp is the country\u2019s most popular social media platform.\n\nAccording to a social media report (PDF) by Global Wellbeing Index (GWI), 96% of South African Internet users use WhatsApp. Responding to the growing number of users, Dacod Magagula (CEO) and Tao Boyle (COO) founded FoondaMate, a WhatsApp API.\n\nStudents use FoondaMate to download research papers, search concepts, define words, and do simple mathematical calculations.\n\n\u201cWe launched FoondaMate in South Africa in August 2020 after realising that hundreds of thousands of students in our country were unable to learn because schools were closed due to lockdowns and the unavailability of appropriate technology products,\u201d Boyle explains.\n\n\u201cSo, we developed a method for students to study online using WhatsApp,\u201d Magagula adds.\n\nWhy FoondaMate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoondaMate co-founders from L-R: (Tao Boyle, Dacod Magagula); Source: Supplied\n\nGrowing up outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, South Africa, Magagula says he was the only student in his high school class with access to a computer. His visits to local Internet cafes to download study material significantly impacted his life. He was the first student from his school to get into the University of Cape Town.\n\n\u201cPartly, this success can be attributed to the availability of resources I was exposed to,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, that was not the case for his co-founder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyle attended a private high school in Cape Town with computers, but she faced education inequality in her third year at the University of Cape Town.\n\n\u201cI first encountered the issue of educational inequality during my third-year internship at Funda Wande, an NGO,\u201d she begins.\n\nHer internship assignment required her to collect data on textbook spending in South Africa. This proved to be a turning point for her.\n\n\u201cThis experience really got me thinking about scalable ways to address education inequality,\u201d she adds.\n\nBoyle got to know Magagula through a friend. They conversed about educational inequality, and their exchanges resulted in the creation of FoondaMate.\n\n\u201cMy co-founder and I met at the university, and the stark differences in our high school experience were a huge eye-opener for me,\u201d Boyle reveals.\n\n\u201cI always wished I could share resources with more students in the community. Therefore, when WhatsApp opened its API in 2020, my co-founder and I realised that my wish could become a reality. And there we started FoondaMate,\u201d Magagula says.\n\nUsing FoondaMate on WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOO, Tao Boyle; Source: Supplied\n\nThe name, FoondaMate is derived from siSwati, and translates to \u201cstudy buddy.\u201d Describing the WhatsApp API, Boyle says it\u2019s like \u201cmessaging a very knowledgeable friend.\u201d\n\nFoondaMate helps students with limited Internet access to study online using localised chatbots.\n\nTo access study materials, search the web, or download practice questions and memos, click this link, and you\u2019ll see a WhatsApp web-like interface on your screen asking you to send \u2018hello\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the green \u201cGo to Chat\u201d button and click on \u201cOpen WhatsApp\u201d if you have WhatsApp installed on your device. You will be redirected to chat with Nelson, a chatbot.\n\nFoondaMate wants students to succeed irrespective of the resources available in their schools or homes. They believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not.\n\nThe edtech startup plans to change this by making opportunities available to everyone by using a platform most students with a smartphone already have.\n\nConsidering the cost of traditional educational materials like textbooks and group tutoring in South Africa, FoondaMate helps save costs by offering those services on WhatsApp.\n\nSome students with limited internal memory on their smartphones can\u2019t download the apps that give them access to online resources. So FoondaMate uses WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger already installed on users\u2019 phones to help them study.\n\nStriking growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO, Dacod Magagula; Source: Supplied\n\nSpeaking about their growth, Boyle says, \u201cWe have seen a 64% increase in signups month-on-month from May to June 2021, a 66% increase in Monthly Active Users (MAU) month-on-month from May to June 2021, and we just hit 138,870 signups for FoondaMate, which is a pre-revenue with initial pilot revenue to prove our business model.\u201d\n\nFoondaMate also generates revenue through collaborations with financial institutions and post-secondary educational institutions. Partnering with financial institutions helps provide users with sponsored information on financial literacy while promoting its partners\u2019 relevant product offerings.\n\nThis helps users, many of whom are underprivileged, develop critical financial literacy skills while also expanding market opportunities for partners.\n\n\u201cFor post-secondary educational institutions, we facilitate applications via FoondaMate, enabling them to increase the number of applicants to their programmes,\u201d Boyle says.\n\nHere, the critical value is their ability to connect these educational institutions with brilliant and engaged students who, otherwise, might not know about the institutions\u2019 programmes.\n\nFrom South Africa to the World\n\nLike the Kenyan edtech startup, M-Lugha, helping Kenyans learn in their native language, FoondaMate engages its users in their indigenous languages.\n\nBoyle says, \u201cmaking resources available in native languages creates a unique form of user delight that affirms its users while providing them with access to education.\u201d\n\nFoondaMate is available in ten African languages. However, they are faced with a challenge.\n\n\u201cBuilding FoondaMate is challenging because we are not only building a technology but also introducing it to communities,\u201d Boyle says.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty tricky because the majority of their users have never interacted with a chatbot before. So, ensuring that users understand they are not chatting with a human is tough.\n\n\u201cWe had users who wanted to become friends with Nelson, the chatbot, asking to meet up or have phone calls. That indeed is a challenge,\u201d Magaluga reveals.\n\n\u201cWe have had to change our approach to make sure students actually understand that they are interacting with a bot so that they are not disappointed when they can\u2019t hang out with their new friend,\u201d Boyle expounds.\n\nHowever, the edtech startup has recorded massive success since its launch in August 2020.\n\nFoondaMate has reached over 130,000 students within Africa, Latin America, and Asia, who have downloaded over 1.8 million practice questions.\n\nAlthough these questions are the same across all countries, the team is working on making them region-specific.\n\nThough most users are from South Africa, people in other African countries like Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, Nigeria, Malawi, and Kenya also use FoondaMate.\n\nIn Latin American, FoondaMate\u2019s users come from Colombia and Brazil, while users in Asia are from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.

We are doing enumeration and biometric data capturing of the pupils enrolled under the programme, getting feedbacks from cooks and head-teachers within the programme.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep an up-to-date record of the programme and make it more responsive as well as meet the beneficiaries to get real-time feedback from them as well.\n\n\u201cThe current enumeration and bio-data capturing is a building block towards the expansion of the programme to include more pupils and schools in the state.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari had earlier announced his laudable intention of an additional 5 million pupils to be enrolled in the programme nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe ministry also wants to know how the programme is being managed on daily basis, the resources available and if there are shortfalls before the expansion would be done in order to tighten loose ends,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister said that the programme, which started on Feb. 8, 2017, in the state, had pushed up enrollment figures in public schools and increased the daily attendance to school.\n\n\u201cThe programme has helped in the concentration of the pupils during classes since some of them do not feed or are underfed at home before coming to school each day,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nFarouq said that currently, the programme is having 9,196,823 pupils nationwide, with a total of 107,000 cooks supplying the food, which is indigenous and home-made for the pupils nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe programme has a lot of multiplier effects. It has assisted farmers to expand food production and employ more hands in the farms as well as the cooks also employing more hands to assist them,\u2019\u2019 she noted.\n\nSpeaking, the Headmistress of the primary school, Mrs Salome Obi, said that the pupils were \u2018very happy\u2019 to be part of the programme, adding that apart from increasing enrollment, \u201cit has helped in pupils\u2019 retention ability\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter eating the meals each day, you see the pupils enlivened and eager to continue with their learning rather than feeling dull or hungry,\u2019\u2019 Obi said.\n\nA cook in the programme, Mrs Uzoamaka Ogbu, thanked the Federal Government for engaging her and other women in the programme, which had helped to improve the welfare of their families and other dependents.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we are having is the issue of non-regular payment and the current cost of food stuff in the market, which the N70 per meal (with a fruit) remained inadequate with market realities,\u2019\u2019 Ogbu said.\n\nA pupil, Miss Flavour Anigbo, prayed God to bless and protect President Buhari for providing food for her and her classmates.\n\n\u201cThe feeding makes us happy each day in school. We want them to keep it up and God to bless President Muhammadu Buhari for us,\u2019\u2019 Anigbo said.\n\nThe ministry monitoring and enumerating team later went to a primary school complex within Idaw River area in Enugu South Local Government with five primary schools.\n\n...",

The PDP Stakeholders held a meeting on Tuesday 10th August, 2021, at Wadata Plaza, Abuja on the recent developments in the PDP.\n\n2. There were extensive consultations with all major stakeholders in the Party including the Governors, members of the Board of Trustees, former Presiding Officers and current Principal officers and Leaders from the National Assembly, former Governors, former Ministers, and indeed other leaders of the Party with a view to bringing all tendencies within the Party together in view of the urgent task facing the Party as the only viable vehicle to checkmate the abysmally poor governance of the APC led Federal Government.\n\n3. The meeting deliberated extensively on the issues thrown up and resolved as follows:\n\na. That the Constitution, traditions and practices of the Party should be strictly adhered to in finding solutions to any problems.\n\nb. That all parties should sheath their sword in the greater interest of the PDP and the need to RESCUE Nigeria from the avoidable National malaise and drift occasioned by the APC administration.\n\nc. That all processes leading to an early National Convention in October be immediately activated by relevant Party organs, especially National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nd. That the Party should redouble efforts to provide a credible alternative leadership for Nigeria as it still remains the only hope for the Nigerian people for good governance.\n\ne. The meeting requested the NEC to immediately constitute a Zoning Committee for Party Offices and another Committee for National Elective Offices.\n\nf. The meeting expressed appreciation to Party elders for their commitment and wisdom in handling Party affairs.\n\ng.

          "text": "Former Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha has described as absurd, an order of Imo State High Court for permanent forfeiture of properties belonging to him, noting that the judge couldn\u2019t have delivered judgment in a case he never heard.\n\nRecall that a state High Court in Owerri, earlier today ordered the final and absolute forfeiture of Royal Palm Springs Hotel and other properties said to belong to Okorocha and other members of his family.\n\nThe forfeited properties are contained in pages 226 to 272 of the Imo state Government white paper report by a Judicial Commission of Enquiry on Recovery of Lands and other related matters.\n\nAccording to the ruling by Justice Fred Njemanze, who was sitting as a vacation judge, Okorocha\u2019s counsel failed to give concrete and verifiable reasons why a final and absolute forfeiture order should not be given in favour of the Imo state government.\n\nJustice Njemanze had added that the suit filed against Imo state Government by Okorocha\u2019s counsel was not properly filed.\n\nHe also described it as a surplusage, a term in law which means a useless statement completely irrelevant to a matter.\n\nJustice Njemanze maintained that the white paper gazette by the Imo state Government is a legal binding document, concluding that there was no concrete reason before it why the forfeiture should not be made absolute and final, hence the Imo state Government can go ahead and do whatever it deems fit to do with the properties.\n\nAs for persons who might have made purchase on such properties, Justice Njamanze said they are at liberty to approach the court to prove their titles.\n\nHowever, reacting to the judgment in a statement by his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha said the judgement is a miscarriage of justice.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018Justice Fred Njemanze of High Court Owerri gave judgement in a matter he never heard, less than 24 hours to his retirement today, August 10, 2021,\u201d Okorocha said the judge gave the judgement as a parting gift to the state government.\n\nHe vowed to approach relevant agencies \u201cto investigate the judgement and prove him or us right or wrong.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cOn Tuesday, August 3, 2021, Justice Njemanze sat. The lawyers in the matter argued on the preliminary objection. Chief Obah Maduabuchi, SAN, was Okorocha\u2019s Lawyer and Chief Louis Alozie (SAN) was for the Imo State Government.\n\n\u201cJustice Njemanze reserved ruling on the Preliminary objection and told the lawyers that they would be Communicated on the date. He also told other lawyers who had applied to be joined for their clients, to wait until after the ruling on the preliminary objection.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, August 4, 2021, the Court Clerk sent text messages to the lawyers that the Court would sit on Friday, August 6, 2021 for the lawyers to adopt their processes, instead of the expected ruling on the Preliminary objection.\n\n\u201cOn the Friday, August 6, 2021, Lawyers were in Court. Justice Njemanze did not come. He did not sit that day. Lawyers left and those involved left.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, on the Friday, August 6, 2021, neither the expected ruling on the Preliminary objection was given, nor the adoption of the processes as Contained in the text messages of Wednesday, August 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, August 9, 2021, while lawyers in the matter were expecting to hear from the Court on the issue of date, the news came that Justice Njemanze had given Judgement in a substantive suit he never heard and not also on the Preliminary objection, even when lawyers had not adopted their processes.\n\n\u201cIn the Contentious forfeiture Order Justice Njemanze gave on February 24, 2021, only five properties were directly linked to Okorocha and family, including Eastern Palm University and Royal Spring Palm hotel.\n\n\u201cBut, both Justice Njemanze and the Imo State government had talked about pages 226 to 272 of the aberration called the WHITEPAPER, as Containing Okorocha\u2019s Properties. This is bare blackmail. It is not true.\n\n\u201cWe have meticulously gone through pages 226 to 272 of their WHITEPAPER. The pages contained layouts and estates and none belonged to Okorocha and the family.\n\n\u201cSome of those who own these properties in the interim forfeiture order are also in various courts and like we said, some of them had also applied to Justice Njemanze to be joined. But Justice Njemanze told them to wait until he ruled on the preliminary objection. But he went ahead to give Judgement in the substantive matter he never heard. This is absurd.\n\n\u201cIn the Contentious Judgement, he gave absolute forfeiture order on the properties in question, in a matter he never heard and which matters on them, have been going on in Courts of Competent Jurisdiction. And in less than 24 hours to his retirement today being Tuesday, August 10, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we are hearing that a Judge could give Judgement in a matter or case he never heard. This is not good for the Society and for the judicial system.\u201d",

Violence is not to be celebrated in any way at all. We have always urged them (IPOB) to thread on the side of caution because we believe that dialogue and deliberations are better ways of achieving results,\u201d he said.\n\nOgbonnia told Punch that shutting down the socio-economic activities of the region was not the best way for IPOB to show support for Kanu.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze\u2019s position is that it should not continue. It is not necessary destroying the socio-economic activities of the South-East. There are other ways of expressing support for Nnamdi Kanu short of shutting down the socio-economic activities of the Southeast,\u201d Punch quoted him as saying.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that people from Cameroon, people from other parts of Nigeria are in the South-East for commercial purposes. This disruption is not good for the development of the South-East, it is adding hardship to the people.\n\n\u201cEven yesterday (Monday), many people didn\u2019t take the NECO examination because of the sit-at-home order.

Another 146 people at risk were also identified, Dr. Krutika Kuppalli told BBC News.\n\nLike Ebola virus, Marburg is a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease that initially spreads to humans through fruit bats. Once infected, humans can spread the virus to other people through bodily fluids and via contaminated surfaces.\n\nSymptoms of the virus include headache, fever, muscle pains, bleeding and vomiting blood, the WHO says. The disease is severe, untreatable and ultimately kills approximately half of the people it infects. Doctors say the best way to deal with it is to treat the symptoms and give patients lots of water.\n\nThe disease remains very rare and hard to recognize, as the symptoms resemble malaria, typhoid and other hemorrhagic fevers.\n\nThe virus was first identified in 1967, when simultaneous outbreaks occurred in Belgrade, Serbia and the German cities of Frankfurt and Marburg. Those outbreaks were linked to lab monkeys that had been imported from Uganda.\n\nSince then, health officials have recorded handfuls of cases and a few outbreaks in Uganda, Kenya, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo over the years.\n\nThe worst outbreak occurred in 2005, when 374 people were infected in Angola. Of those 374 infected, 329 people died",

          "text": "In furtherance of its New Vision development agenda for the Niger Delta, the Buhari administration will ensure the completion of the critical projects it has embarked upon in the region, says Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN).\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Tuesday at the 6th anniversary lecture/Niger Delta Awards organised by Gbaramatu Voice Newspaper, which held in Lagos.\n\nThe VP who was represented at the event by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs in the Office of the Vice President, Mr. Edobor Iyamu.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him in a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, \u201cin 2017, following my tour of the Niger Delta, which involved extensive consultations with key stakeholders in the region, the New Vision for the Niger Delta was birthed in response to the various challenges which had been plaguing our people.\n\n\u201cThe objective of this New Vision is to ensure that the people of the region benefit maximally from their wealth, through promoting infrastructural developments, environmental remediation and local content development.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said that the administration\u2019s Niger Delta New Vision initiative has recorded some landmark achievements in the areas of education, environmental remediation, infrastructure and local content development, among others.\n\nHe added that, \u201cas part of the quest to expand economic opportunities in the region, this administration has promoted investments in modular refineries. The objective of this initiative is to address our present energy demands and empower the Niger Delta people through promoting local content.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President stated that while there were several modular refineries at different stages of completion across the region, three have been other completed projects including the Niger Delta Petroleum Resources (NDPR) Modular Refinery in Rivers State; OPAC Modular Refinery in Delta State, and Walter Smith Modular Refinery in Imo State.\n\nHe also noted the ongoing remediation exercise in Ogoni land, Rivers State, which was kick-started by the Buhari administration under the recommendations of UNEP.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cIt is important to note that the Ogoni clean-up is the first of its kind in the history of the Niger Delta. Indeed, this is the first time the Federal Government is directly involved in remediation activities within the region.\n\n\u201cWe are equally committed to expanding infrastructure in the region, this includes the ongoing construction work on the 34-kilometers Bonny-Bodo Road/Bridge, which has been abandoned for decades. When completed, the project, which was flagged off in October 2017, would connect several major communities and boost socio-economic development in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Itakpe-Ajaokuta-Warri Rail Line project, which was commissioned by Mr. President in September 2020, and has the capacity to handle both passengers and freight services, is connecting several communities and promoting commerce within the region.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is also developing a number of deep sea ports across the region, including the Bonny, Warri, and Ibom Deep Sea Ports, among other development projects such as the establishment of Export Processing Zones to boost economic activities.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the National Universities Commission (NUC) approved the commencement of undergraduate degree programmes at the Nigerian Maritime University in Okerenkoko, Delta State, which happens to be situated in the great Gbaramatu Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President further noted that, \u201cbeyond its oil wealth, the Niger Delta region is incredibly blessed with diverse human capital across education, sports, technology, creative arts, entertainment, economy, and many other sectors.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the event, \u201cThe Dwindling State of Crude Oil Demand in the Global Market: The Way Forward\u201d, the Vice President stated that factors such as the attendant decline in demand for crude oil, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global energy demand and on government\u2019s earning and the current situation, require creative and holistic approach to foster economic growth.\n\nNoting that despite the fact that crude oil accounts for about 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, the VP stated that the Federal Government from inception had shown a commitment towards the creation of economic opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s population in a post-oil future.\n\nThe Vice President highlighted initiatives being taken by the Federal Government to reposition Nigeria\u2019s economy by taking advantage of global trends in the energy sector.\n\nThese include the SolarPowerNaija Programme under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) which will complement efforts towards providing affordable electricity access to five million households, serving about 25 million Nigerians in rural areas and under-served urban communities nationwide.\n\nThe VP also highlighted efforts by the Federal Government on energy transition from crude oil to natural gas, as well as its National Gas Expansion Programme, also a component under the ESP.\n\nHe said, \u201cas part of our drive to encourage investments in gas production and optimize our nation\u2019s enormous gas potential, the Federal Government declared the period of 2020-2030 as the decade of gas. To this end, last November, the Federal Government launched its National Gas Expansion Programme, which focuses on the distribution of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) across gas stations operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\n\u201cBy the end of this year, this administration will commence distribution of CNG as part of our strategy to gradually replace the high sulfur petrol. Our objective is two-fold. First, this is the administration\u2019s effort at managing the necessary energy transition from crude oil to natural gas. We intend to increase our domestic gas supply to meet this demand by exploiting our abundant reserves of natural gas.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we are aiming to develop CNG into an alternative automobile fuel as a means of affording Nigerians cheaper, cleaner and additional fuel. In this way, we will reduce the ecological and economic costs of energy. The Gas Masterplan provides for investment in the necessary infrastructure for gas transportation across the nation. All of these will basically reduce our local crude oil dependency, whilst strengthening our drive for cleaner sources of energy as a nation. And crucially, it will create jobs in what will be a fast-expanding frontier of opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn line with the administration\u2019s New Vision for the Niger Delta initiative to develop the region, the Vice President noted that the Federal Government has \u201calso invested significantly in the Niger Delta as the region that holds the energy resources that have powered our progress for six decades as well as the keys to an emergent gas economy.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President further noted that the Administration places top priority on peace and security in the region.\n\n\u201cIn terms of addressing concerns around public safety and social security in the region, while ensuring peace and stability in the region, the administration has, among other things, sustained its commitment to the Presidential Amnesty Programme under which youths and ex-agitators are engaged in formal education, vocational skills acquisition and empowerment programmes that offer a pathway towards productive and dignified livelihoods,\u201d he said.\n\nCommending the publishers of Gbaramatu Voice Newspapers for organising the event, the Vice President added the \u201ccumulative effect of all these measures will have a positive transformational impact on the Niger Delta and on the future of our nation as a whole while ensuring sustainable peace and progress in the Niger Delta.\u201d",

And that NEC would be convened by the Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus who is constitutionally empowered to do so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2026Blasts APC\n\nEarlier in his remarks before going into meeting proper, Tambuwal said, \u201cwe are committed to remaining in PDP. Disregard any rumour, every rumour that any of these distinguished leaders are going anywhere. We are in PDP, we are going to remain in PDP and by the grace of God, we shall be working together to salvage Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you say you\u2019re going somewhere where? APC is no party. They do not have a ward structure as we speak. They do not have a local government structure as we speak. They do not have state structures as we speak. They do not have a national structure as we speak. APC has never had, and is not having a Board of Trustees.\n\n\u201cSo, where are you going? Are you defecting to the federal government? The federal government is not there because if it is there, ask my colleagues who are in APC; one of them came out to say that when his students were abducted that he saw no help. He received no help from the federal government, and he is a governor of APC. So what are we talking about?\n\n\u201cThere is no party to defect to; there is no government to defect to. We better remain together and work together, reinvent our party, and work towards the establishment of government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nBoT chair, Secondus call for unity\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman PDP BoT Senator Walid Jibrin urged major stakeholders and members of the party to shun personal interest and give way for permanent peace in the party.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is only when there is peace in our party we can talk about winning the election. APC has failed Nigerians and most citizens are waiting for the PDP.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the party\u2019s national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus called for peace and unity within the PDP.\n\n\u201cThis party will continue to remain in peace and unity.

          "title": "Interrogating diplomacy as a tool to dismantle insurgency in West Africa -NigPilot",
          "text": "The idea that wars, conventional or otherwise more often than not, end on a table of discussion other than the battlefield cannot be farther from the truth.\n\nHowever, this narrative of discussion or negotiation is multilayered. It could be a negotiation between the government and rebels or terrorists, depending on the scenario. Or between the government and superpowers who control the arms sales.\n\nIn West Africa, for example, no member nation is advanced in manufacturing military hardware, and these wars are fought with modern weaponry. To this end, all the nations in the sub-region are dependent on the superpowers for their supply of the latest military weapons, the same way the non-state actors are also relying on these same manufacturers to stock their arsenal.\n\nUnfortunately, there are instances where nations are denied access to the arms market to tackle terrorism or insurgency in their countries on account of human right violation by state forces.\n\nThis is even when these criminal elements have unrestricted access to some of this modern weaponry though through unconventional methods or what is popularly known as black market or back door channel.\n\nTo prevent a scenario where nations are denied access to the needed military hardware to suffocate these terrorists under the guise of human rights abuses, diplomatic negotiation becomes imperative.\n\nIt is, nonetheless, on the premise of the foregoing that serving and retired foreign relations practitioners under the aegis of Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria (AFRPN) chose \u201cThe Role of Diplomacy in Combating Terrorism and Insurgency in West Africa,\u201d as the topic for its 2021 annual lecture/conference.\n\nDelivering the lecture in Abuja, Africa\u2019s famous diplomat and immediate past Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Dr. Mohammed Ibn Chambas tasked the ECOWAS Member States to as a matter of tactics look beyond the surface in tackling terrorism, insurgency, and banditry in their domains.\n\nHe said that member states need a renewed commitment to look beyond terrorism as a tactic and address the underlying conditions and drivers that enable it to sustain and spread.\n\nDr. Chambas who was the Guest Lecturer also noted that while nothing can justify violent extremism, it does not exist in a vacuum.\n\n\u201cAs stated in the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, \u2018narrative of grievance, actually perceived injustice, promised empowerment and sweeping changes become attractive where human rights are being violated, good governance is being ignored and aspirations are being crushed\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe use of diplomacy as a counter-terrorism effort must therefore include efficient and effective negotiations skills that do not solely focus on forcing conflicting parties into accepting and signing peace packs. Enhancing sustained peace and conflict resolutions aimed at combating terrorism and insurgency through diplomacy is therefore improved when the negotiations\u2019 table provides the ground for the potential of socio-economic and conflict transformation to the benefit of grassroots communities,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said that the manifestation of diplomacy as a resilient tool in the mitigation of terrorism and insurgency in West Africa is consolidated in the strenuous efforts adopted by several peace actors.\n\nThese actors he noted include the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU), the European Union (EU), the United Nations, and a number of bilateral partners who have contributed to the development and introduction of several strategies to counter and combat rising threats of terrorism and insurgency in the Sahel.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of AFRPN, Ambassador Tijjani Muhammed Bande said that fighting insurgency in Nigeria without addressing the same in Niger or Chad would amount to act in futility.\n\nThe Commandant, National Defence College Rear Admiral OB Daji that Non-state actors and terrorist groups across West Africa, especially in Nigeria, the Lake Chad region, Mali and Burkina Faso represent a sustained challenge to the authority of the various States in West Africa as well as the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their countries.\n\nQuoting UNDP data, Rear Admiral Daji disclosed that Boko Haram has killed some 350,000 people in Nigeria between 2009 and 2020, with 3 million people displaced and 310,000 refugees in various camps during the same period.\n\nHe further revealed that this is in addition to properties, both private and public, that have been destroyed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe twin scourge has also led to mass disruption of economic activities, including farming (crops and animal husbandry). Other countries badly affected by terrorism and insurgency in the region have suffered a similar experiences in varying degrees. Against this background, any forum that is devoted to finding solutions to the twin scourges of Terrorism and Insurgency, as of today\u2019s event, must be applauded. This is why I am very pleased to be here to make these few remarks from the perspective of the National Defence College (NDC), Nigeria as far as the role of diplomacy in combating terrorism and insurgency in the West African region is concerned.\n\n\u201cIt is our firm belief that the menace of terrorism and insurgency in West Africa and, indeed, other parts of the world cannot be effectively tackled unless governments combine both kinetic and non-kinetic measures in such a manner that guarantees sustained action. The two challenges have also assumed cross-border, international dimensions, such that no one country can solve them alone without collaborating with others. Diplomacy is an essential element of national power, in addition to Information, Military, and the Economy (DIME) which can be deployed to address these challenges. Diplomacy as a tool for negotiation and the use of peaceful means of resolving conflicts through engagement has therefore become a sine qua non for finding lasting solutions to the challenges,\u201d The Commandant explained.\n\nEarlier in a pre-conference press briefing, the President, Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria (AFRPN) Ambassador Gani Lawal said the annual lecture/conference is designed to interrogate issues of the moment by experienced Foreign Relations Practitioners.\n\nHe said that the Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria (AFRPN) is made up of retired and serving Nigerian diplomats and all stakeholders in the business of Foreign Relations.\n\nThe President also explained what the association is set out to accomplish, \u201cour aim is to impact the foreign policy of Nigeria in a positive way from the perspectives of reasoned options emanating from the synergy and brainstorming exercise of experienced practitioners through lectures, workshop, and publications as well as mentoring of upcoming diplomats\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria and indeed other West African countries had been plagued with the scourge of terrorism, insurgency, and other trans-border crimes, hence the relevance of the topic of this year\u2019s lecture which was designed to proffer diplomatic solutions to the identified scourge\u201d.\n\nHe also explained that \u201cThis topic has been carefully selected to create an opportunity to listen to the perspectives of diplomatic professionals who have been in the front line of combating terrorism and insurgency. The guest lecturer is no less a personality than the former chairman of ECOWAS Commission, Ambassador Ibn Chambas and the chairman of the occasion is current Nigeria\u2019s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Prof Tijjani Muhammed Bande\u201d.",

It is a known fact that in the recent past, over 1,000 members of Boko Haram and their families have surrendered to the troops due to the intense pressure from troops\u2019 sustained offensive actions. Among those were key leaders of the terrorist group who have renounced their membership and have turned themselves in.\n\n\u201cThe NA being a professional military organisation will continue to act in accordance with the dictates of the Nigerian Constitution, as well as international best practices. It must be known that the NA will never encourage any act of lawlessness or extrajudicial killings. Accordingly, all surrendered terrorists will be received, processed, and passed on to the relevant agencies of Government for further assessment in line with extant provisions.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing Operation Safe Corridor is an outfit established by the Federal Government and not the NA. As such, it is absolutely wrong to say that the NA will free repentant terrorists. The NA, therefore, appeals to the public to disregard the deliberate distortion of facts by these online mediums and continue to support the NA in order to rid the country of terrorism and other forms of insecurity\u201d.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya however, reiterated his admonition to all terrorist groups operating in the country to abandon their illegitimate cause and surrender to the troops.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has called on state governments and citizens to take more proactive steps to combat the outbreak of cholera across states in Nigeria.\n\nThe agency made the appeal in a report released on Monday, where it stated that there have been 31,425 suspected cases of cholera and 816 deaths reported from 22 states and the FCT, between January 1 and August 1, 2021.\n\nThe affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and the FCT.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, the recent outbreak has been exacerbated by poor access to clean water, open defecation, poor sanitation, and hygiene.\n\nAlthough the NCDC activated the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on June 22 and has deployed rapid response teams to support the most affected states, it warned that those actions won\u2019t be enough.\n\n\u201cNone of these medical interventions will solve the underlying issues leading to cholera outbreaks,\u201d it warned.\n\n\u201cCholera is a waterborne disease, and the risk of transmission is higher when there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, practices such as the wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use.\n\n\u201cThese lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Without proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths,\u201d the NCDC added.\n\nTo address the underlying issues in the long term, there is a need for access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene.\n\n\u201cWe continue to advocate for State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities,\u201d it added.\n\nAlso, the agency urged Nigerians to \u201ckeep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running water\u201d.\n\nApart from calling for stronger water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), the NCDC is also ramping up efforts to stop the outbreak through the EOC, which is hosted at the NCDC includes representation from the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organization (WHO) and partners.\n\nSo far, it has deployed rapid response teams to Benue, Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Bauchi, and Plateau State, which are the most affected states.\n\nAdditionally, it has, along with its partners, provided states with commodities for case management and laboratory diagnosis, materials for risk communications, response guidelines among other support.\n\nFrom July 24 to 28, a reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA.\n\nThe Cholera outbreak in Nigeria has worsened in recent months with more states reporting deaths, adding pressure to an already stretched health sector that has battled the COVID-19 pandemic and is currently weighed down by the strike by resident doctors which is now in its second week.\n\nOn Saturday, the Katsina State Government confirmed that it had recorded over 60 Cholera deaths.\n\n\u201cPresently, we have over 1,400 confirmed cases of cholera with over 60 recorded deads,\u201d the Katsina State Commissioner for Health, Yakubu Danja, said during the 2021 Annual General Meeting of the State chapter of Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) held in the state capital.\n\nThe NCDC in its report advised Nigerians to visit a health facility immediately if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.\n\n\u201cCholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately,\u201d it warned.",

          "text": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned over a barrage of sexual harassment allegations Tuesday in a fall from grace a year after he was widely hailed nationally for his detailed daily briefings and leadership during the darkest days of COVID-19.\n\nThe three-term governor\u2019s decision, which will take effect in two weeks, was announced as momentum built in the Legislature to remove him by impeachment. It came after New York\u2019s attorney general released the results of an investigation that found Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women.\n\nInvestigators said he subjected women to unwanted kisses; groped their breasts or buttocks or otherwise touched them inappropriately; made insinuating remarks about their looks and their sex lives; and created a work environment \u201crife with fear and intimidation.\u201d\n\nLt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a 62-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress from the Buffalo area, will become the state\u2019s 57th governor and the first woman to hold the post.\n\nThe #MeToo-era scandal cut short not just a career but a dynasty: Cuomo\u2019s father, Mario Cuomo, was governor in the 1980s and \u201990s, and the younger Cuomo was often mentioned as a potential candidate for president, an office his father famously contemplated seeking. Even as the scandal mushroomed, Cuomo was planning to run for reelection in 2022.\n\nCuomo still faces the possibility of criminal charges, with a number of prosecutors around the state moving to investigate him.\n\nThe string of accusations that spelled the governor\u2019s downfall began to unfold in news reports last December and went on for months.\n\nCuomo called some of the allegations fabricated, forcefully denying he touched anyone inappropriately. But he acknowledged making some aides uncomfortable with comments he said he intended as playful, and he apologized for some of his behavior.\n\nHe portrayed some of the encounters as misunderstandings attributable to \u201cgenerational or cultural\u201d differences, a reference in part to his upbringing in an affectionate Italian American family.\n\nAs a defiant Cuomo clung to office, state lawmakers launched an impeachment investigation, and nearly the entire Democratic establishment in New York deserted him \u2014 not only over the accusations, but also because of the discovery that his administration had concealed thousands of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home patients.\n\nThe harassment investigation ordered up by the attorney general and conducted by two outside lawyers corroborated the women\u2019s accounts and added lurid new ones. The release of the report left the governor more isolated than ever, with some of his most loyal supporters abandoning him and President Joe Biden joining those calling on him to resign.\n\nHis accusers included an aide who said Cuomo groped her breast at the governor\u2019s mansion. Investigators also the governor\u2019s staff retaliated against one of his accusers by leaking confidential personnel files about her.\n\nAs governor, Cuomo touted himself as an example of a \u201cprogressive Democrat\u201d who gets things done: Since taking office in 2011, he helped push through legislation that legalized gay marriage, began lifting the minimum wage to $15 and expanded paid family leave benefits. He also backed big infrastructure projects, including airport overhauls and construction of a new bridge over the Hudson River that he named after his father.\n\nAt the same time the behavior that got him into trouble was going on, he was publicly championing the #MeToo movement and surrounding himself with women\u2019s rights activists, signing into law sweeping new protections against sexual harassment and lengthening the statute of limitations in rape cases.\n\nHis national popularity soared during the harrowing spring of 2020, when New York became the epicenter of the nation\u2019s coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHis tough-minded but empathetic response made for riveting television well beyond New York, and his stern warnings to people to stay home and wear masks stood in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump\u2019s brush-off of the virus. His briefings won an international Emmy Award, and he went on to write a book on leadership in a crisis.\n\nBut even those accomplishments were soon tainted when it was learned that the state\u2019s official count of nursing home deaths had excluded many patients who had been transferred to hospitals before they succumbed. A Cuomo aide acknowledged the administration feared the true numbers would be \u201cused against us\u201d by the Trump White House.\n\nAlso, Cuomo\u2019s administration was fiercely criticized for forcing nursing homes to accept patients recovering from the virus.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department is investigating the state\u2019s handling of data on nursing home deaths. In addition, the state attorney general is looking into whether Cuomo broke the law in using members of his staff to help write and promote his book, from which he stood to make more than $5 million.\n\nThe governor had also increasingly come under fire over his rough and sometimes vindictive treatment of fellow politicians and his own staff, with former aides telling stories of a brutal work environment.\n\nCuomo has been divorced since 2005 from the author and activist Kerry Kennedy, a member of the Kennedy family, and was romantically involved up until 2019 with TV lifestyle personality Sandra Lee. He has three adult daughters.\n\nHe gained political experience early on as his father\u2019s hard-nosed and often ruthless campaign manager, and went on to become New York attorney general and U.S. housing secretary under President Bill Clinton before getting elected governor in 2010.\n\nNew York has seen a string of high-level political figures brought down in disgrace in recent years.\n\nGov. Eliot Spitzer resigned in 2008 in a call-girl scandal. Rep. Anthony Weiner went to prison for sexting with a 15-year-old girl. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stepped down in 2018 after four women accused him of abuse. And the top two leaders in the Legislature were convicted of corruption.",

          "text": "A South African court has again postponed a long-delayed corruption trial against jailed former president Jacob Zuma to September 9 following his hospitalisation last week for an undisclosed medical condition.\n\nZuma, whose jailing last month for 15 months on a separate contempt of court matter led to a wave of looting and unrest, was expected to appear in court in a $2 billion arms deal corruption case that led to his sacking as South Africa\u2019s deputy president in 2005.\n\nHe was moved to a hospital on Friday for medical observation. Prison officials did not provide details on his condition.\n\nHigh Court Judge Piet Koen granted the postponement but ordered Zuma\u2019s team to produce a medical report by Aug. 20. He also ordered the state to appoint a medical doctor of its choice to assess whether Zuma was fit to stand trial and give evidence.\n\n\u201cWe are at the moment completely in the dark as to the justification for the postponement, more particularly Mr Zuma\u2019s condition,\u201d said Wim Trengove, representing the National Prosecuting Authority, during a virtual hearing.\n\nTrengove said that, according to a letter from Zuma\u2019s doctor, the former president suffered from a condition requiring extensive emergency procedures that had been delayed for 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe find it very hard to understand how that suddenly transforms into an inability to stand trial,\u201d he said.\n\nZuma\u2019s lawyer Dali Mpofu said his client\u2019s medical condition was a matter of confidentiality.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the problem has existed for 18 months is exactly the reason why it is exacerbated now, especially since the incarceration of the accused,\u201d he told the hearing.\n\nZuma, 79, last month asked the Constitutional Court to annul his jail sentence, partly on the grounds that he was suffering from an unspecified medical condition.\n\nIn the dock with French arms firm Thales (TCFP.PA), Zuma is facing 18 charges including corruption and money laundering and has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Thales has also denied wrongdoing.",
