          "text": ".\n\nBy Adeola Badru\n\nThe founder and General Superintendent of Deeper Life Bible Church (DLBC), Pastor William Kumuyi, yesterday, cautioned against any attempt by a group of persons or individuals to cause the disintegration of the country.\n\nKumuyi, who is in Ibadan for a six-day crusade (beginning from January 27-30) tagged: \u201cIbadan Global Crusade,\u201d said God had a divine purpose for making Nigeria a nation some 100 years ago, adding that no mortal could alter God\u2019s plan for the individuals within the nation.\n\nHe said: I think sometimes we magnify our problems and we minimize our hope. For anybody to say even if God were to come to Nigeria that person doesn\u2019t think there will be any change, I think that is going too far. It\u2019s making us hopeless and makes a mountain out of a molehill. We should still have hope in God, and we should know that Nigerians are not in total despair.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nLet\u2019s battle subsidy untruths together, govs woo Labour\n\n\u201cThe same Nigerians are doing well in the US, in Europe and other places. It\u2019s not like we do not have people that have the foresight, the intelligence, the education, the experience and everything that can turn things around. Ours is to hopefully and positively look for such people and can join hands together and build our nation and I believe that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy message will be that we need to understand that our destiny is in our hand. For example we know about Sodom and Gomorrah and the lord said Abraham i planned doing something but I can\u2019t do it without letting you know. \u201c\n\n\u201cAbraham was a man of authority not only in his family or community but God gave him authority to even affect or influence the condition of Sodom and Gomorrah. So he said God hold on, I hear what you\u2019re talking but if you find this number of right people, would you spare them, how about forty, how about twenty or ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lord did not stop him but he stopped at ten but couldn\u2019t find ten people. Again you see the authority that he carried. Jonah came to Nineveh and said as for Nineveh, this is what will happen because they were evil and wicked exceedingly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t use his authority as a prophet to stop that but then the authority pass to the hand of the king and the king then commanded the whole of Nineveh and said let\u2019s repent, let\u2019s get it done and again because of that intervention of the king, they were not destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we hear of what is happening, those are facts like what\u2019s happening in Sodom and Gomorrah, Fact. What happened Nineveh, those are fact; but then, there are men that will take the horn of the altar and say God since you\u2019ve given us an opportunity, He said as for my creation, command me, the demand of me what you want me to do and he will do it. I think it depends on how will recognize our authority and our place in the nation and many nations.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking ahead of the 2023 elections in the country and the array of leaders to watch out for, the man of God said: \u201cI think we should pray that God will give us the best and give us leaders that will turn around the nation for the better but then like a farmer has good land, he has good seed and keep praying that God will give him a bountiful harvest but he doesn\u2019t cultivate nor plant nor reap nor do anything.\u201d\n\nThe nation will go hungry and he will remain poor. We pray we also act. God has told us faith without corresponding action is dead. So we pray for good leadership, for the best leadership but then we must use our hand and vote for the people that God leads us to vote for that will turn the situation of the country around. We pray, We also act,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Ahmed Muktar in Abuja, the group argued that it will be in the party\u2019s greater interest to go with the earlier stand of its National Executive Committee, NEC, to make the Presidential race open to all zones.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cthe best candidate, who can win the Presidential election for the PDP and change the terrible mess which the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has turned Nigeria into, should be allowed to emerge from any zone in the country.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s statement was in response to a recent press release by Prince Kassim Afegbua, a former Commissioner in Edo State and one of the former spokespersons of Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign during the 2019 presidential election.\n\nAfegbua, had in his press release, said\n\namong other things: \u201cFor me, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar should quit his quest for presidency and support a southern Nigerian candidate in the spirit of fairness, equity and justice as that will assuage the feelings of stakeholders from the Southern part of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt will be against the run of play and natural justice for any aspirant of Northern extraction to show interest in the 2023 presidential election within the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party threshold.\n\n\u201cGiven PDP\u2019s doctrine of political power balancing and fairness, it will be against its own unwritten rule to cede the ticket to any Northern aspirant, least of all Alhaji Atiku Abubakar\u201d, Afegbua stated.\n\nHowever, the Justice and Equity Group said it is undemocratic to ask a qualified Nigerian not to contest for Presidency.\n\n\u201cWe think that in the greater interest of the PDP, we should abide by the earlier PDP National Executive Committee decision that threw open the presidential ticket of PDP to all zones.\n\n\u201cLet the best candidate that can win the election for the PDP and change the terrible mess APC has turned Nigeria into, to emerge.\n\n\u201cWhile it is undemocratic to ask a qualified Nigerian not to contest for Presidency, we agree substantially that Atiku Abubakar has had his time and opportunities.\n\n\u201cHe (Atiku) was presented in 2018/2019 as the only one with the capacity, the financial muscle , the experience to beat President Buhari. He fluffed the chance given to him by PDP. Age is also not on his side on 2023.\n\n\u201cNigerians have become weary of his perennial and perpetual candidature. It may be time for him to give a younger person a chance.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that Obasanjo from the South contested against General Buhari from the North. Nobody mentioned that it was the turn of the North or South, because different parties are governed by their own interests.\n\n\u201cThe PDP should be governed by permutations that will give it victory.\n\n\u201cA blanket ban on any region from contesting for Presidency under PDP is manifestly and patently unreasonable, unjust, unfair and contrary to natural justice. It is wrong and will not fly in a democracy.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the North has better claims to the PDP ticket than the South in 2023\u201d, the statement read.\n\nThe group faulted Afegbua\u2019s position that \u2018it will be against the run of play and natural justice for any aspirant of Northern extraction to show interest in the 2023 presidential election within the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party threshold.\u201d\n\nAccording to the JEG, \u201cpolitics in Nigeria, under the 1999 Constitution, is played by political parties, not interest groups, geopolitical groups or even individuals. It is political parties that can field candidates. Nigeria as an entity cannot field a candidate. The North or South cannot field a candidate too.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous for any one to mix up the fortunes and tactics of the political parties.\n\nIn the APC, President Buhari from the North is about to complete 8 years, so it is perfectly normal for APC to look for a candidate from the Southern part of the country to fly its flag in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe matter is not the same in PDP , which is a distinct political party, governed by its rules and traditions. In PDP, under its constitution, the principle of zoning and rotation is respected,\u201d it added.",

The PSC is not going to set up a panel to try DCP Abba Kyari or look into his case separately.\n\n\u201cThe plenary has not deliberated on the aspect of discipline for officers. It will be looked into jointly with other disciplinary cases of other officers having issues. Kyari\u2019s case and others will be decided after due consideration of everything. We do not treat any disciplinary cases in isolation.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nHushpuppi: Lawyers abandon suit seeking to stop Abba Kyari\u2019s extradition\n\nOn when the planery will reconvene, he said, \u201cThe planery for disciplinary issues is adjourned till February 2022. What we considered today are promotion and appeals.\n\nRecall that at the last plenary, the PSC presided by its Chairman, former IGP Musiliu Smith, after its 13 plenary meeting in Abuja which was held on Monday 20 December and Tuesday 21 December, directed a Commissioner of Police, CP Abdulkarim Dauda to tender his letter of retirement with immediate effect for breach of due process and illegal extension of tenure.\n\nAbdulkarim Dauda who was a one time Chief Security Officer (CSO) to former President Goodluck Jonathan and also worked briefly with President Muhammadu Buhari and was due for retirement from the NPF after attaining the mandatory 35 years in service was also been directed to refund salaries he collected from the Police from January 2020 to December 2021.\n\nThough CP Dauda claimed that he was given an extension of service during the tenure of former IGP Mohammed Adamu to the year 2021, the PSC said all the records were searched and there was nowhere or any document showing that President Muhammadu Buhari approved an extension for him while there was also no record showing when or where IGP Adamu authorized his extension of service.\n\n\u201cSo the board of the PSC having discovered several infractions on the issue of extension for CP Abdulkarim Dauda without due process rejected the extension and backdated his retirement to 1st of January 2020 when he was actually due for retirement\u201d, Mr Braimoh said.\n\nConcerning Abba Kyari, a source in the commission told Vanguard that the decision of the PSC to return the investigative panel report was backed up by advice by the office of the minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami whose office the commission reverted the panel\u2019s report to after receiving it from IGP Usman Alkali.\n\nIn order to meet up with its scheduled plenary meeting where matters of discipline and other infractions against several Police officers will be deliberated upon and decisions are taken, the PSC was said to have given the Force headquarters 14 days within which to conclude the new review and revert to the commission.\n\nRecall that DCP Abba Kyari was suspended in July 2021 over the Hushpuppi fraud allegations after he was queried, to allow for unhindered investigation and replaced by DCP Tunji Disu as IRT Commander.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "2023: Igbo well prepared for Presidency \u2014 Ohanaeze",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Anayo Okoli, ENUGU\n\nAMIDST doubts by sections of the country over the preparedness of the South East to contest for the presidency next year, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has declared that Ndigbo is today better prepared than the North in 2015 when Presidency was given to them.\n\nOhanaeze however said that as much as the Igbo are ready; leaders are always instrumental to the emergence of their successors and urged President Muhammadu Buhari to play the required role expected of him as the President.\n\nThe President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor, in a statement yesterday, said that Igbos are prepared and ready for the 2023 Presidency, insisting that the position of things in Igbo land today is much more favourable and conducive than in 2015 and 1998 when President Buhari from the North emerged.\n\n\u201cLet it be known and clearly understood that Ndigbo is more prepared than the North when President Buhari was elected in 2015. By then, Boko Haram had threatened to overrun the North and the country, and the nation\u2019s priority then was security and the issue of who will guarantee security to the country favoured Buhari, a former Head of State, a General. The only preparation in the north was having available, a man like Buhari presumed to have the capacity to confront the security challenges in the North and the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cIn the South West, how prepared were they in 1999 when President Obasanjo was elected? Many people from the South-West did not vote for him in that election. The people of the southwest zone were deep in the crises of NADECO and displeasure over the June 12, 1993 election annulment. But notwithstanding, the Nigerian nation and the people through the two main national political parties zoned the Presidency to the South West to heal and reconcile the nation over the 1993 election crisis.\n\n\u201cToday, if the truth must be told, the imperative of zoning the Presidency to the South East is an idea whose time has come.\n\n\u201cCertainly, Ndigbo is prepared and looks forward to it as a national priority. It is also indeed reasonable and logical that before any other zone in the country goes for a second turn of occupying the office of the President, Ndigbo should at least have their first turn\u201d, Ohanaeze said.\n\nThe apex Igbo cultural body, therefore, urged President Buhari to play his required role to ensure that a southeast person emerges the president.\n\n\u201cNo leader in history was ever indifferent about who would succeed him and President Buhari will not be an exception. Consequently, it is expected that Mr President must have a critical role in the emergence of his successor.\n\n\u201cTo this effect, it is important for the President not to lose sight of political developments that may be injurious to national unity and corporate existence of the country. It is the national expectation that Mr President continues his policy of national healing and reconciliation to a logical conclusion\u201d, Obiozor noted.\n\nOhanaeze argued along with people who wonder how anybody who loves this country will talk of the Presidency coming to the South West in 2023, wondering why the southeast should be excluded or is southeast not part of Nigeria?\n\n\u201cIt will be unfair, unjust, and unpatriotic as well as against the national spirit and interest to deny Ndigbo their opportunity and pretend as if they do not exist as part of the Nigerian nation.\n\n\u201cNdigbo waited patiently and cooperatively for the Southern zones, South West and South-South to have their opportunities to produce the country\u2019s Presidents. Who wants to push Ndigbo out of Nigeria by denying them a place in history, to produce the President of Nigeria?\u201d Ohanaeze wondered.\n\nContinuing, Ohanaeze Ndigbo cautioned leaders in Nigeria to \u201cbe mindful of those who want to pursue a politically motivated strategy that treats the South East as a hostile territory which is a grossly wrong and unacceptable definition of the situation in the southeast\u201d.\n\nAlluding to agitation by members of IPOB, the statement reminded Nigerians that \u201can overwhelming majority of Ndigbo do not believe in secession or separatism from Nigeria. An Igbo President will focus on what can be done, instead of arguing over what is impossible.\n\n\u201cIndeed, there is no doubt that in the history of Nigeria from Nnamdi Azikiwe to the present, Ndigbo has demonstrated the highest virtues of patriotism and genuine nationalistic propensities. By history and character, what defines Ndigbo is the friendliness and peaceful coexistence with others regardless of tribe, religion, or race. Ndigbo is market people, travellers, entrepreneurs, or businessmen.\n\n\u201cWe know that the devil in Nigerian politics is power-sharing and an Igbo President will demonstrate to all Nigerians that power-sharing can be done peacefully, justifiably with equity and fairness to all and his willingness to take last.\n\n\u201cThe fear of Ndigbo by other ethnic groups is equally unjustified and fiction of the imagination of those who create a distorted image of Ndigbo. We seek a solution and not a blame game\u201d, Ohanaeze assured.\n\n\u201cConsequently, indeed, it is politically wise and reasonable, morally justifiable and defensible and patriotically persuasive for all the parties to zone the Presidency to the South East. For any zone in the South to aspire to hold the Presidency twice while the southeast has not had it even for once, will be politically and morally unjustifiable and a national political blunder as well as a clear and open case of discrimination.\n\n\u201cAbove all, it smacks of reckless political adventurism to despise or ignore other people\u2019s feelings or their fundamental rights as fellow citizens. No politician in Nigeria this time should have the illusion that Nigerians don\u2019t know what is wrong or right; Nigerians are awake.\n\n\u201cIn Igbo land today, we have many competent personalities that can confront and solve Nigeria\u2019s perennial and endemic socio-political problems and guarantee peaceful coexistence for all the citizens regardless of ethnicity, religion, or race. We are ready and with an Igbo President, Nigeria and Nigerians will experience the true meaning of a Federation with justice, equity, and fairness\u201d, Obiozor assured in the statement.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Benue Youth Forum, BYF has asked Nigerians to caution the presidency against its constant attack on Governor Samuel Ortom over his comments on the state of the nation.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the presidency led by the Senior Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu and the Benue governor had recently engaged in a war of words.\n\nTrouble began when Governor Ortom granted an interview on Television where he alleged shortcomings of the Buhari-led government particularly on security and the economy.\n\nGovernor Ortom had in the interview, said Nigeria is witnessing the highest level of corruption in its history under President Buhari, stressing that the nation\u2019s economy has collapsed following inflation, unemployment and poverty which according to him, has rendered citizens destitute.\n\nBut Garba Shehu, President Buhari\u2019s spokesperson, in reaction to the interview accused Ortom of abandoning his primary responsibilities in the state to focus on attacking the President.\n\nGarba accused Ortom of owing the highest salary arrears of civil servants in Nigeria.\n\nIn reaction to the recent spat between the presidency and Ortom, Benue youths, in a statement issued by its president, Terrence Kuanum on Thursday, asked the presidency to apologize to all Nigerians for attacking those speaking out on the nation\u2019s reality.\n\nThe youths also warned the presidency to leave Ortom alone, saying the governor is not responsible for the Federal Government\u2019s misfortunes.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cGovernor Ortom remains one of the strong voices of helpless Nigerians who are victims of impunity, marginalization and injustice being perpetrated by the Buhari regime. He is a true patriot who has constantly challenged the Federal Government to fulfil its promises to provide security for the people, end corruption and fix the economy.\n\n\u201cInstead of responding to the burning issues of national interest raised by the Benue State Governor, the Presidency, through the loud-mouthed and unprofessional Garba Shehu elected to attack the person of the Governor.\n\nThis is evidence of crass ineptitude, brazen impunity, shocking docility and laughable failure exemplified by the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cWhy has the Presidency not responded to Governor Ortom on the fact that under its watch, Nigeria is witnessing the highest level of corruption in the country\u2019s history? Why has the Presidency not faulted Governor Ortom on his statement that the nation is experiencing the worst spate of insecurity since its independence? Why has the Presidency not proven Governor Ortom wrong on the glaring reality that the economy has collapsed with inflation, unemployment and poverty hitting an all-time high with millions of Nigerians rendered destitute?\n\n\u201cWhy has the Presidency not countered Governor Ortom that under Buhari, Nigerians are more divided than at any other time in the history of the country with nepotism elevated and the people told to go to hell? Why has the Presidency not proven the Benue State Governor wrong on his statement that it accords preference to cattle over human life?\n\n\u201cHas President Buhari not gone on national television many times to insist that cattle routes must be created in parts of the country to grant easy passage to the animals?\n\n\u201cThe above are only a few of the issues Governor Samuel Ortom has constantly raised on behalf of millions of Nigerians who do not have a voice. We, therefore, expected the Presidency to respond specifically to those issues and not castigate the Governor.\n\n\u201cIt is crystal clear that the Buhari administration has failed and is now in desperate need of whom to blame for its self-inflicted woes. The speed with which it descends on Nigerians who dare to speak out against its evil agenda amounts to the kicks of a dying horse.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Presidency to leave Governor Ortom alone. The Governor is not responsible for the failure of the present government at the centre. The Presidency has the option of apologizing to Nigerians for its inability and deception.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, we restate our solid stand behind our Governor, Samuel Ortom in his unmistakable presentations on national issues and the recommendations he often makes for the way forward. This is democracy anchored on constitutional laws and no longer military decrees! The Federal Government must allow Nigerians the freedom to express their views on issues affecting them.\n\n\u201cWe call on all patriots to caution the Presidency to desist from attacking those who make their opinions public on issues. President Buhari was elected to serve the entire country not only the interest of a few. We will not fold our arms and watch the sustained campaign of hatred that the government of Muhammadu Buhari has waged against the person of Governor Ortom.\n\n\u201cLastly, we wish to remind Garba Shehu and other enemies of Nigeria that posterity is the judge. They should remember the evergreen words of the late renowned journalist Dele Giwa when he said in 1984, \u201cAny evil done by man to man will be redressed, if not now, then certainly later, if not by man, then certainly by God, for the victory of evil over good can only be temporary.\u201d",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja and Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nThe Abuja division of the Federal High Court has barred the Federal Government from making further deductions from the Federation Account to fund its agencies not listed in the 1999 Constitution for direct allocation.\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed in a judgment, yesterday, declared as illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional the direct allocations made so far by the Federal Government from the Federation Account to fund the Nigeria Police Trust Fund.\n\nThe judgment followed a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/511/2020, filed on behalf of the Rivers State Government, by a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Joseph Daudu (SAN), challenging unlawful deductions from the Federation Account by the Federal Government.\n\nJustice Mohammed held that section 161 and section 162 of the 1999 Constitution were glaringly breached by the Federal Government in making direct allocation to the Police Trust Fund from the Federation Account.\n\nThe Judge held that section 162 of the 1999 Constitution is clear and unambiguous to the effect that only the federal, states and local governments shall be allocated funds directly from the Federation Account.\n\nHe also held that Section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the Federal Government to justify the deductions from the Federation Account is inconsistent with section 162 of the 1999 Constitution which recognises only the federal, states and local governments.\n\nJustice Mohammed upheld that the suit by Rivers State against the unjust deduction had succeeded and ordered that funds belonging to Rivers State, but used to fund Nigeria Police Trust fund by the Federal Government, be refunded to the state.\n\nThe judge, however, declined to extend the same order for a refund to the other 35 states on the grounds that they were not parties to the suit. He ruled that Rivers State as the plaintiff in he matter did not file it on behalf of other states of the federation.\n\nDefendant in the matter were Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Accountant General of the Federation, Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission and Minister of Finance.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe AGF had in his preliminary objection asked the Federal High Court to decline jurisdiction in the matter on the grounds that such suit ought to be filed directly at the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the preliminary objection was dismissed by Justice Mohammed on the grounds that it was misplaced, absurd and unmeritorious.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Nyesom Wike, in his reaction, said the court verdict was a resounding victory for democracy because the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act, which the Federal Government relied on to deduct funds from the Federation Account, is in contravention of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is a victory for democracy. And I have always told people, it is not whether you must win or not, but it is a matter of when you see issues that you think are in contravention of our Constitution and other laws, there is nothing wrong for you to challenge it, so that the right thing can be done.\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the money is given back to us, we can still on our own say police, we want to support you with this. But not the Federal Government arbitrarily deducting our money from the Federation Account and putting it to Police Trust Fund. I don\u2019t think that that is right and I thank God that today the court has made a clear pronouncement on it.\u201d\n\nThe governor acknowledged that though the National Assembly is constitutionally empowered to enact laws, in enacting the Police Trust Fund Act, they went beyond their powers by contravening the provisions of the Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further on the order of the court that the state government should be refunded the money deducted from its share to fund the police, Governor Wike said the order will put an end to impunity.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the court has said that they should refund us all the money deducted and luckily the principal parties, Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission, the Accountant General, Attorney General Office they are all involved in the case.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Rivers State but it is about the impunity, it is about the violation of the constitution as if anybody can wake up one early morning and just decide to do one or two things, which is wrong. And I am happy that the decision we took, we are not wrong and I thank my legal team.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Orders refund to state\n\n\u2022It\u2019s victory for democracy, says Wike\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court yesterday declared as illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional the direct allocations made by the federal government from the federation account to fund the Nigeria Police Trust Fund. Mohammed barred the federal government from further deductions from the federation account to fund agencies not listed in the 1999 Constitution for direct allocation.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, stated that the judgement was a resounding victory for democracy.\n\nThe court, in the judgment, held that Section 161 and Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution were glaringly breached by the federal government following the direct allocation from the federation account to the Police Trust Fund.\n\nThe suit challenging the continued deductions from the federation account to fund agencies belonging to the federal government was filed by the Rivers State Government.\n\nDelivering judgement, the court held that Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution was clear and unambiguous to the effect that only the federal, states and local governments shall be allocated fund directly from the federation account.\n\nThe court also held that Section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the federal government to justify the unlawful deductions from the federation account was inconsistent with section 162 of the 1999 Constitution which recognises only the federal, states and local governments.\n\nMohammed, while upholding the suit by Rivers State against the deductions, ordered that the fund belonging to Rivers State but used to fund the Nigeria Police Trust fund by the federal government should be refunded to the state.\n\nThe judge, however, declined to extend similar order of refund to the 35 remaining states on the grounds that they were not parties in the suit, adding that Rivers State, as the plaintiff in this matter, did not file it on behalf of others.\n\nThe court upheld all arguments of Joseph Daudu, who stood for Rivers State, that where the provisions of the 1999 Constitution are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their ordinary meanings.\n\nMohammed also agreed with Daudu that the federal government was completely wrong in the interpretation given to section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act to the effect that the Nigerian Police was established for the federal government alone and as such the funding should solely be on the shoulders of the federal government.\n\nRivers State in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/511/2020 and instituted on its behalf by former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Daudu, had challenged the decision of the federal government to allocate funds directly from the federation account to fund some of its agencies, stating that the decision violates section 162 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe Rivers State government also stated that the actions of the federal government deprived it substantial revenue from the federation account and, therefore, prayed the court to nullify the allocation from the federation account.\n\nThe plaintiff also claimed that the levies imposed on companies operating in Nigeria by the federal government, be paid directly to the Nigeria Police Force Trust Fund, instead of the federation account was also illegal.\n\nThe judge agreed with the plaintiff that under the relevant laws, such levies were supposed to be paid directly to the federation account and not to any federal government agencies.\n\nThe judge held, \u201cI have carefully perused the issues raised by the plaintiff and I agree that no other person or entity is permitted to benefit direct fund allocation from the federation account.\n\n\u201cSection 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the defendant to make direct fund allocation from the Federation Account is untenable as it runs contrary to section 162 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, which expressly stated that the federal government, state governments and local governments shall derive direct fund allocation from the federation account.\u201d\n\nDefendant in the matter were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF); Accountant General of the Federation; Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission and Minister of Finance.\n\nHowever only the Attorney General of the Federation filled processes to defend the federal government\u2019s action.\n\nThe AGF had in his preliminary objection asked the Federal High Court to decline jurisdiction in the matter on the ground that such suit ought to be filed directly at the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the preliminary objection was dismissed by Mohammed on the ground that it was misplaced and absurd.\n\nMeanwhile, Wike hailed the ruling, noting that the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act, which the federal government relied on deduct funds from the Federation Account was in contravention of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cI have always told people, it is not whether you must win or not, but it is a matter of when you see issues that you think are in contravention of our constitution and other laws, there is nothing wrong for you to challenge it, so that the right thing can be done.\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the money is given back to us, we can still on our own say police, we want to support you with this.

The Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the sum at its weekly meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe N3 trillion now budgeted to sustain the payment of subsidy in 2022 alone, amounts to 17.5 per cent of the total of N17.126 trillion 2022 budget that was signed into law on the last day of 2021. Already, the approved 2022 budget has a deficit of N6.39 trillion, which is 37 per cent of the N17.126 trillion. This is a clear indication that the government may borrow more this year than it had earlier projected.\n\nThe N3 trillion approved by FEC is 55 per cent and 43 per cent of the capital component and recurrent expenditure of the 2022 budget, respectively.\n\nImplementation of the PIA, which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy, was initially meant to commence in February 2022, but it was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threat of protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the removal of subsidy was suspended on Monday.\n\nBut NLC, Lagos chapter, yesterday criticised the federal government\u2019s decision to recommend an 18-month extension of the PIA to the National Assembly.\n\nOn its part, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) urged the federal government to introduce palliatives to cushion the effect of subsidy withdrawal, irrespective of the postponement of the policy, as well as fix all the country\u2019s refineries.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said only about eight states were presently benefitting directly from petrol subsidy. Fayemi said this at a joint meeting between the state governors, NLC, and TUC over the fuel subsidy withdrawal.\n\nFEC yesterday mandated the Finance, Budget and National Planning Ministry to reconcile the fuel subsidy budget with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, which prepared the estimate.\n\nThe council meeting presided by President Muhammadu Buhari also okayed the preparation of the 2022 Supplementary Budget, which would include the repeal of Clauses 10 and 11 of the Appropriation Act as well as incorporation of N103 billion removed by the lawmakers from the initial budget estimates, for submission to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe decisions reached at the virtual FEC meeting were made public by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who briefed newsmen after the meeting.\n\nAhmed said a memo in respect of the additional funding provisions to enable government meet the incremental fuel subsidy request in the 2022 budget was presented for the council\u2019s consideration.\n\nShe said only N443 billion had been provided for in the 2022 budget to accommodate subsidy from January to June, but taking the prevailing economic realities, both locally and globally, into consideration, FEC proposed a year-long provision for the subsidy.\n\nAhmed said the request was considered by the council, which directed the ministry to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cYou would recall that in the 2022 budget, as appropriated, we have made a provision of N443 billion for subsidy for January to June. Having taken into account the current realities: increased hardship in the population, heightened inflation, and also that the measures that needed to be taken to enable a smoother exit from the fuel subsidy are not yet in place, it was agreed by Council that it is desirable to exit fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC has presented to the ministry a request for N3 trillion as fuel subsidy for 2022. What this means is that we have to make an incremental provision of N2.557 trillion to be able to meet the subsidy requirement, which is averaging about N270 billion per month.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the actual under-recovery that has been charged to the federation was N1.2 trillion, which means an average of N100 billion, but in 2022, because of the increased crude oil price per barrel in the global market, now at $80 per barrel, and also because an NNPC\u2019s assessment is that the country is consuming 65.7 million litres per day, now we\u2019ll end up with incremental cost of N3 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this has been considered by Council and we\u2019ve also been asked to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget, to also further discuss with NNPC on how to make provisions for this and how to rationalise this expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that her ministry had been directed to engage the NNPC with the possibility of bringing down the subsidy estimate.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe\u2019re going to engage NNPC to further interrogate the request that they presented with a view of trying to see how we can scale it down so that the country is not incurring N3 trillion for a fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe agreed with the view of governors, that there is a need to scale down on the size. So even as government is not immediately removing the fuel subsidy, we have to make sure that what the nation is incurring is efficient, and that it is real cost that has been consumed by the country.\u201d\n\nAhmed stated that the government would fund the N3 trillion subsidy regime through outstanding debts owed it by NNPC, which were being sorted out through on-going financial reconciliations with the company.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe have several reconciliations with NNPC, which is owing, in some cases, the government. So we want to be able to settle some of the subsidy costs through this reconciliation process.\n\n\u201cWhen we are done with that, whatever is left that we are not able to apply to what NNPC is owing the federation will not be increasing the deficit. And that means increased domestic borrowing. But we haven\u2019t finished with the issue of reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAhmed further disclosed that FEC approved the 2022 Supplementary Budget to take care of areas that were overlooked by the National Assembly in approving the Appropriation Bill. She said FEC approved amendments to parts of the 2022 budget, which had initially been adjusted by the National Assembly during its legislative deliberations on the budget proposal submitted to it by the president in 2021.\n\nAccording to her, the approved amendment to be transmitted to the National Assembly will request to repeal clauses 10 and 11 concerning the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) operations in the 2022 budget and restore the N103 billion the lawmakers had removed.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe second memo we presented to Council today has to do with a request for approval of the 2022 Appropriation Amendment. If you recall, when the president signed the 2022 appropriation into law on the 31st of December, he raised some concerns that he had in some of the provisions in the budget and had indicated that he will be submitting an amendment proposal to the National Assembly for them to effect improvements in what has been done to the budget.\n\n\u201cSo, today Council took that amendment proposal and I just want to report that part of the requests that Council has approved today is for the National Assembly to repeal clauses 10 and 11. Clause 10 is referring to a provision that has been made that will enable the EFCC and NFIU be able to take 10 per cent of whatever collections that they recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for that to be repealed because this is in direct contrast to the Acts of these two agencies and also it is in contravention of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the Finance Act 2021.\n\n\u201cClause 11, on the other hand, is a provision that has been made that says that the Nigeria embassies and missions are now authorised by this Appropriation Act to expend funds allocated to them under Capital Components without the need to seek approval of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This, again, Council agreed, is inconsistent with financial regulations and also inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act. So, we are asking for this to be repealed.\n\n\u201cCouncil also approved that some of the changes that were made in the Appropriation Act, totalling N103 billion, should be restored and examples of these are N22 billion that was provided for sinking fund to mature bonds that will be ready for payment in 2022 in the Nigerian domestic market, and also N12 billion for counterpart funding that is required for the various rail projects, and N189 million to be adjusted also in the budgets of the Ministry of Transport, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThese are projects that are provided in these ministries that are completely unrelated to their mandate, so implementation will be a problem. Also, N5 billion to be restored for non-regular allowances of the Nigerian Navy, N15 billion to be restored for the regular allowances of the police formations and police commands and several others that Council looked at in detail.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a detailed schedule of this N103 billion that Mr. President will be formally conveying to the National Assembly to restore the adjustments that were made.\u201d\n\nAhmed also disclosed that FEC ratified an instrument on diplomatic relations between Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis has to do with the confirmation of ratification of Customs Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreement between South Africa and Nigeria and the purpose for us is for the customs law in the respective territories to be properly observed to prevent and also enhance investigation and to combat customs offenses and to afford each country mutual assistance in cases concerning the delivery of documents regarding the application of customs laws in two countries.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this for us is cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa, as it has become even more important now with the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. It will also help to increase trade relations between the two countries and facilitate exchange of information as well as strengthen our bi-national cooperation.\u201d\n\nNLC Knocks FG for Proposing 18 Months Extension\n\nNLC said the federal government was only postponing the evil day. Chairperson of NLC, Lagos Chapter, Agnes Sessi, spoke yesterday on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a programme on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers. Sessi said government had been very deceitful, as it had never fulfilled its promises to Nigerians regarding the maintenance of the refineries.\n\nShe stated that successive governments had deceived the populace into believing that they had to subsidise petrol.\n\nSessi said, \u201cWe need a concerted effort to fight the problem of corruption in our society, we thought it could be better during this administration, but it is getting worse. Everybody needs to speak and kill the slogan, which says if you cannot beat them, you join them.\n\n\u201cWe are not supposed to join them because successive governments have been unable to do the turnaround maintenance, despite the huge amount of money they have spent.\u201d\n\nDefending accusations that the NLC was engaged in smuggling of petrol, Sessi insisted it was simply blackmail because they chose not to be a part of the evil plans.\n\nShe advised that people should stop shifting the blame to labour, saying the unions are only a fraction of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because government has seen the kind of mobilisation and that we were serious, that is why they made a U-turn and reversed their decision that would have caused problems and pushed Nigerians to the highest level of economic downturn,\u201d Sessi concluded.\n\nOn his part, the Director General (DG) of Micheal Imodu Institute of Labour Studies, Issa Aremu, commended the leadership of NLC for remaining focused and for keeping to the tradition of the movement of engaging policies.\n\nAccording to Aremu, \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this process so I know what it takes to mobilise and demobilise. I am happy that inclusive issues of development are up for discussions.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cI am happy that we are all on the same page and it can be business as usual within the petroleum downstream sector.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long drawn issue and I think additional 18 months cannot be too long for us to look at all the issues as we are looking at nation building and not the regime. We shouldn\u2019t be a debating but functional society.\u201d\n\nHe called on the relevant stakeholders to stop hoarding petroleum products while the transition process is being managed.\n\nThe director general insisted that labour should be a little more balanced, saying the government had retained jobs and paid salaries as and when due.\n\nIPMAN Wants Dilapidated Refineries Fixed\n\nNational Operations Controller, IPMAN, Mike Osatuyi, reiterated their support for the federal government in whatever decisions they made. Osatuyi noted that the 18 months suspension would give the government the avenue to put in palliatives and support for Nigerians.\n\nOsatuyi also clarified the notion about the group being government agents, stating that they are an association of businessmen who condemn subsidy.\n\nIPMAN, in a statement, appealed to the federal government to give priority to the revitalisation of the four refineries in the country ahead of the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products.\n\nPresident of IPMAN, Alhaji Debo Ahmed, in the statement, also appealed to the federal government to ensure the availability of petroleum products to the NNPC depots across the country. He stated that selective supply to private depots was, \u201cmaking it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN president restated his association\u2019s demand for payment of outstanding Bridging Claims owed marketers by the defunct Petroleum Equalisation Fund, now operating under the name, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe leadership of IPMAN commends the federal government for the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy. We reiterate our position that the four nations\u2019 refineries be repaired and allowed to function optimally before the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call on the federal government to resume the supply of petroleum products to NNPC depots nationwide as against the selective supply to private depots, making it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\n\n\u201cOur huge funds are tied up with PPMC Ltd, a subsidiary of NNPC, where members pay for NNPC products supplied to their depots. We are equally pleading that marketers transportation claims be paid to allow members remain afloat in business.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fayemi told the governors\u2019 meeting with NLC and TUC that only about eight states benefitted from the federal government\u2019s fuel subsidy.\n\nParticipants at the meeting called on the federal government to constitute a forensic examination on the activities of the NNPC. They alleged that the national oil company was bandying falsehood in terms of the amount being spent on petrol subsidy.\n\nThe meeting, which was held at the NGF secretariat, Abuja, brokered a partnership between the NGF and labour.\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the meeting, Fayemi argued that the country\u2019s economy was at a precipice and, \u201cit has become necessary for the two groups to carefully verify all of NNPC\u2019s estimates to ensure that whatever action is taken on subsidy, it would be the people that get direct benefits and not a few wealthy individuals and their cronies in the country.\u201d\n\nFayemi told the labour leaders that subsidy removal had remained an on-gong conversation, not just among governors, but also the country at large.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor stated that, \u201cThere are raging questions of accountability associated with subsidy removal in the country and observed that the NGF and the NLC can jointly work together to proffer solutions that heal the economy and provide succour to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman had led to the meeting the delegation of governors, which included Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State, who is also chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. He stressed that all the countries surrounding Nigeria, including Niger, Mali, Cameroun and Ghana, had their fuel pump price in dollar equivalent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says no ceremony to be held for swearing-in\n\nDavid-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nAnambra State governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has said that in order to promote domestic brands, his official vehicles when he assumes office would be those manufactured by the Innoson Vehicle Motors (IVM).\n\nSoludo who visited members of the inauguration committee stated this in his speech to the committee members.\n\nThe governor-elect also said it was not a coincidence that he had been wearing local fabrics known as Akwete, saying it was part of his intentional to support local brands and to make a statement with it.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy akwete dress is not just dress, it\u2019s a statement. I want to make a statement with it. You know, in the entire south-east, this is the only textile thing alive, and it\u2019s handmade, by the women of akwaete in Abia State.\n\n\u201cIgbo land is one and we must protect it. We want to bring back the zeal of patronising our own. I have said it even during campaigns, and I meant it, that if I win, the official car of the governor of Anambra State will be Innoson Vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe dresses I will wear are those made here (south-east). We must protect the things that are made in our place. Something is about to happen in Igboland, and together we will get there.\u201d\n\nOn his upcoming swearing-in, Soludo said there would be no ceremony to mark the event, stressing that no amount would be spent on it.\n\nHe said the day was simply to mark his first day at work, saying even though it is a weekend, he would spend eight hours of the day working.\n\n\u201cI have made a wish that not even one kobo of Anambra people\u2019s money will be spent on that swearing-in ceremony. It is a wish, and I mean it. What are we spending money on? Just few people coming to the inauguration and witnessing it, then I will open office and get down to work immediately.\n\n\u201cI do not wish any event, dancers or players and all that. I just want to show up for work, like every first work day. Though it is going to be a Friday, which is weekend, but I\u2019m going to work for over eight hours that day.\n\n\u201cNo ceremony, no event, no party, nothing. Not even 10 kobo will be spent. So the people who are saying N20 million has been budgeted should go and tell us where they will get that money. It is going to be work, work, work, and that is what we epitomise.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Okay direct, indirect, consensus primaries for parties\n\n\u2022Stipulate conditions for consensus \u2022Proposed legislation to be transmitted to Buhari in seven days\n\nUdora Orizu and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nThe Senate yesterday passed the harmonised Clause 84 of the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022, which allows political parties to adopt three modes of primaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation, earlier passed last year, was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari had cited the provisions of Clause 84, which made direct primary compulsory for all political parties in electing candidates for elections, as his reason for refusing assent to the bill. The two chambers of the National Assembly then recommitted the bill for fresh legislation and added other options, as advised by the president.\n\nThe harmonised version accommodated the direct, indirect, and consensus modes of primary election.\n\nThe Senate had earlier passed the three modes of primaries, but the version of the House of Representatives did not include the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe upper chamber considered the harmonised version of the bill at plenary and passed it.\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the bill had given sufficient and clear definition to the modes of primary election now adopted by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe re-amendment was sequel to a motion on \u201crescission on clause 84 of the Electoral Act No. 26 2010 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and Committal to the Committee of the Whole.\u201d The motion was sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe amended bill provides in clause 84 (2), \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or consensus.\u201d\n\nIt adds in 84(3), \u201cA political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election in its constitution, guidelines, or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nOn direct primaries in 84 (4), the amended version provides, \u201cA political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of presidential primaries, all registered members of the party shall vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the federation.\n\n\u201c(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) above of this subsection shall be adopted for direct primaries in respect of gubernatorial, senatorial, federal and state constituencies.\n\n\u201c(c) Special Conventions or Congresses shall be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nIn terms of indirect primaries, the bill provides under 84(5), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below: (a) In the case of nominations to the position of presidential candidate, the political party shall \u2013 (i) hold a Special Presidential Convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party where delegates shall vote for aspirants of their choice.\n\n\u201c(ii) the aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the presidential primaries of the political party and that aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIt further provides under 84(7), \u201cWhere there is only one aspirant or a consensus candidate in a political party for any of the elective positions mentioned in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) and (d), the party shall convene a special convention or congress at a designated centre on a specified date for the confirmation of such aspirant and the name of the aspirant shall be forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Bill provides in 84(8), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rule the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress meeting.\u201d\n\nOn consensus candidate, the bill in 84(9)(a) provides, \u201cA political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nIt states further in paragraph (b), \u201cWhere a political party is unable to secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective positions.\u201d\n\nThe bill states in paragraph (c), \u201cA Special Convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, explained during plenary that the leadership of the House met on Monday and decided that to facilitate speedy passage of the bill and deepen democracy, both chambers of the National Assembly decided to add the consensus provision. Gbajabiamila, however, said the inclusion came with certain provisos so as to protect all aspirants for all positions, and give all an even playing field.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that this House last week, as soon as we returned, looked into the complaints and added the provision of indirect primaries to our law. Unfortunately, the Senate added both indirect and consensus, which necessitated the possible need for a conference committee of both chambers.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the House met yesterday and decided that in the interest of speedy passage and also to deepen our democracy, the House and Senate decided to add the consensus provision, so there will be no need for conference but with certain provisos.\u201d\n\nBriefing journalists shortly after plenary, the House spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, said the bill would be transmitted to Buhari within seven days and hopefully he would look at it as quickly as possible.\n\nThe speaker said though the lawmakers included the consensus option, it did not mean political godfathers would seat in a room, prepare a list and call it consensus. He added that anyone who went against the provisions, as stipulated in the bill, could be taken to court.\n\nKalu said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the way it used to be before, that political godfathers will sit in a room and then prepare a list and call it consensus.

          "text": "\u2022Seeks 18 months suspension, to send PIA amendment to N\u2019Assembly\n\n\u2022 FG says decision has nothing to do with 2023 elections\n\n\u2022IMF insists on end, wants funds channeled to health, social devt\n\n\u2022 NLC: Why we suspended nationwide protest\n\n\u2022LCCI calls for phased implementation, NACCIMA seeks wider consultation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nThe federal government finally failed in its efforts to remove the highly contentious subsidy on petrol yesterday when it disclosed plan to recommend an 18-month extension of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to the National Assembly.\n\nThis clearly means that the burden of the policy which has been described as a major drain and waste of resources would be shifted to the next administration from May 29, 2023, if the National Assembly approves an extension of the PIA\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe government\u2019s inability to take the tough decision on the subsidy issue is bound to have massive consequence on the overall implementation of the PIA.\n\nThe implementation of the PIA which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy ought to be in February 2022 and was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threats of protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the decision was on Monday suspended.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said the president graciously okayed the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy until further notice.\n\nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday reiterated the need for Nigeria to remove subsidies on petrol and channel such funds to health, social development and other critical sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also announced the suspension of its nationwide protest.\n\nThis was just as the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has advised the federal government to adopt a phased removal approach to the dilemma it was facing over the subsidy issue and the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) called for wider consultation on the matter.\n\nAccording to Sylva, the executive would propose 18 months extension to National Assembly for the implementation of the PIA.\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, Sylva said: \u201cWe also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18 months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the national Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law. Mr. President already proposed some amendment.\n\n\u201cNow we are going to propose this amendment. There might be other amendments that will be proposed because that is the way the law is; we will continue to adjust it as we see fit, as we operate it.\u201d\n\nThe minister explained that the suspension of the subsidy removal was to give all stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation was carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the planned removal.\n\nThe modalities, he said, included getting the refineries to work, introducing an alternate fuel for cars in form of auto gas and possible palliatives for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol in accordance with extant laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n\u201cThis extension will give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the petrol subsidy removal in line with prevailing economic realities.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll those structures are not right now in place. One of those is to ensure that the refineries are working and you\u2019re all aware that steps are being taken for all the refineries to be functional very soon. The Dangote Refinery is expected to come on stream at the end of this year.\n\n\u201cAll our refineries, the Port Harcourt Refinery is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity, by end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on steam later this year.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re also aware that the rehabilitation of the refineries are ongoing, I already said that. Dangote Refinery is already on, we are hoping that by the end of this year, the refineries will be functional, at least to a great extent, not necessarily the nameplate capacity, Port Harcourt Refineries especially, will be producing. We are also expecting that Dangote Refinery will also have come on stream,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking further he said: \u201cAlso, there is discussion of introducing an alternate fuel for cars in the form of auto gas and somebody asked, what has happened since launching. A lot has gone on there, in fact, even today, if you had noticed, I briefed Mr. President on the progress that has been made on auto gas. We are hoping that in March or April, the conversion processes will begin.\n\n\u201cWe promised that one million cars will be converted initially, and of course, the corresponding amount of gas filling stations will also be built. That is in progress and I want to assure you that it will happen very soon. That also has to be in place before we say okay, we want to take out subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking at palliatives. The Minister of Finance and her team are looking at possible palliatives for Nigerians as well. So, because all these have to converge before we announce the complete removal of subsidy, because Mr. President, especially wants us to ensure that this doesn\u2019t have too much impact on the people, we are now extending the time for subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cI will not want to specifically mention the time of extension because that will be a product of a discussion with the National Assembly, because it is likely to involve an amendment of the PIA to extend extended time and I always do not want to preempt what timeframe the National Assembly will allow. But definitely at this moment, fuel subsidy removal is not on the card.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the likely effect of the subsidy removal on livelihoods of the poor, the Minister said: \u201cThe President assures that his administration will continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn queues at petrol stations that had resurfaced, he advised Nigerians to stop hoarding fuel nor engage in panic buying as government has no plans remove subsidy, Sylva said: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to remove subsidy now. That is why we are making this announcement.\u201d\n\nAsked if the suspension has anything to do with 2023 general elections, he said: \u201cOf course not. It\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr. President especially wants certain structures to in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria. That is the President\u2019s insistence. So we are now taking steps to ensure that these processes are in place.\u201d\n\nThe minister also assured that government would continue to engage the labour unions on the fuel subsidy issue saying, \u201cwe are already talking with labour, and our discussion with labour is also around this palliatives and mitigations.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEngagement with labour, of course, this will continue. This is an ongoing process; we want to start. We\u2019ve been engaging labour for a long time, if you are aware and that engagement will be ongoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a development process and maybe by July 2022, we\u2019ll be able to get back to you and give you additional developments from here.\n\n\u201cSo all these will have to come together. That\u2019s why we decided at this time, especially since we are running against time, with the legal timeframe approaching very quickly, we thought we should come to you and let you know that we are taking steps to amend the law and to ensure that we are within the law.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase in fuel price the, Sylva said: \u201cGradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table.\u201d\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis of documents from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) showed that between January and December 2021, the federal government spent over N1.43 trillion on what it terms under-recovery on petrol.\n\nA breakdown of the various payments last year, indicated that the subsidy burden has increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February 2021, to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nFurthermore, in May, the NNPC removed N126 billion as subsidy, while June came next with N164.3 billion. In July, the analysis showed that N103.2 billion was spent on under-recovery.\n\nHitherto, August had last year\u2019s lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, but was overtaken by the deduction in November of N200 billion, while September\u2019s deduction stood at N149.28 billion and the October figure was N163.709 billion, before the highest deductible amount yet of N270 billion in December.\n\nNigeria has not been able to reap the full benefits of rising international oil prices, which is now about $88 per barrel because it doesn\u2019t refine a drop of the fuel it consumes locally.\n\n\u201cOur refineries, the Port Harcourt refinery, is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity by the end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on stream later this year,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nIMF Urges Nigeria to Remove Subsidy, Channel Funds to Health, Social Devt\n\nThe IMF has stressed the need for Nigeria to remove petrol subsidy and channel such funds to the health and social development sectors.\n\nThe Washington-based institution gave the advice in response to a THISDAY question during a media briefing on its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO).\n\nThe IMF however left its 2022 economic growth projection for Nigeria at 2.7 per cent, but raised the country\u2019s 2023 growth projection from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, which represented a 0.1 percentage points increase.\n\nThe Division Chief, Research Department, IMF, Mr. Malhar Nabar, said: \u201cIn terms of subsidy, we have for long not just for Nigeria, but for many low-income countries that have these programme of subsidy schemes in place, called for scaling back of poorly targeted subsidies to create fiscal space that can then be repurposed for meeting vital health and social spending needs. That recommendation applies in the case of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Nigeria\u2019s growth projection, he said: \u201cWe have an unchanged growth projection for Nigeria for 2022 and this reflects offsetting effects that we had a slightly stronger outcome in the second half of last year, especially in the non-oil sector and this this momentum is expected to continue into 2022.\n\n\u201cBut now with the external headwinds with the impacts of Omicron, we do expect some drag going forward which will counterbalance a strong momentum going into this year.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he noted that Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was low which if properly harnessed could put the country on a path to sustainable recovery.\n\nNabar added: \u201cIn terms of the debt situation, among low-income countries, Nigeria in terms of its public debt to GDP ratio, is actually relatively on the low side compared to other low-income countries.\n\n\u201cSo, going forward, that is certainly providing a little bit more space to provide the needed support for combating the health emergency and also putting Nigeria on the path to a sustainable recovery.\u201d\n\nNLC: Why We Suspended Protest\n\nThe labour movement said it\u2019s decision to suspend the protest was based on the policy reversal by the government which was formally communicated to it on Monday.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after a virtual National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the NLC yesterday, its President, Mr. Ayuba Wabba said: \u201cNEC after vigorous debates took a decision to suspend the planned nationwide protest scheduled for 27\u2033 January 2022 and the national protest scheduled for 2\u2033 February 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said NEC met Tuesday morning virtually to consider the new position of the government and that at the end of the meeting, it resolved to suspend the protest and to direct the state chapters and all affiliates to discontinue mobilisation for the protest.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the peak of very rigorous mobilisation of Nigerians by the NLC and a host of her civil society allies, the government through the Minister of Finance yesterday, 24\u201d January 2022 made a public announcement reversing the plans to increase petrol pump price.\n\n\u201cThe position of the government was also officially communicated to the Congress with calls for further engagement. Following the reversal and reapproach by government, the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress met this morning virtually to consider the new position of the government.\u201d\n\nWabba said going forward, labour would continue to engage with the government on the very critical issues of ensuring local refining of petroleum, creation of sustainable jobs and affordable price of petrol for Nigerian workers and people.\n\nWhen asked about the steps labour would take to ensure that federal government does not renege on its pledge to shelve the policy on removal of fuel subsidy, Wabba said organised labour has a traditional of holding authorities accountable to their words, adding that NLC and its allies would use all instruments available to them to ensure that no policy measure that is injurious to workers and their families is allowed to go unchallenged.\n\nLCCI Calls for Phased Removal of Fuel Subsidy\n\nThe LCCI urged the government to do all it could to avoid truncating the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which it said has suffered a flip-flop as some of its provisions are being suspended.\n\nThe Director General of the LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, who expressed the chamber\u2019s reaction yesterday in a statement titled: \u201cLCCI Statement on the Suspension of Fuel Subsidy Removal,\u201d said: \u201cIn the face of this dilemma, we recommend that the removal is phased and with a complement of heavy investment in critical infrastructure that supports production in the economy. More production means more job creation, poverty reduction, and improved economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must consider doing all that is possible not to truncate the implementation of the PIA 2021, which has already brought so much hope for industry watchers as a big game-changer for the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for stakeholders\u2019 consultations on addressing the implications of lapsed provisions of the Act and forging the way ahead towards the full implementation of the PIA.\u201d\n\nAlmona pointed out that the major implication of the suspension was that it would increase the 2022 national budget\u2019s deficit by N1.5 trillion and constrain the federal government to borrow more than it has projected within the fiscal year.\n\nShe said: \u201cWith a monthly payment of about N250 billion to subsidise fuel consumption, the implication is that an additional N1.5 trillion expenditure has to be provided for in the 2022 federal budget.\n\n\u201cWith additional expenditure against the projected revenue, deficit financing will be needed to support the budget expenditure. We are likely to see government borrow more than projected to finance the bloated expenditure in the face of revenue mobilization challenge.\u201d\n\nThe LCCI stated that while it supported the full implementation of the PIA and the total deregulation of the oil and gas sector, \u201cwe are not insensitive to the plight of the masses that may feel the pains of some of the provisions like the removal of fuel subsidies.\u201d\n\nNACCIMA Calls for Wider Consultation\n\nNACCIMA has described the federal government\u2019s suspension of the implementation of fuel subsidy removal as a welcomed development, adding that it was not surprised by the development.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe acknowledge government\u2019s dilemma and difficulties for an enduring solution to the issue of removal of petroleum subsidy especially the prices of PMS. This decision to move the date and suspend subsidy removal beyond June is therefore not surprising. It appears as kicking the can down the road again. It is a welcome development.\n\n\u201cOn one hand is the issue of problem of relieving itself of the onerous burden of a burgeoning petrol subsidy. On the other hand, is how to come up with commensurate benefits to cushion the effect of removal of subsidy on the people or economy at large.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, said yesterday that, \u201cit is absolutely necessary to consider a practical and acceptable implementation plan in the quest to gradually weaning the public off petrol subsidy and cushion the impact with appropriate palliatives.\n\n\u201cThis can only be done in consultation with organised labour and other stakeholders including the private sector. Such an implementation plan must take into account appropriate timing aligned with the MTEF of government, as well as other concerns related to security.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important that all efforts must be made not to overheat the polity either by commission or omission especially as we move ahead to an election year. We need a peaceful Nigeria for businesses to thrive, and attract foreign investment. The decision to temporise on subsidy removal, such as contemplated by government, deserves support and we hope this step will give the required time for extensive and wide consultation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, in another act of desperation on Wednesday hosted officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission to a lavish dinner at the Government House in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, ahead of the All Progressives Congress primary election slated for Thursday (today).\n\nIn photographs exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, the INEC officials could be seen fraternising with the governor and other Ekiti government officials at the event while being treated to sumptous meals.\n\n\u201cINEC officials were hosted to a dinner by Fayemi at the Government House. Today\u2019s primary seems compromised already,\u201d a top source said in reference to the development.\n\nRecall that SaharaReporters had on January 24, 2022 exposed how Governor Fayemi paid N1.2billion to members of the APC Primary Election Committee for the state to ensure that his \u2018anointed\u2019 candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, a former Secretary to Ekiti State Government, emerged representative of the party ahead of the June 18, 2022 election.\n\nFayemi had earlier mounted pressure on Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, who heads the APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to replace Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State with Jigawa State governor, Badaru Abubakar, as chairman of the Primary Election Committee.\n\nThe plan to replace Governor Sule, who was put forward by Minister of Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, with Badaru created apprehension among APC members in Ekiti but at the end the party danced to the tune of Fayemi by announcing the latter as head of the committee.\n\nVictor Olabomtan will serve as the committee\u2019s secretary, while Kafilat Ogbara, Julius Ogunro, Tayo Adewakun, Lanre Issa Onilu and Mohammed Bamanga will all serve as members.\n\nNamed on the Primary Election Appeal Committee are Tijani Musa Tumsah (chairman), Hadiza Bala Usman (secretary), Niyi Akinsiju (member), Ogaga Ifowodo (member), and Aisha Aliyu (member).\n\nTop sources within the party had told SaharaReporters that Fayemi, who cannot run for another term as governor of Ekiti having previously completed one four-year term, doled out the N1.2billion to buy over the committee members and pave the way for Oyebanji to emerge as APC governorship candidate and eventually succeed him in office.\n\n\u201cFayemi has already bought over the committee; he splashed N1.2billion on members to ensure his candidate emerges at the end of the exercise.\n\n\u201cYou can see the list released on Monday by the party, Jigawa State governor was named as chairman exactly the way Fayemi wanted it. So, things are going according to his plan,\u201d one of the sources had said.\n\nHowever, some APC members in Ekiti, who are not happy about the development, had vowed to work against the interest of the party if Oyebanji was imposed on them by Governor Fayemi.",

Today\u2019s primary seems compromised already,\u201d a top source said in reference to the development.\n\nRecall that SaharaReporters had on January 24, 2022 exposed how Governor Fayemi paid N1.2billion to members of the APC Primary Election Committee for the state to ensure that his \u2018anointed\u2019 candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, a former Secretary to Ekiti State Government, emerged representative of the party ahead of the June 18, 2022 election.\n\nFayemi had earlier mounted pressure on Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, who heads the APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to replace Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State with Jigawa State governor, Badaru Abubakar, as chairman of the Primary Election Committee.\n\nThe plan to replace Governor Sule, who was put forward by Minister of Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, with Badaru created apprehension among APC members in Ekiti but at the end the party danced to the tune of Fayemi by announcing the latter as head of the committee.\n\nVictor Olabomtan will serve as the committee\u2019s secretary, while Kafilat Ogbara, Julius Ogunro, Tayo Adewakun, Lanre Issa Onilu and Mohammed Bamanga will all serve as members.\n\nNamed on the Primary Election Appeal Committee are Tijani Musa Tumsah (chairman), Hadiza Bala Usman (secretary), Niyi Akinsiju (member), Ogaga Ifowodo (member), and Aisha Aliyu (member).\n\nTop sources within the party had told SaharaReporters that Fayemi, who cannot run for another term as governor of Ekiti having previously completed one four-year term, doled out the N1.2billion to buy over the committee members and pave the way for Oyebanji to emerge as APC governorship candidate and eventually succeed him in office.\n\n\u201cFayemi has already bought over the committee; he splashed N1.2billion on members to ensure his candidate emerges at the end of the exercise.\n\n\u201cYou can see the list released on Monday by the party, Jigawa State governor was named as chairman exactly the way Fayemi wanted it. So, things are going according to his plan,\u201d one of the sources had said.\n\nHowever, some APC members in Ekiti, who are not happy about the development, had vowed to work against the interest of the party if Oyebanji was imposed on them by Governor Fayemi.",

          "text": "Some civil society organisations have condemned the eviction threat issued by the Rivers State Government Task Force to members of waterfront communities in the Diobu axis of Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nThe civil societies include: Collaborative Media Advocacy Platform; Social Action; Nigerian Slum/ Informal Settlement; Justice and Empowerment Initiatives; Center for Environment, Human Rights, and Development (CEHRD); Environmental Rights Action/ Friends of the Earth.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday sent to SaharaReporters, the groups said 60,000 Nigerians were at risk of being homeless peradventure the task force made good its threat.\n\nAccording to the groups, not only will the people be made homeless, they will also be driven into poverty by loss of livelihoods and other hardships associated with homelessness and displacement.\n\nThey further argued that people in the communities are employed in legitimate businesses, who also contribute positively to the economy of the state. The groups said their inability to afford the housing units in the main cities drive them to the waterfront.\n\nThis was in reference to Governor Wike's crackdown on \u201cidentified criminal hideouts\u201d in Port Harcourt Township and the Illoabuchi axis of Diobu in his 2022 New Year\u2019s address.\n\nThe civil societies said, \u201cOn 19 January, 2022, a Rivers State Government Task Force visited several waterfront communities in the Diobu axis of Port Harcourt, arbitrarily marked homes for demolition and told residents they should vacate within 7 days, that is by 26 January 2022.\n\n\u201cShould the government proceed with its threats, over 60,000 persons will be rendered homeless and driven into poverty by loss of livelihoods and other hardships associated with homelessness and displacement.\n\n\u201cWe, the undersigned communities and members of civil society, decry this unlawful and callous threat and call for the Rivers State Government to seriously reconsider its plans before it takes irreversible action that violates the fundamental human rights of 60,000 persons and undermines the security and long-term development goals of all residents of Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cAny person that has witnessed the horrors of forced eviction, where persons are thrown out of their homes and have their livelihoods and communities destroyed overnight, cannot believe this is the path to the security and development of our society. Studies have shown the terrible long-term impacts of forced evictions on the incomes, health, and education of evictees.\n\n\u201cWe understand that His Excellency, Governor Wike, declared a crackdown on \u201cidentified criminal hideouts\u201d in Port Harcourt Township and the Illoabuchi axis of Diobu in his 2022 New Year\u2019s address \u2013 a vague menace that has resulted in fear among waterfront communities that have seen previous administrations use scaremongering and smear campaigns to justify forced evictions of waterfront communities like Agip (2004/05), Njemanze (2009) and Abonnema Wharf (2012).\n\n\u201cIndeed, Diobu-axis waterfront communities joined hands on 7 January 2022 to write to the Governor to express their concerns and request an urgent audience with the Governor to discuss how to address security concerns and otherwise seek win-win partnership as an alternative to eviction and demolition.\n\n\u201cYet, till date, there has been no positive response to these appeals. Meanwhile, the reality is that the demolitions being threatened do not target specific criminals or criminal hideouts; instead, they are a pretext for evicting thousands of innocent children, women, men, and elderly persons who are employed in legitimate businesses through which they eke out modest livings, and from which they pay their children\u2019s school fees and government taxes.\n\n\u201cWe know the communities under threat are ready to work with government in any legitimate law enforcement approach to resolving security concerns and rooting out criminals who may be hiding in different corners of the city.\n\n\"Should the government proceed with the evictions threated on 19 January 2022, over 60,000 more Nigerians will be forced out of their homes and businesses and communities.\n\n\u201dWe are deeply concerned that the government would run roughshod over all these rights in the present-day democratic dispensation; we call for a break from the past of such abuses and for the government to partner with us \u2013 communities and civil society \u2013 to find a better way forward.\u201d",

          "title": "He built TikTok's strategy in Africa, now he's building Kippa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nTikTok made huge waves when it announced its sponsorship of the African Cup of Nations, the continent\u2019s biggest football tournament. Kennedy Ekezie-Joseph who helped lead TikTok\u2019s entry into Africa, was no longer with the company for that moment of triumph. Instead, he was grinding away at a new startup. Big mistake? Maybe not.\n\nLeaving a budding career at social networking behemoth that has big ambitions on your home continent, to launch a startup, sounds like a suicidal move. But for Ekezie-Joseph, 23, who was part of a small group that led TikTok\u2019s foray into Africa and was well-positioned to benefit from the company\u2019s continental ambitions, it actually wasn\u2019t. That much became clear when his startup attracted record seed funding.\n\nEkezie-Joseph\u2019s startup, Kippa, is a bookkeeping and finance app that he founded with Duke Ekezie (his brother) and Jephthah Uche in February 2021. It has had a meteoric trajectory since its launch in June.\n\nIn November, the startup hauled in $3.2 million in pre-seed funding, arguably one of the largest early-stage fund-raises in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile phone and Whatsapp-friendly, Kippa targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SME\u2019s) providing them with free, easy-to-use accounting software. Kippa then looks at potential financing opportunities and makes revenue by taking commission fees and earning interest by lending companies working capital.\n\nTo date, more than a billion dollars in transactions have been recorded by the platform, according to the founders.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today, there are 47 million SMEs, according to SMED Analyst statistics out there. About 280,000 merchants out of that number, have used the product. And our goal is over the next five to 10 years to capture as much of that number as possible, by building out new features, by launching new product lines,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said in an interview with bird.\n\nAs a child, Ekezie-Joseph saw first-hand how the absence of judicious record-keeping could impact fragile and shock-prone micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a small business around when I was born, which he lost. And so for me, it really means a lot to build for a segment that I feel very intimately familiar with,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nF-R: Duke, Japhthah, and Kennedy, co-founders of Kippa\n\nKippa (a play on book\u201dkeeper\u201d) is a bookkeeping mobile app that allows small business owners to keep track of their daily income and expense transactions, issue invoices, provide receipts to their customers and create marketing materials like business cards.\n\nThe app also keeps track of debtors who owe the subscriber companies money.\n\nWhen he launched Kippa, Ekezie-Joseph knew from personal experience that he was addressing an existential threat to businesses. This gave him and his team confidence.\n\nTrue to their projection, Kippa was an instant hit at launch, striking a chord with thousands of SMEs in Nigeria, underlining the opportunities and the demand for this particular service.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, SMEs have been laggers when it comes to the adoption of digital technology. What we\u2019ve seen is digital technology has changed very many other industries \u2013 healthcare, transport \u2013 but the way businesses are run and the overall back-office operations are still very manual, they\u2019ve really not changed since the 60s,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do here is unite the tailwind of the deep penetration of the internet that is continuing to grow across the continent and the smartphone penetration. So by 2025, Nigeria alone will contribute 4 per cent of total new smartphone users in the world. And we think that\u2019s such an exciting deal in that, companies like us are building on the back of to provide tools that business owners can use on these devices that they have.\u201d\n\nKennedy Ekezie-Joseph presented with a Queen\u2019s Young Leaders Award in 2018 for his work in promoting women\u2019s rights in the areas of female genital mutilation (FGM), domestic abuse and forced child marriage and access to education for girls.\n\nEkezie-Joseph and his team are now planning another round of fundraising to scale the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cSo we will be talking to investors over the next couple of months. And one of the big things we believe in is building relationships early and taking time to identify the right partners to work with. So if we do meet investors who are the right fit, we\u2019ll be able to work with them,\u201d he said.\n\nEkezie-Joseph was an early recipient of the prestigious Yenching Scholarship, a masters program at the elite Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nA top Nigerian debater while still at college, as a 16-year-old college freshman, he had already begun using his voice to change his community, founding a social enterprise that worked to end the practice of female genital mutilation in communities and increase access to education for young girls.\n\nWith two TEDx talks under his belt, a Barack Obama Young African Leaders Fellowship and a Resolution Fellowship and numerous recognitions and accolades, Ekezie-Joseph has a track record of success despite his young age.\n\nA master\u2019s degree from an elite academy at Beijing\u2019s top research university must have made Ekezie-Joseph a shoo-in at TikTok, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance. He was part of the early expansion of TikTok into Africa. But the experience at a university that has given rise to some of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies and spawned dozens of top global entrepreneurs, may have also given him bigger ambitions.\n\n\u201cI was the first line here and had the team to lead our acquisition and growth for the company\u2019s expansions. Africa? We had a couple thousand users of the product, then. And you know, we\u2019ve gone from then, 2018, to today being the third-most-used social app in Africa, with tens of millions of users,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging the economic impact of COVID-19 on the continent, Ekezie-Joseph noted that it had helped fuel the growth of the tech industry and internet adoption in Africa.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time many merchants understood that they could do business online. That was the first time many consumers understood that they could transact with merchants online. So it almost helped us leapfrog the absence of trust around digital tools. And that\u2019s been super helpful. And more and more people are doing business online now. So that is very significant for our growth as a business,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the early conversion of bookkeepers and small business owners, Ekezie-Joseph is the first to admit that there are plenty of hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cTo bring the right people in the door, bring the most experienced people in the industry and have them around the table working with us pursuing the mission. And so that means bringing regulators on board, you know, people will have experience engaging with them, and industry veterans. So that is a very big one for us,\u201d he said in an interview with the bird story agency.\n\n\u02dc\u201dThe second thing is also executing on our roadmap\u2026the way we think about it last year, we built a really solid product and validated the need for it in the market. And this is truly the year we build processes around that and leverage that and we continue to build at breakneck speed for all users and establish our place in the market.\u201d\n\nSo have there been misgivings over leaving TikTok?\n\n\u201cNo! The plan was always to eventually move back to Nigeria and build a startup and the onset of the pandemic in China, gave me the perfect reason to make the move back and take the leap,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nShare this article",

AI supercomputers are an improved version of supercomputers that can carry out more calculations per second than regular supercomputers, using the same hardware.\n\n\u201cRSC will help Meta\u2019s AI researchers build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyse text, images and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and more,\u201d the company explained in a blog post.\n\nWith more than 2.6 billion monthly active users, Meta\u2019s Facebook is the most popular social media in the world. In Africa, Meta\u2019s suite of social messaging tools\u2014Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp\u2014serve as the internet for hundreds of millions of people. Businesses and consumers depend heavily on these messaging platforms because its use is ubiquitous and access to these apps and sites are free or discounted on many African telecom networks.\n\nRSC is expected to aid Meta in identifying harmful content on Facebook and Instagram; processing larger and longer videos with higher sampling rates; and in developing new augmented reality tools. It\u2019s a valuable tool that\u2019ll aid Meta in accomplishing its plans to move billions of users into the Metaverse in the near future.\n\nBefore this announcement, Meta has been using the first generation of the supercomputer designed in 2017, which could design 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster that performs 35,000 training jobs a day.\n\nRealising the need to accelerate progress, work on the RSC began in early 2020, with Meta engineers designing and building a new AI supercomputer system from ground up.\n\n\u201cRSC today comprises a total of 760 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems as its compute nodes, for a total of 6,080 GPUs\u2014with each A100 GPU being more powerful than the V100 used in the previous system,\u201d the company said.\n\nCompared to the first generation of Meta\u2019s supercomputer, early benchmarks on RSC show that it \u201cruns computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster, runs the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) more than nine times faster, and trains large-scale NLP models three times faster. That means a model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks, compared with nine weeks before,\u201d Meta said.\n\n\n\nAware of privacy concerns, the company added that RSC has been designed from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. Meta\u2019s researchers can safely train models using encrypted user-generated data that is not decrypted until right before training.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater. Earth. Fire. Air.\n\nIf you are an Avatar: The Last Airbender head like me, you are probably expecting to see the following tagline, \u201cLong ago, the four nations\u2026\u201d\n\nAll in due time, my friend. But please, follow closely.\n\nOn Monday, August 29, 2005, the historic storm, Hurricane Katrina, hit cities lined up on the Louisiana-Mississippi border in New Orleans. For many, that was the last time they saw their homes and over 1,000 lives were lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Boxing Day in 2004, the world\u2019s third-largest earthquake occurred, resulting in one of the worst natural disasters \u2014 The Asian Tsunami. An estimated 227,898 people died in 14 countries on the coastline, including India, Indonesia, and Thailand.\n\nSo, why the Avatar reference and what does it mean here? The original idea was to list different natural disasters, but I felt that all four elements play a vital role in these situations. Water: tsunamis and earthquakes; Earth: the world; Air: tornadoes and earthquakes; and Fire: the aftermath.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nA common ground connecting both disasters is the major focus of this article. But before that, why mention the disasters in the first place? What is the connection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both situations, the NigeriaSat-1, built by the UK\u2019s Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) in 2003, was the first satellite to send images of the US east coast after Hurricane Katrina. It also provided valuable images for aid workers following the Asian Tsunami.\n\nBefore being decommissioned in 2014 as part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation, NigeriaSat-1 was used to respond to floods in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and West Africa. It has also been used for various mapping campaigns like the Amazon and Vietnam\u2019s coastal areas.\n\nNigeria does have other satellites, and they\u2019ve been used in different situations, but before that, let\u2019s do some backtracking.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nA history of Nigeria\u2019s space programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\u2019s space station in Kano \u2014 one of 18 Project Mercury space stations strategically placed along the Earth\u2019s orbital track. The stations were part of a vast global communication network necessary to track spacecraft and relay information back to Mercury Control Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA. Source: Globalvoices\n\nNigeria\u2019s space history is a long and chequered one. Few people know \u2014 or remember \u2014 that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) built the first satellite earth station in Nigeria, the NASA Tracking Station 5, in 1961 in Kano to monitor the Gemini and Apollo space missions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the station was closed in 1963 before both missions were concluded in 1966 and 1972, respectively.\n\nIn 1976, at an ECOWAS meeting held in Addis Ababa, Nigeria first declared its space ambition, and it took 23 years to set up a space agency. In May 1999, the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) was born following the recommendation of a nine-person committee of experts constituted by the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI).\n\nSide note: NASENI was established in 1992 by the Nigerian federal government on the recommendations of the White Paper Committee on the 1991 Report of a 150-member National Committee on Engineering Infrastructure comprising scientists, engineers, administrators, federal and state civil servants, economists, lawyers, bankers, and industrialists.\n\nNASRDA\u2019s mandate is to \u201cvigorously pursue the attainment of space capabilities as an essential tool for the socio-economic development and the enhancement of the quality of life of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe agency is under the purview of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria\u2019s space programme is managed by NASRDA. And in 2000, the National Space Policy (NSP) was approved, and a 25-year roadmap for its implementation was endorsed in 2005. But we\u2019ll get to those in a bit.\n\nIn 2006, the state-owned Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited was formed to manage and operate Nigeria\u2019s communication satellites under the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy.\n\nIn its 15 years of existence, the company, a limited liability enterprise that is yet to turn a profit, does not have an establishing Act and has been the subject of controversy after recently claiming it would acquire two new satellites in 2023 and 2025.\n\nIt also has a subsidiary, GeoApps Plus Limited, which is expected to handle the sale of satellite images acquired by Nigeria\u2019s earth observation satellites. According to its Facebook page, it provides training in Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing for Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), and the military, among others.\n\nIn 2017, after the Defence Space Administration Act was passed into law, and following the suggestions of the NSP, the Defence Space Administration (DSA) was officially commissioned to acquire more space science technologies to aid the military.\n\nFormerly known as the Defence Space Agency, the DSA was first established on October 9, 2014, and is currently training several engineers in partnership with NIGCOMSAT and NASRDA.\n\nBut there\u2019s still a lot to unpack from the NSP and we\u2019ll be taking a look soon.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nWhat Nigeria\u2019s National Space Policy looks like\n\nAs we found out in 2018, as with most countries, Nigeria\u2019s space programme is shrouded in secrecy.\n\nBy some stroke of luck and a dedicated LinkedIn search, I found the profile of Dr Halilu Ahmad Shaba, NASRDA DG, who agreed to talk to me for this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Halilu Ahmad, Director-General. NASRDA\n\nI asked him what kind of policies we might expect under his tenure, and while he didn\u2019t tell me, he said one thing for certain, the NSP will be reviewed. A task that would be done alongside the overhaul of the current roadmap, which President Muhammadu Buhari has sanctioned.\n\nBut while we await the review, we can visit the current policy.\n\nThe NSP is a ten-chapter document outlining several objectives like defence and law enforcement, disaster prediction, earth observation, poverty alleviation, promotion of international cooperation, and the establishment of research centres.\n\nIt also provides Nigeria\u2019s space economic model, a public-private partnership that involves short, medium, and long-term plans.\n\nShort-term, the government is responsible for all investments in space technology development.\n\nMedium-term, the government implements the partial commercialisation of NASRDA\u2019s products and services developed during the short-term economic development plan.\n\nLong-term, the government partners with the private sector to implement the public-private partnership framework for the space programme.\n\nTo achieve this, the roadmap contains benchmarks:\n\nLaunch of NigeriaSat-1 by 2002\n\nTraining of Nigerian engineers to build earth observation (EO) satellites abroad by 2006\n\nLaunch of two new satellites by 2011\n\nTraining of Nigerian astronauts by 2015\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar by 2015\n\nDevelopment and Building of Made in Nigeria Satellites by 2018\n\nDevelopment of Rocketry/Propulsion Systems by 2025\n\nDevelopment of Spin-Off of Allied Industries \u2013 Electronics, Software etc. by 2028\n\nLarge-Scale Commercialisation of Space Technology & Know-how by 2030\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nDown the rabbit hole of implementation\n\nAs far as implementation goes, Nigeria has had some success. We already talked about NigeriaSat-1. NASRDA has also facilitated the training of engineers in building EO satellites, with the NigeriaSat-X solely built by Nigerians, alongside the Nigeria-Sat-2 launched by the SSTL in 2011.\n\nThe NigeriaSat-1 and NigeriaSat-X have a lifespan of seven years and should have deorbited in 2018. But, four years later, both are still functioning by \u201cgrace\u201d, as said by Shaba, and as an expert I spoke to told me, Nigeria is getting more value for money.\n\nIn 2017, the EduSat-1, a collaboration between the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), Ondo State, Nigeria, and NASRDA, was built by Nigerians and launched from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, but was decommissioned in 2019.\n\nAs to astronauts, you\u2019d probably remember the current Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, telling Nigerians in March 2016 that Nigeria would have an astronaut in space on or before 2030. Before then, a fraudulent email about a Nigerian astronaut stranded in space had circulated, eliciting varying reactions. However, Shaba confirms that this milestone has not been achieved.\n\nNigeria\u2019s dream to launch in space by 2030 does not look any closer to reality. As of 2021, 44 satellites have been launched by 14 African countries, but none have been done from an African launch site.\n\nAs of 2019, the Centre for Space Transport and Propulsion (CSTP), Epe, Lagos State, has completed three successful experimental rocket launches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentre for Space Transport and Propulsion (CSTP), Epe, Lagos State, completed three successful experimental rocket launches in 2019. Source: Space in Africa\n\nBut, due to the hushed nature of Nigeria\u2019s space programme, we only know a previous milestone altitude of 10km before 2019. Although Shaba says it has increased since then.\n\n\u201cBecause it can also be used for utility purposes, we made a case that we are not going to announce that. So we closed it to the public and only made some skeletal speeches about that.\u201d\n\nCommunication satellites\n\nOne vital aspect of space technology is communication satellites. Although they may not provide as fast Internet speeds as subsea cables or be as reliable, in a country like Nigeria where broadband penetration is as low as 41%, any little thing helps.\n\nCurrently, however, satellites only contribute 0.2% to Nigeria\u2019s Internet connectivity.\n\nAfter the NigeriaSat-1\u2019s successful launch, in 2004, the government contracted state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corporation Limited (CGWIC) to build the NigComSat-1, a communication satellite.\n\nThe NigComSat-1 was launched in 2007, but due to an anomaly in its solar array, which meant it did not have enough power, it was shut down in 2008. Thankfully, the Nigerian government had a failsafe insurance policy that enabled them to contract CGWIC again to build the NigComSat-1R.\n\nThe NigComat-1R was launched in 2011 and has a 15-year life span, and, just like its predecessor, was managed by NIGCOMSAT. It had the exact specifications as the NigComSat-1, seeing that it was a replacement.\n\nIn 2018, Reuters reported that Nigeria had agreed to a $550 million deal with the CGWIC once again for two communication satellites which were to be ready by 2020 and 2021. But there\u2019s no accurate information as to whether the deal pushed through or not. Especially after the world\u2019s focus moved to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShaba, however, calls this move and the current one by NIGCOMSAT to contract new satellites as counterproductive to what has already been done by NASRDA in training engineers and building satellites.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have two satellite manufacturing agencies. And NIGCOMSAT is [a] communications limited, and we said it should restrict itself to transpondence.\u201d\n\nSide note: Transpondence is the receiving, sending, or reciprocal actions of receiving and sending messages or information through transponders or one of various radio transmission devices.\n\nCommercialisation of space tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Temidayo Onisosun, Founder, Space in Africa, an Africa-focused media, analytics, and consulting firm focusing on the space and satellite industry, explained, the space ecosystem is divided into upstream and downstream.\n\nLike upstream companies in the oil and gas sector, space startups specialise in exploration and drilling. In the space ecosystem, this could mean rocket or satellite launching or space missions.\n\nA company downstream would be more focused on remote sensing, communication, among others. Currently, Nigeria\u2019s space ecosystem is mostly government run, especially in upstream activities.\n\nTo aid its 2030 goal of large scale commercialisation, in 2010, the NASRDA Act was passed, establishing the National Space Council (NSC) as regulator. The Act says the NSC can approve licences for space activities in Nigeria. It, however, makes no provision for private partnership, thus limiting private companies to a participatory role.\n\nAccording to Shaba, as part of Nigeria\u2019s medium-term goals, NASRDA\u2019s products are to be commercialised.\n\n\u201cWe try to call them and let them know. For example, if data is supposed to cost 30 million, we sell it at 25 million. You sell it and make your money. And then you return the remaining money to the agency.\u201d\n\nThis data is information gotten from Nigeria\u2019s available satellites.\n\nShaba also mentioned spin-offs from its Quick Win projects, which focused on specific issues like food security, human security, disaster management, climate change, data management, and educational packages in space science.\n\nThis included research done on the effect of high-frequency radiation on Wistar rats. A study which was to help the Agency determine the former on humans. Although it is not clear what this new research brings to the table as it appears to be a well-researched field. But, of course, science is always a curiosity.\n\nIn 2020, there were 23 Quick Win projects.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nNotable achievements by NASRDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most Nigerians, in a country heavily hit by recession and facing continued insecurity, a space programme looks like vanity metrics, showboating, if you will. But space technology is quite important.\n\nAccording to Statista, in 2020, the global space economy made approximately $446.9 billion, increasing from $428 billion in the previous year, with commercial space products and services accounting for almost 50% of the total turnover.\n\nBut beyond the economic impact, there are spillovers into other sectors, like agriculture, medicine, transport, the environment, and communications.\n\nOver the last few years, NASRDA has worked with Nigerian and foreign military agencies to eliminate insurgency in West Africa.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the Agency used the NigeriaSat-X to produce a 10-metre digital elevation simulation map and vegetation density map of Sambisa Forest to help the military in the insurgency fight.\n\nBasically, using data obtained from the satellite, NASRDA created a digital representation of the forest.\n\nIn 2012, NASRDA aided the Malian government during the civil war between Southern and Northern factions.\n\nThe media house also says, \u201cthe space agency donated over 4000 satellite images estimated to be worth \u20a63 billion ($8.3 million) to Nigerian universities and research institutions, using NigeriaSat-1 alone. In all, NigeriaSat-1 directly contributed over \u20a610.5 billion ($29 million) to Nigeria\u2019s economy within its first nine years in orbit.\u201d\n\nThese activities were also continued using the newer satellites, the NigeriaSat-2 and NigeriaSat-X.\n\nIn 2015, NIGCOMSAT won the contract to manage Belarus\u2019 satellite, the BelinterSat-1, a revenue source which was estimated would bring in $400,000 annually.\n\nCombining these with the Quick Win projects and several other spin-offs, it would appear the Agency has not completely failed.\n\nHowever, although Shaba describes the Nigerian space ecosystem as \u201cvibrant\u201d, the country still lags behind, a problem he attributes to funding.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nGoing back to the basics\n\nWhile I talked to Henry Ibitolu, a former Research Intern at NASRDA, he drew an interesting comparison with India.\n\n\u201cIndia right now has almost joined the league of countries launching rockets. When the US government, through NASA, sent rockets to Mars, they spent $2 billion. But when India leveraged its local manpower and technology to land a rover on Mars, they spent $20 million. That\u2019s about 10% or less of what the US spent.\u201d\n\nI would later check the figures, and although not accurate, the numbers do say a lot. India spent $73 million and was successful on its first try.\n\nTo be fair, India\u2019s space mission was done in 2013 while the US first successful Mars landing happened in 1975; several things made it much cheaper, even by previous standards.\n\nIndia was careful to work with only local companies and engineers and made several adjustments to the technology to make it more efficient. A position made possible by an educational system that prioritises Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses.\n\nOnly two Nigerian Universities \u2014 Kwara State University, Malete, Kwara State, and recently the Lagos State University, Lagos, offer courses in aerospace and Aeronautical engineering.\n\nI also found only one university \u2014 FUTA \u2014 that teaches remote Sensing and GIS as a course separate from geomatics and surveying. Several universities also offer Masters in Remote Sensing.\n\nIbitolu said the government should invest in STEM education.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government should partner with universities to come up with innovative ideas. We have local technology that we can leverage on to make use of that.\u201d\n\nAn opinion Oniosun shares.\n\nInterestingly, all seven NASRDA research centres are situated in universities.\n\nBut beyond, education is funding. The space industry is capital intensive. I mean, we just talked about India spending $74 million for its Mars landing.\n\nIn 2021, NASRDA and its parastatals received \u20a622.8 billion ($55.6 million) \u2014 14.4% \u2014 from the total budget allocation for the Ministry of Science and Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total budgetary allocation for Nigeria\u2019s space programme was \u20a635.7 billion ($86.8 million), with NASRDA accounting for 64%, NIGCOMSAT, 22%, and DSA, 14%.\n\nTo put all of this into perspective, given the world\u2019s current fascination with Mars and using NASA\u2019s current Mars mission named Perseverance, which is expected to cost $2.7 billion, Nigeria\u2019s entire space budget is barely 2% of the total cost.\n\nA more obvious choice might be a satellite, which costs anything from $400,000 to $1 million to build.\n\nIt still leaves us with one conclusion, Nigeria\u2019s space programme is grossly underfunded.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut solution, Nigeria\u2019s best bet lies in its space economic model, the long-term plan to be precise. A public-private partnership where the government works with privately-owned companies.\n\nBut Ibitolu advises NASRDA to achieve its dream of sending an astronaut into space before taking on a more regulatory role.\n\n\u201cBefore you move to being a regulatory agency, you must have led by example. Before you tell people to do something, you must have done it yourself. But if you\u2019ve not done anything and you are telling people to do it, it\u2019s not possible. Because you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA position reminiscent of current startup woes in Nigeria.\n\nUsing the NASA-Space-X analogy, Oniosun believes NASRDA should work with universities and private companies empowering local startups.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the US government, NASA had to trust SpaceX, to innovate and do awesome stuff. Maybe Nigeria has to do that.\n\n\u201cThe Space agency has trained hundreds of persons to Masters and PHD level, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It has not done anything before, and maybe they should stop wasting their money.\n\n\u201cInstead of the Agency trying to do all of that by itself, it should trust these companies and begin to outsource its technology.\u201d\n\nBut what does the private sector look like in Nigeria?\n\nThriving or declining?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\nAccording to Ibitolu, the downstream sector is thriving with several remote sensing and GIS companies in the space. But currently, there\u2019s no private company in the upstream space.\n\nA problem that could also perhaps be attributed to the capital intensive nature of the industry, as funding remains a challenge. And Olayinka Fagbemiro, Assistant Chief Scientific Officer at NASRDA, believes banks could be the solution, most especially the African Development Bank (AfDB), but there has to be trust.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the private sector, this is an aspect that the government has to work on. Why? There has to be an enabling environment. There has to be a certain ease of doing business in that aspect that would make individuals able to commit the huge, enormous resources that need to go into the private sector and be a player in the space programme.\n\n\u201cIf banks, for example, can provide some sort of loans for startups in the space sector, there are a lot of smart, young Nigerians coming up daily with expertise, but the major challenge is capital. And Africa is losing out a whole lot as a result because Africa has a lot to gain from space products.\u201d\n\nBut it would have to be a long term investment or credit plan. However, Shaba decries Nigerian investors\u2019 eye for quick profit.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nA new age?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nIn May 2021, Shaba was appointed as the new Director-General of NASRDA, and I asked him what to expect from NASRDA under his reign. Shaba\u2019s answers: lots of restructuring, more satellites, and functioning in line with the government.\n\nIbitolu expects some changes.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we will see change with the new administration. When I did my IT with NASRDA, under the previous administration, I saw people being employed who had studied Yoruba. But we are hopeful we will see new developments at NASRDA.\u201d\n\nA position Fagbemiro agrees with.\n\nBefore writing this, I hoped to determine whether the Space Agency has failed in its duties. My conclusion is that, to a large extent, compared to other space programmes, while it cannot be regarded as a total failure, it cannot be regarded as an out and out success either.\n\nBut, it could be better.

Probably never if you are being honest.\n\nIn May 2022, Nigeria\u2019s space agency, the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), will be 23 years old. If NASRDA was a person, it would probably be done with university and serving the nation or wracking their brain over an uncompleted final year project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, in the 23 years since NASRDA was born, we\u2019ve heard so many things like satellites living on grace to a Nigerian astronaut being in space by 2030 to supposed mini rocket launches.\n\nWhat\u2019s the real story, though? And why should you even care? Ogheneruemu has been doing some digging and has some answers for you. The time is 10 a.m; you might want to set a reminder for this.\n\nOZ\u00c9\u2019s $3m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOZ\u00c9 team source: TechCrunch\n\nGhanian fintech startup, OZ\u00c9, has raised a $3m pre-Series A led by Speedinvest. Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund, Savannah Fund and some angel investors also invested. This new funding is coming after a $700k seed financing in January 2021.\n\nWhat does OZ\u00c9 do? The startup helps small businesses go from pen and paper to running their operations digitally.\n\nIt also provides basic data necessary for business growth and access to capital that can help scale or keep the business afloat. OZ\u00c9 sets itself apart from similar platforms by including business coaching and digitised payments, all in one platform.\n\nLast year, OZ\u00c9 said it saw a 1200% increase in active users, bringing total active users on the platform to 125,000.\n\nAccording to Co-Founder and COO, Dave Emmett, \u201cthe last decade has seen a huge transformation in the digitisation of business accelerated by the pandemic.\u201d\n\nEmmett said this has increased the demand for financial solutions such as accepting payments and securing loans to keep businesses running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funding will be used to increase the capabilities of OZ\u00c9 and provide accessible financing to small businesses in Ghana and Nigeria.\n\n500 solar mini-grids for Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria could be getting 500 solar mini-grids within the next five years as Husk Power Systems, a rural energy services company, has pledged to build 5000 mini-grids and establish 1 million connections in Africa and Asia.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the company revealed this pledge yesterday, January 26, 2022, at the signing of an Energy Compact with the United Nations (UN) to grow its energy market in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\n\nAn Energy Compact is a voluntary commitment to the UN by companies, member states or even NGOs to achieve clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nHow much power can solar mini-grids provide? According to the World Bank, mini-grids can provide electricity to about 500 million people, but it will cost $225 billion. It also estimates that to achieve universal electricity by 2030, 40% of electricity needs to be from mini-grids.\n\nHusk Power System\u2019s commitment could break the ice when it comes to providing electricity for Africa.

          "text": "The effect of mass migration of healthcare workers is biting harder and nudging towards an emergency situation even as top private hospitals that have pooled huge investment into operations struggle to retain skilled staff, according to BusinessDay finding.\n\nHospitals continue to face rejections despite offerings of a work setting that matches global standards, a pay level that doubles local average, or is at par with some foreign offers.\n\nVast and short experienced health workers are constantly migrating out of Nigeria even if it means little or no raise in their income. Hospitals are left to run with a constant cycle of fresh graduates who are often looking to enrich their credentials with the experience before leaving.\n\nA center manager at one of the private hospitals championing the reversal of medical tourism in Lagos informs BusinessDay that the management is considering bringing in equally skilled expatriates as a means to protect service delivery.\n\nHer hospital, for instance, lost close to 30 skilled workers between December and January, all leaving for destinations such as the UK, Canada, and the US, among others.\n\nThose who are yet to leave are actively processing their way out, taking different examinations.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in the hospital now, we are losing very skilled people and those that are available are applying to leave. I have a consultant close to 50 who earns up to N2 million monthly. He\u2019s leaving also and I can\u2019t stop him. He wants a better life for his family. A lady in patient service left for the US last week. It\u2019s so bad,\u201d she says, asking not to be mentioned.\n\nThe drought of health professionals is also hitting hard at another big private hospital with multi-specialties in one of Lagos major highbrow setups. BusinessDay understands that if the desertion continues at the current pace, the hospital\u2019s prospects of delivering world-class services could be dampened too early. It could even land in a double whammy where it struggles to keep both professionals and high-end patients from going abroad.\n\n\u201cThose you see applying for the jobs we have now are fresh out of school, and those that want to work in the health sector for one or two months to enrich their CV because it is very hard for them to get employed without work experience. We are at that point where it is either we pay our local people more money or we start importing Indians, as they are the closest to our economy,\u201d the center manager states.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigeria has a ratio of 16.1 nurses to 10,000 people and one doctor to 5,000 patients, rather than one to 600.\n\nThe trend shows top private hospitals are no longer protected from the skill drought that has been challenging many government-run facilities for decades. The Federal Government had on several occasions acknowledged the shortage of healthcare experts without substantial actions to tackle the crisis. Rather, health workers are owed several months of salary and due allowances unpaid.\n\nA real tsunami\n\nDespite that shortage and a ban on recruitment, 1,334 Nigerian trained nurses joined the UK workforce between March and September 2021, marking an all-time high, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) of the United Kingdom data indicate.\n\nPopulation growth-based projections on Nigeria from 2016 to 2030 suggest that there would be a shortage of up to 140,000 nurses and midwives in 2030, compared to 2016.\n\nThe International Council of Nurses (ICN) on Monday said about 13 million nurses would be required over the next 10 years to fix the worsening nursing shortage from mass poaching from countries, including Nigeria.\n\nThe body, representing over 27 million nurses worldwide, says it anticipates a migration tsunami as wealthier countries find a quick fix to the pandemic fallout by pooling qualified hands out of poorer countries, deepening inequalities in access to healthcare further.\n\nAttractive remuneration packages, advanced working conditions, and immigration policies targeted at easing healthcare workers\u2019 emigration have effects as baits and major drivers of brain drain in lower-middle-income countries, the ICN report shows.\n\nRead also: Emigration: The old-new rage\n\nSuch a scale of nurses\u2019 exodus in emigrating countries such as Nigeria has seen the nursing workforce grow leaner.\n\nThe report notes that global inequalities in the availability of nursing personnel are largely income-driven, with a density of 9.1 nurses per 10,000 population in low-income countries compared with 107.7 per 10,000 population in high-income economies, a tenfold variation in nurse availability.\n\nNigeria falls among the countries accounting for the largest shortages, and population growth is expected to further push up demand for nurses, irrespective of the current workforce profile.\n\nMore than 550,000 foreign-trained nurses were working across 36 OECD member countries in 2019, which was a marked increase on the 460,000 recorded in 2011, according to an OECD analysis.\n\nThe share of foreign-trained nurses has increased particularly in Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland, with a steady growth also occurring in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.\n\nThe US reports the highest number of registered international nurses, estimated at almost 197,000; the second was the UK with over 100,000 foreign-trained nurses, then Germany with 71,000, and Australia with 53,000.\n\nHoward Catton, CEO, ICN, who co-authored the report, says the findings underlined the severity of the shortages.\n\nWhile the situation was known hitherto as a persistent historical underfunding of nursing around the world, the latest information about nurse vacancies, their rates of intention to leave, and staff sickness rates is a compelling reason to now recognise the issue as a global crisis.\n\n\u201cWe already had a shortage of 6 million nurses at the start of the pandemic, but with the immense and relentless pressure of responding to COVID and the Omicron variant, and an avalanche of resignations and retirements anticipated, the world will need to recruit and retain up to 13 million nurses over the next decade,\u201d Catton states.\n\nAction agenda\n\nThe report says a long-term plan is needed to stem the tide of those leaving nursing because of the additional stresses resulting from COVID-19 and to create a new generation of nurses to grow the profession to meet the increased future demands of an aging global population.\n\nThe ICN is calling for urgent coordination of policies both at national and international levels to mitigate the effects of these shortages.\n\nAt the country level, it suggests that policy priorities are focused on ensuring adequate domestic training capacity and improving the retention of domestically trained nurses.\n\nThere also has to be increased commitment to supporting early access to full vaccination programmes for all nurses as well as all other interventions to improve sustainability risk that could be undermined without it.",
          "summary": "The effect of mass migration of healthcare workers is biting harder and nudging towards an emergency situation even as top private hospitals that have pooled huge investment into operations struggle to retain skilled staff, according to BusinessDay finding.\nVast and short experienced health workers are constantly migrating out of Nigeria even if it means little or no raise in their income.\nHer hospital, for instance, lost close to 30 skilled workers between December and January, all leaving for destinations such as the UK, Canada, and the US, among others.\n\u201cUnfortunately, in the hospital now, we are losing very skilled people and those that are available are applying to leave.\nRather, health workers are owed several months of salary and due allowances unpaid.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has said it is unwilling to inflict an additional burden on Nigerians as a major reason for the decision to suspend its petrol subsidy removal.\n\nHowever, understanding how countries in similar situations solved the problem may provide lessons for Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of studies conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the non-profit, Governance and Social Development Resource Centre, sheds light on strategies used by over a dozen countries to lessen the pain of subsidy removal.\n\nResearch\n\nSome countries succeeded in convincing their people that subsidies are harmful using independent research and proactive communication.\n\nGhana, one of Nigeria\u2019s neighbouring countries, ended subsidies on petroleum products in 2005, by employing Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA), a systematic approach to analysing the distributional impact of policy reforms and programmes on the welfare of different stakeholders groups.\n\nPSIA promotes evidence-based policy choices and fosters debate on policy reform options and it\u2019s used increasingly by governments, civil society organisations, and multilateral agencies.\n\nThrough the PSIA, Ghana found the subsidy programme was poorly targeted, with the wealthy receiving the lion\u2019s share of the benefits. It quantified how and to what extent the poor would be affected by future deregulation.\n\nThis became an important foundation for persuasively communicating the necessity for reform and for designing policies to reduce the impacts of higher fuel prices on the poor.\n\nThe PSIA in Ghana also showed that cash transfers would be more cost-effective in reaching the poor than the existing tax exemption on kerosene and the LPG subsidy. However, it must first generate an accurate list.\n\nThese arguments are true for Nigeria as only the rich in a few states benefit the most from petrol subsidies. The government is trying to fix the decrepit refineries, counting on Dangote refineries, offering cash to the poor, and propping autogas policy without research showing whether these measures would be effective or not.\n\nPublic campaigns and education\n\nCountries that have successfully removed petrol subsidies embarked on public campaigns to educate the people.\n\nIn Ghana, the finance and energy ministries undertook a public relations campaign, including a broadcast explaining the reason for the price hikes and announcing measures to lessen their impact.\n\nGhana provided transparent and readily monitored mitigation measures which included the immediate abolition of fees at government-run primary and junior secondary institutions, as well as a program to improve public transportation.\n\nIndonesia developed a clear strategy to educate the general population about the benefits of fossil-fuel subsidy reform.\n\nCampaigns against fuel subsidy removal have often lacked coherence and integrity. The argument for efficiency sounds hollow in the face of government waste, corruption, and inefficiency.\n\nRead also: Nigeria faces higher budget deficit on revived subsidy\n\nCash transfers\n\nSeveral governments that have tried to remove fuel subsidies in their respective countries have always aimed at protecting low-income households.\n\nThe Governance and Social Development Resource Centre (GSDRC), in its report titled \u201cexamples of successful fuel subsidy removal,\u201d indicated that the Indonesian government established a cash transfer scheme in October 2005 to compensate for an average 114 percent increase in product prices, though new levels remained below international market rates.\n\nHowever, this unconditional cash transfer proved to be an effective method for overcoming societal and political opposition to fuel-subsidy reform.\n\nPublic Trust\n\nThe importance of public trust in its government can never be overemphasized.\n\nA case study is Indonesia\u2019s administration, in January 2003, where corruption and inefficiencies of political life and bureaucracy, encountered considerable popular dissatisfaction from the public.\n\nIn furtherance, an attempt to raise fuel prices sparked popular outrage, prompting the administration to scale back much of the rise.\n\nHowever, the administration in power in 2005 roughly tripled the price of kerosene and nearly doubled the price of gasoline and diesel with no protest.\n\n\u201cPublic trust can also be improved if subsidy reform is timed with fiscal reform, establishing a more rational structure of energy taxes and improving education, health, and welfare,\u201d the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said.\n\nPhased approaches\n\nMany governments use this scheme to pursue a gradual approach to the removal of subsidies in order to minimise opposition from the interest groups that had benefited from the policies.\n\nUsing Brazil as a case study, the IMF stated that the transition to free-market prices in the country began with petroleum products used by a small number of people (e.g., asphalt, lubricants) and progressed to other extensively used items (e.g. gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and LPG).\n\n\u201cThe first items to lose subsidies were those that were commonly utilized by politically weak stakeholders, with the politically more problematic subsidies being eliminated later.\n\n\u201cWhile trade unions remained hostile to the price hikes, the general people accepted them, and there were no large-scale protests,\u201d said the IMF.\n\nInternational and Domestic Pressure\n\nOne of the solutions to the lack of political will is to apply pressure through international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, and Transparency International (TI).\n\n\u201cLoan institutions, assistance providers, and international organizations can also help developing nations design and implement subsidy reforms by transferring expertise and technology and enforcing well-reasoned lending and development aid conditions,\u201d UNEP said.\n\nCoherence in reform policy\n\nThis would ideally be designed with broad stakeholder support; set a timetable for implementation; include complementary policies to offset any negative effects on the poor and industry; develop a communications strategy to reassure stakeholders that their interests are being respected; create mechanisms to ensure transparency regarding subsidies and the reform process.\n\nAccording to the IMF, Iran began allowing a significant increase in natural gas and electricity costs in December 2010.\n\n\u201cThe country raised domestic energy prices by up to 20 times, becoming the first major oil-exporting country to significantly remove implicit energy subsidies.\u201d\n\nHowever, this entailed a complex and sequential process of defining objectives, legislation, lowering inflation, and establishing a cash transfer system.\n\nFurthermore, the forum indicated that all of these processes, well-sequenced, could arguably allow the reforms to achieve a degree of success.",

It is a big setback but we will not relent.\n\n\u201cWe are reiterating our appeal for recourse to the law and avoidance of generalizations. These killings and counter killings are unjustifiable.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor instance in 2020, 114 citizens were killed in Zangon Kataf and 28 in Kauru, and in 2021, 186 were killed in Zangon Kataf and 59 in Kauru and if you put the figures, we lost 387 people in these two councils. In 2021, 100 citizens incurred gun shot injuries in the two councils, 77 in Zangon Kataf and 23 in Kauru.\n\n\u201cThis is aside, houses and settlements burnt, farms destroyed, cattle killed and collapse of the rural economy affecting all the communities.\n\n\u201cWe must rise to the occasion and put a stop to all these challenges, arising from the behavior of a few elements on all sides. Let us reason together and avert this needless bloodshed.\u201d\n\nThe member of House of Representatives representing Zangon Kataf/Jaba federal constituency, Amos Gwamna Magaji, in his remarks supported the appeal for recourse to the law and collective campaign for peace in the locations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Agwatyap, Sir Dominic Gambo Yahaya, and Res-Tsam (Chief of Chawai), Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed, corroborated calls for peace and pledge their commitment to support security forces in their moves for sustainable peace and development.\n\nThe chairman of Zangon Kataf local government, Hon.

On a daily basis 426 children are at risk of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, issues of social development and poverty alleviation must be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, successive governments have rolled out numerous social development schemes- which appear perfect on paper. However, these schemes have fallen short of long-term impact.\n\n\u201cMany may fault successive governments for the failure of previous and current social development schemes. What analysts have failed to study is the implementation process. There must be a constituted authority or a political force at least to complement the government in implementing and deepening the impact of these schemes,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe group said Boko Haram insurgency and the COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively on the businesses and livelihood of the people of Borno and the country at large, saying Ndume has chosen to do things differently to cushion the effects.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAfter Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) as a stimulus package to support households and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and also trigger economic rebound, Ndume, initiated a group to come up with a training and sensitization formula to compliment the government\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cAcross the country, this loan has been misused as a large population of people see whatever comes from the government as free money that they have earned due to trials and difficulty they are facing; money that should not be put to good use, rather should be spent on short term goals and nothing can be done about it.\n\n\u201cNdume, in his efforts to make sure his constituency conforms with sustainable development tenets, especially as they have been bedeviled by poverty caused by insecurity, has ensured excellent representation for his people and ensured that almost 4000 individuals benefited from the CBN- NIRSAL Targeted Credit Facility for COVID-19 for his constituents to support their households and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) etc. Majority of whom are educated youth who form the large part of the population,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe group said Ndume\u2019s training has been able to sensitize and educate beneficiaries on the importance of the loan, suggest practical and productive businesses that they can engage in, guide existing SME Business owners on how to further build and promote their existing business, adding that most of the beneficiaries now know the importance of book keeping, registering business names and paying tax to link with the intention of the TCF funds\n\n\u201cNdume is getting feedback on challenges of beneficiaries and data base for monitoring and tracking the progress of beneficiaries. Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume represents the breed of leaders the third world needs to advance,\u201d the group said adding that the lawmaker has proven to be the bridge that connects the old and the new generations.\n\n\u201cHe has indeed showed his willingness to work with the youth and lead them to the bright future that is not far from now,\u201d the group said of Ndume.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oloniruha/Abuja\n\nNigeria Governors\u2019Forum (NGF) assailed the N3 trillion petrol subsidy claimed by the NNPC and dismissed it as fraught with fraud.\n\nChairman of the forum, Kayode Fayemi said this Wednesday night at a meeting with the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Abuja.\n\nHe said the governors doubt the N3 trillion petrol subsidy bandied by the NNPC and urged labour unions such as the oil industry PENGASSAN to join the forum to verify the figure.\n\nHe said that the governors through their internal mechanisms had already discovered that what was being paid was higher than what was actually being declared by the country\u2019s petroleum industry managers.\n\n\u201cWe need a partnership with the NLC to confront the challenges of what the NNPC is about, because there is a lot of fraud in the consumption and distribution figures that the country is getting\u201d, Fayemi said.\n\nWe need a partnership with the NLC to confront the challenges of what the NNPC is about, because there is a lot of fraud in the consumption and distribution figures that the country is getting\u201d, Fayemi said.\n\nFayemi said that subsidy removal has remained an on-going conversation not just among governors but the entire country, hence the governors must be part of the solution providers.\n\n\u201cThis is because there are raging questions of accountability associated with the issue subsidy removal in the country,\u201d he said\n\nHe said that both the NGF and the NLC could jointly work together to proffer solutions that would heal the economy and provide succour to the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cNigerian governors cannot ignore the economics of petroleum, this is because all the countries surrounding Nigeria including Niger, Mali, Cameroun and Ghana have their fuel pump price that is equivalent to a U. S dollar, while Nigeria has a pump price that is far less than a dollar.\n\n\u201cWe can only move forward if the NLC engages all those who are knowledgeable in the field like PENGASSAN to conduct a thorough research into the sector before any further action is taken on subsidy,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nHe stated that only about eight states were benefitting directly from the subsidy while all the others had to contend with the situation on their own.\n\nThe governor insisted that the partnership with the NLC must confront the perennial issue of palliatives for the common man towards cushioning the effects of subsidy removal on the citizenry.\n\n\u201cNot tackling the problem now is tantamount to postponing the evil day. Finding succour for the ordinary Nigerian at this time is absolutely imperative and necessary now more than ever,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nHe, however, pleaded with labour to jettison the decision to embark on nationwide protest and join hands with governors to consider the dimensions at play on the subsidy removal.\n\nFayemi said Nigeria\u2019s economy is at the precipice and failure of the Federal Government to be decisive on the petrol subsidy is like postponing the evil day,\n\nGov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo cautioned that Nigeria had a choice of continuing to behave like Santa Claus or take concrete actions, rather than throwing away N3 trillion on subsidy.\n\nObaseki suggested that the nation could in the interim, increase productivity to reduce imports and create jobs.\n\nHe also emphasised that the country would do well to revamp the power sector, without which Nigeria would continue to throw millions of its citizens into unemployment, and ultimately, poverty.\n\nGov. Simon Lalong of Plateau, who joined the meeting virtually, stated that the two groups must find options and create opportunities to address the hardships that stare the people on the face.\n\nLalong who said that the forum had been on the matter for three years, added that the painstaking work that led to the solutions that the NGF highlighted took a year to script together .\n\nHe said the two groups should immediately set out to work to find the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting with the NLC leadership led by its president Comrade Ayuba Waba, followed the NGF meeting of Jan.19 in Abuja.",

          "text": "\u2026as gov\u2019s strategic engagement train storms Ife, Modakeke\n\n\u2026we\u2019re ready for whatever mode of primary- Oyetola\n\nThe Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, and Ogunsua of Modakeke, Oba Moses Oladejo Oyediran, have lauded the Governor of the State, Adegboyega Oyetola, for keeping to his electoral promises despite the inheritant socioeconomic realities.\n\nThe reverred traditional rulers also threw their weights behind the Governor, saying they have no reason not to support his ambition for second term as he has made them, the people of the State and particularly their subjects proud through his people-oriented policies and programmes that have impacted positively on the lives of the masses.\n\nThis is even as Governor Adegboyega Oyetola declared that the ruling party in the State was ready for whatever the mode that might be adopted by the National Secretariat of the Party, Abuja, for the conduct of the governorship primaries come February 19th, this year.\n\nGovernor Oyetola had on Monday formally received his nomination form earlier purchased for him by his associates to contest for second term in the next governorship election in the State.\n\nSpeaking in his palace, on Wednesday, Ooni applauded Governor Adegboyega Oyetola for walking his talk and for his faithfulness to his electoral promises.\n\nOba Ogunwusi, who was represented by Obalufe of Ile-Ife, Oba Idowu Adediwura, said the Oduduwa kingdom was solidly behind the Governor.\n\nHe appreciated the good works the Governor has been doing to transform the State since assumption of office, just as he expressed confidence that the people of the State would reciprocate his gesture by returning him for a second term.\n\nThe foremost traditional ruler who appealed to the Governor not to be deterred or distracted called on him to continue his good works.\n\nHe identified some intra-city roads that needed urgent intervention, saying fixing those roads would help to complement the ongoing and already- completed infrastructure in the ancient town.\n\nAt the Ooni\u2019s palace, Governor Oyetola said, \u201cI am very happy to be here today. I am very sure that if Baba Kabiyesi were to be fully aware that we were coming, he would have managed to be here. But I am glad that we met all of you here. I have listened to all you said in terms of other things you want us to do.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t joke with Ife in the scheme of things. We are very committed to ensuring all-round development in Ile-Ife and its environs. What actually brought us here is to seek for your permission and blessings before we go to field to address our party loyalists.\n\n\u201cI am very happy that our party is united for APC in Ife. I am glad that Senator Omisore is with us. We commend you for your steadfastness, love and loyalty to our party. We can assure you of more developments.\n\n\u201cI commend our party loyalists for their commitment and dedication to the party. As you can see, your children are in key positions in government. I want your continued support and cooperation, I can assure you that we will not disappoint you.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Ogunsua of Modakeke, Oba Moses Oladejo Oyediran, assured the Governor of maximum support and cooperation, saying the entire Modakeke town would stop at nothing to re-elect him.\n\nThe monarch who showered royal blessings on the Governor and his entourage said his subjects are pleased with him and are committed to progressive cause because of his prompt and timely socioeconomic interventions aimed at changing the face of the town.\n\nCorroborating the monarch, the President, Modakeke Progressive Union, Julius Odegbemi, said the Union would do everything possible to support the Governor before, during and after the election.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure you that we are for you and having said that, it has become our resolution. We want to appreciate your Government for all you have been doing to uplift the socioeconomic and infrastructural status of our town. You have indeed shown your keen interest not only in our town but in our sons and daughters as manifested in the key positions they occupy.\n\n\u201cWe commend you for reconstructing Famia road. The gesture has helped to impact greatly the lives of our people as it has contributed significantly to their socioeconomic welfare and well-being. We want more infrastructural developments in Modakeke. As you can see, most of our roads are bad, we want your support to fix them\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile addressing the mammoth crowd of the party\u2019s supporters in Modakeke and Ile-Ife, Governor Oyetola disclosed that the large turnout of the people was an indication that Ife was for progressive government.\n\nHe expressed delight at the warm reception accorded him and his entourage by the people of the communities, saying their love for his government has once again been displayed.\n\nGovernor Oyetola who declared the party\u2019s readiness for any mode of primary that might be introduced by the National Secretariat of the party said, \u201cBe it direct, indirect or consensus, we are ready, our party is ready.\u201d\n\nHe called on the party\u2019s loyalists to remain united and formidable as the party\u2019s governorship primaries and election were fast approaching.\n\n\u201cWhat I have seen so far is a clear indication that Ife is for us. I have seen enthusiasms and show of love for our party and our government.

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Wednesday denied zoning its 2023 presidential ticket to any part of southern Nigeria as being speculated in viral reports making the rounds in the media space.\n\nIn the reports which went viral Tuesday, the anonymous author of the report stated that the APC had zoned its presidential ticket to the South-East, while that of the Vice President was zoned to the North, with other key positions spread round the different geo-political regions in the country.\n\nDismissing the report in a statement, Director General, Press and Media Affairs to Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee of the APC Mamman Mohammed, quoted Governor Mai Mala Buni as saying there was no iota of truth in the report.\n\nThe Yobe state governor added that a decision on zoning of the party\u2019s tickets would only be taken at the convention of the party coming up in February.\n\n\u201cThe attention of His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Yobe State and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni, has been drawn to media publications with purported zoning of offices allegedly announced by him,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nHe further said: \u201cHis Excellency has, in clear and unambiguous terms, denied the said list, saying, it is false, baseless, unfounded, misleading and has nothing to do with him.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee said the party has not taken any decision at any fora on anything relating to zoning of offices.\n\n\u201cThe publication is just a figment of the author\u2019s imagination that has nothing to do with the Chairman and the party. The public is hereby urged to disregard the purported list as it is misleading and completely false.\n\n\u201cGovernor Buni urged the press to resist unverified stories and rumours, and to always verify all issues related to the party assuring that the doors of the party are always open.\u201d\n\nOkorocha joins race\n\nIn a related development, the rank of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC swelled Wednesday with the declaration of Senator Rochas Okorocha (APC Imo West) for the contest.\n\nMaking the declaration Wednesday through a letter forwarded to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and read to other lawmakers, Okorocha said his joining the race was to offer Nigerians the leadership that would take Nigerians out of the wilderness .\n\nOkorocha, in the letter titled: \u201cNigerian President 2023 \u201c, said the country at the moment needed \u201d a detribalized Nigerian who can unite our country, a leader with a compassionate heart, who will care for the poor and downtrodden and the masses of our country, a visionary leader who can create wealth for our teaming populace thereby, addressing the issues of poverty, insecurity and youth restiveness.\u201d\n\nThe letter, in part, also informed the lawmakers of a proposed World Press Conference to be hosted by him Monday 31st January, 2022 at the Executive Hall of the International Conference Centre, Abuja at 11am.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, the Independent National Electoral Commission has announced the time table for the conduct of 2023 general election, including that of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith elections drawing nearer as the days go by, our citizens are concerned about the quality of persons to run the affairs of our nation, one who can address some of their major concerns.\n\n\u201cIt is as a result of these concerns that I wish to hold a world press conference on my intention to run for the office of the President of our dear Nation. I therefore wish to solicit for your prayers as I make known my intention\u201d, he said.\n\nAvailable records show that Okorocha is a 3-time presidential aspirant who made his first outing 20 years ago on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party(ANPP).\n\nHe sought the party\u2019s ticket alongside Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, Chief Nnia Nwodo and Chief Harry Akande.\n\nIn 2007, he ran on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) coming second to late President Umar Musa Yar\u2019adua in a contest that also had Prof Jerry Gana, Gen. Mohammed Gusau and Gen. Buba Marwa.\n\nSaraki too\n\nSimilarly, former Senate President Bukola Saraki has indicated interest to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\nHis declaration is coming after former National Leader of the All Progressives Congress Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Ebonyi Governor Dave Umahi, Senate Chip Whip Orji Kalu and former Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha declared a similar interest.\n\nThe two-term governor said he has a strong record of delivering and experience in making tough decisions.\n\nBorn December 19, 1962,? Saraki is the son of Second Republic Senator, late Olusola Saraki.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us.\n\n\u201cJoin me to make our communities safer and provide real opportunities for you and your families.

          "text": "Not less than 387 lives were lost to communal clashes in Kauru and Zangon Kataf local government areas of Kaduna state in 2020 and 2021, Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai stated this Wednesday at an emergency security meeting with traditional rulers, religious and community leaders from the areas.\n\nHe said the lives were lost to clashes among Atyap, Fulani, Chawai, Irigwe and Hausa ethnic communities in the two areas.\n\nThe meeting was held at the palace of the Agwatyap, A\u0320tak Njei, in Zangon Kataf.\n\nThe governor was represented by Commissioner for Home Affairs and Internal Security Samuel Aruwan and accompanied to the meeting by heads of security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe are here on behalf of the governor following the renewed killings in Kauru and Zangon Kataf local government areas. It is a big setback but we will not relent.\n\n\u201cWe are reiterating our appeal for recourse to the law and avoidance of generalisations. These killings and counter killings are unjustifiable,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving the figure, Aruwan said: \u201cFor instance in 2020, 114 citizens were killed in Zangon Kataf and 28 in Kauru, and in 2021, 186 were killed in Zangon Kataf and 59 in Kauru, and if you put the figures, we lost 387 people in these two councils. In 2021, 100 citizens \u2018incurred\u2019 gunshot injuries in the two councils, 77 in Zangon Kataf and 23 in Kauru.\n\n\u201cThis is aside houses and settlements burnt, farms destroyed, cattle killed and collapse of the rural economy affecting all the communities.\n\n\u201cWe must rise to the occasion and put a stop to all these challenges, arising from the behaviour of a few elements on all sides. Let us reason together and avert this needless bloodshed.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, member House of Representatives for Zangon Kataf/Jaba Federal Constituency, Amos Magaji, supported the appeal for a recourse to the law and campaign for peace in the areas.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Agwatyap, Dominic Yahaya, and Res-Tsam (Chief of Chawai), Yahaya Mohammed, pledged their support for the drive for sustainable peace and development in the areas.\n\nAlso speaking at the meeting, Chairman of Zangon Kataf local government area, Francis Sani, and his Kauru counterpart, Bashir Dawaki, also commended Governor El-Rufai \u201cfor dispatching a high-powered delegation to the areas following recent killings and counter killings.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Commander Sector 7 of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) Tony Opurum expressed concern over the incessant killings and lawlessness in the areas.\n\nOpurum, an army colonel, said the military would continue to work hard in containing threats to peace in the areas.\n\nSimilarly, Area Commander Kafanchan Police Area Command Danladi Ibrahim said: \u201cThe Police will continue to be neutral and prosecute anyone found guilty.\u201d\n\nThe meeting ended with all sides agreeing to deepen the campaign for peace and continue the engagements in all communities.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the participants appealed to the state government to resolve the land tussle lingering in Zangon Kataf since the 1992 crisis.\n\nThe Kaduna state government thanked the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD) for accepting to organise peace and security engagements in the two local government areas beginning from February 2022.\n\nACF fumes\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed worries over the incessant killings of innocent citizens in the North, noting that from civilisation, Nigeria was fast returning to barbarism.\n\nACF National Chairman Chief Audu Ogbeh made the remark Wednesday while addressing its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Kaduna.\n\nOn the recent killing of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar in Kano, the setting ablaze of 20 passengers in Sokoto and reported cases of bullying and sodomy in schools across the country, he said Nigeria cannot afford to return to barbarism after civilisation.\n\nHe said the APC would support a presidential candidate for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election, who has the capacity to move Nigeria out of the present security and economic challenges currently facing the nation.\n\nHe said the Forum would meet with their counterparts from other regions, like Afenifere, Ohanaeze, South South People Movement to discuss on peace building and consensus among the various regions.\n\n\u201cWe are having experiences which are very scary, a five-year-old girl killed by a school proprietor in Kano, 20 people were locked in a vehicle in Sokoto and set ablaze. It is a terrible thing. We appealed to proprietors of schools and government to take measures to stop these heinous crimes in our schools.\n\n\u201cHorrible things are happening even in government schools and military institutions. Many bad things are happening, bullying, sodomy all kinds of things are rumoured. Government must try very hard to bring order to these schools. We are very concerned about these developments, our country cannot return to barbarism after experiencing civilization.\n\n\u201cThere are economic challenges everywhere, people are finding it difficult to feed their family, kidnapping along highways, relentless criminalities. Farmers cannot go to their farms to harvest their crop, they have to pay taxes to be allowed to harvest their crops and farming is our main occupation in the North.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very delicate period; it is for these reasons that we are not having too many meetings because we don\u2019t want anybody coming for these meetings to be affected on the highways.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 election is on the way, people would meet you and ask if ACF is endorsing anyone or if ACF is supporting anyone, make it clear to them that we are not political parties, that the parties have not told us their candidates yet. After the candidates are picked by their parties, they will come to talk to us, they will give us their agenda, then we will know who to support.\n\n\u201cWe are not a political party but we hope we will get a good person who will lead Nigeria out of the circumstances in which we found ourselves. We have not had it this bad and it should not continue for too long.\n\n\u201cWe commend the Governor of Kaduna state for the wonderful job he is doing trying to change a semi rural town to a semi urban state. We also commend the Governor of Kano state for closing down that school and revoking the licenses of other private schools.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting with our counterparts from other regions, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, South South People Movement to discuss with them on building peace and consensus among the various regions. We have not held these meetings yet due to few obstacles. We need to appeal for peace and understanding to stop abusing and quarrelling with each other which does not make any sense and does not stand well for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cShould there be chaos here, where do we go as refugees? Refugees don\u2019t carry more than Ghana must go bag, you don\u2019t carry your car, your Television set, your microwave. We don\u2019t want chaos to take place,\u201d he said.",

But that of local government has to do with friction between the LEA secretaries and their chairmen when it has to do with the employment of teachers,\u201d he added.\n\nFCT NUT chairman, Comrade Stephen Knabayi, while speaking during the briefing, also explained that as far as NUT was concerned, the payment of teachers\u2019 salaries in LEA schools, FCT has been prompt and regular.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any issue with that as far as NUT is concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have been part of the meeting and members of JAAC where allocations come from the federation account and shared accordingly, where the issue of teachers salaries is made a frontline charge. Also, there is never a time when salaries are held by the six area councils.\n\n\u201cBut presently, we have directed that schools should be shut down in the six area councils with effect from today Wednesday. That has to do with the outstanding arrears and the none payment of the arrears of the new national minimum wage, and some months of annual increment in some LEAs,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Governors Forum and the Nigeria Labour Congress has queried the motives of subsidy administrations, particularly the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThis is according to a statement signed by NGF spokesperson Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo.\n\nAccording to the statement, the NGF and NLC agreed, after a meeting this week, that the \u201clacuna in the subsidy removal agenda was hidden in the untruths bandied by the administrators of the subsidy, particularly the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, which both groups identify to be at the forefront of the mismanagement of the proceeds accrued therein.\u201d\n\nNGF Chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi noted that action must be taken to ensure that Nigerians get direct benefits from subsidy and not just a few wealthy individuals and their cronies.\n\n\u201cWe need a partnership with the NLC to confront the challenges of what the NNPC is about, because there is a lot of fraud in the consumption and distribution figures that the country is getting and we can only move forward if the NLC engages all those who are knowledgeable in the field like PENGASSAN to conduct a thorough research into the sector before any further action is taken on subsidy,\u201d Fayemi said at the meeting.\n\nRead the NGF\u2019s full statement:\n\nAs a sequel to its meeting of the 19th of January the NGF, yesterday, met with the leadership of the NLC, led by its president Comrade Ayuba Waba, to deliberate on the fuel subsidy removal which both groups believe is a necessary action that the country must deal with now or in the nearest future.\n\nThe meeting which was held at the NGF secretariat in Maitama Abuja, brokered a partnership between the NGF and the NLC, as both parties agreed that the lacuna in the subsidy removal agenda was hidden in the untruths bandied by the administrators of the subsidy, particularly the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, which both groups identify to be at the forefront of the mismanagement of the proceeds accrued therein.\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the meeting also attended by the TUC president and a host of other leaders of organized Labour in the country, the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi argued that the nation\u2019s economy is at the precipice and that it has become necessary for the two groups to carefully verify all of NNPC\u2019s estimates to ensure that whatever action is taken on subsidy, it would be the people that get direct benefits and not a few wealthy individuals and their cronies in the country.\n\nDr Fayemi told the Labour leaderships that subsidy removal has remained an on-gong conversation not just among governors but the country at large and emphasized that Governors cannot but be part of the solution providers in this onerous task that is confronting the nation.\n\nThe Ekiti State Governor further stated that \u201cthere are raging questions of accountability associated with subsidy removal in the country and observed that the NGF and the NLC can jointly work together to proffer solutions that heal the economy and provide succour to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman who led a delegation of Governors Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State and chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, to the meeting stressed that governors cannot ignore the economics of petroleum, arguing that all the countries surrounding Nigeria including Niger, Mali, Cameroun and Ghana have their fuel pump price at the equivalent of a US dollar, arguing that Nigeria has a pump price that is far less than a dollar and is uncomfortable with the removal of subsidy until the challenge of what the NNPC is telling the country is confronted frontally.\n\n\u201cWe need a partnership with the NLC to confront the challenges of what the NNPC is about, because there is a lot of fraud in the consumption and distribution figures that the country is getting and we can only move forward if the NLC engages all those who are knowledgeable in the field like PENGASSAN to conduct a thorough research into the sector before any further action is taken on subsidy,\u201d Dr Fayemi declared.\n\nOn the part of the states, Dr Fayemi stated that only about eight states are benefitting directly from the subsidy while all the others have to contend with the situation on their own.\n\nThe Governor of Ekiti State also insisted that the partnership with the NLC must confront the perennial issue of palliatives for the common man towards cushioning the effects of subsidy removal on the citizenry stating that \u201cnot tackling the problem now is tantamount to postponing the evil day\u201d.\n\n\u201cFinding succour for the ordinary Nigerian at this time is absolutely imperative and necessary now more than ever,\u201d the NGF Chairman emphasised.\n\nOne of the asks, which formed the terms of convening the meeting was to also plead with Labour to jettison their decision to embark on what they referred to as a mega-strike and join hands with Governors to consider the dimensions at play on the subsidy removal palaver because Governors through their internal mechanisms had already found out that what is paid is egregiously higher than what is actually being declared by the country\u2019s petroleum industry managers.\n\nCommenting, the Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki, who usually serves the NGF as its shining light on economic issues, on his part warned that we have a choice of continuing to behave like Father Christmas (Santa Claus) or take concrete actions on a problem that is permanently with us rather than throwing away N3tr on subsidy.\n\nGovernor Obaseki suggested that the nation can, in the interim, increase productivity to reduce imports and create jobs. He also emphasised that the country would do well to revamp the power sector, which is virtually comatose because without power, we will continue to throw millions of our people into unemployment, and ultimately, poverty, reminding all present that we should know that we have a country to manage.\n\nThe Governor of Plateau state, Rt. Hon Simon Bako Lalong who like Governor Obaseki also joined the meeting virtually recalled that the NGF had spent three years on this matter because we cannot continue with subsidising petroleum products. He stated that we must find options and create opportunities that address the hardships that stare our people in the face.\n\nLalong volunteered that the painstaking work that led to the solutions that the NGF was highlighting took a year to script together and warned therefore that the fact that we are sitting here with Labour to resolve this contending issue does not mean that as we leave the table we should go to sleep. Instead, Governor Lalong said the teams from the two groups should immediately set out to work to find the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThis meeting took place barely an hour before the NLC announced the suspension of its mega-strike, as he disclosed to the governors that their committee had consulted widely and decided to call it off before arriving at the NGF secretariat.\n\nBoth Comrade Ayuba Waba and the TUC president stressed their lack of appreciation of the trust deficit that characterised previous negotiations and wondered why the subsidy issue had always been shrouded in lack of transparency on the part of government.\n\nThe unionists argued that the conflicting figures that always came from the managers of the petroleum sector had always tended towards inefficiency which have remained, to the people and to Labour, completely objectionable",

But since last year, he has faced a wave of discontent about armed groups\u2019 attacks that have killed some 2,000 people and forced a million and a half to flee their homes.\n\nOn Sunday, mutinies erupted in several army barracks a day after police dispersed banned protests, and on Monday, the army rebels brought the country under the control of the Patriotic Movement for Preservation and Restoration (MPSR), a military government led by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba.\n\nThe MPSR has announced the suspension of the constitution and dissolution of the government and parliament with Damiba saying on Monday that it would propose a return to constitutional order \u201cwithin a reasonable time frame\u201d.\n\nECOWAS said on Monday that Kabore was forced to resign under threat and intimidation.\n\nWest Africa has been rattled by three military coups in less than 19 months, beginning with Mali in 2020 and Guinea in September 2021.\n\nIn August 2020, army officers deposed Mali\u2019s elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who had likewise been facing protests for his handling of the country\u2019s violence.\n\nECOWAS has already slapped broad sanctions on Mali, where the military-led government said this month it planned to hold power through 2025, going back on a previous agreement to organise elections this February.\n\nGuinea underwent a coup in September last year, when officers toppled President Alpha Conde, 83, who had been president since 2010.\n\nHe sparked mass protests when he changed the constitution to allow himself to seek a third term at the ballot box.\n\nBoth Guinea and Mali have been suspended from ECOWAS, and the bloc has imposed an array of sanctions against those countries.",

          "text": "A chunk of a SpaceX rocket that blasted off seven years ago and was abandoned in space after completing its mission will crash into the Moon in March, experts say.\n\nThe rocket was deployed in 2015 to put into orbit a NASA satellite called the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR).\n\nSince then, the second stage of the rocket, or booster, has been floating in what mathematicians call a chaotic orbit, astronomer Bill Gray said on Wednesday.\n\nIt was Gray who calculated the space junk\u2019s new collision course with the Moon. The booster passed quite close to the Moon in January in a rendezvous that altered its orbit, said Gray.\n\nHe is behind Project Pluto, software that allows scientists to calculate the trajectory of asteroids and other objects in space and is used in NASA-financed space observation programs.\n\nA week after the rocket stage whizzed close to the Moon, Gray observed it again and concluded it would crash into the Moon\u2019s dark side on March 4 at more than 9,000km/h (5,500 mph).\n\nGray appealed to the amateur astronomer community to join him in observing the booster, and his conclusion was confirmed.\n\nThe exact time and location of impact may change slightly from his forecast but there is widespread agreement that there will be a collision on the Moon that day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking junk of this sort for about 15 years. And this is the first unintentional lunar impact that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Gray said.\n\nAstronomer Jonathan McDowell said, however, the effects of the collision will be minor, adding it is possible similar impacts have taken place unnoticed.\n\n\u201cThere are at least 50 objects that were left in deep Earth orbit in the 60s, 70s and 80s that were just abandoned there. We didn\u2019t track them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re picking up a couple of them \u2026 but a lot of them we\u2019re not finding and so they\u2019re not there any more,\u201d he added. \u201cProbably at least a few of them hit the moon accidentally and we just didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the chunk of SpaceX rocket, which weighs four tonnes, on the Moon will not be visible from Earth in realtime.\n\nBut it will leave a crater that scientists will be able to observe with spacecraft and satellites such as NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or India\u2019s Chandrayaan-2, and thus learn more about the geology of the Moon.\n\nSpacecraft have been intentionally crashed into the Moon before for scientific purposes, such as during the Apollo missions to test seismometers.\n\nIn 2009, NASA sent a rocket stage hurling into the Moon near its south pole to look for water.\n\nBut most rockets do not go so far from Earth. SpaceX brings its rocket boosters back through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so they disintegrate over the ocean. The first stage is recovered and reused.\n\nGray said there could be more unintentional crashes into the Moon in the future as the US and Chinese space programmes, in particular, leave more junk in orbit.\n\nThe US, together with international partners, is already planning a space station to orbit the Moon.\n\nMcDowell noted these events \u201cstart to be problematic when there\u2019s a lot more traffic\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually no one\u2019s job to keep track of the junk that we leave out in deep earth orbit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think now\u2019s the time to start regulating it.\u201d\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s company is currently developing a lunar lander that should allow NASA to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2025 at the earliest.",

          "text": "Prince Andrew has denied being a close friend of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, in a legal response to the woman who is suing him in the US for sexual assault.\n\nLawyers for the prince also say he wants to go before a jury to contest the claim brought by Virginia Giuffre.\n\nThe Duke of York has consistently denied all the allegations against him.\n\nMs Giuffre alleges he assaulted her when she was 17 at homes owned by Maxwell and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut in the 11-page court document, filed on Wednesday, Prince Andrew\u2019s legal team list a number of reasons why they believe her civil lawsuit should be dismissed.\n\nOne factor they ask the court to consider is the issue of consent.\n\nThe document says: \u201cAssuming, without admitting, that Giuffre has suffered any injury or damage alleged in the complaint, Giuffre\u2019s claims are barred by the doctrine of consent.\u201d\n\nThe document also states that Prince Andrew \u201cadmits that he met Epstein in or around 1999\u201d, but denies that he participated in any abuse with the late financier.\n\nOn the matter of a photograph of the prince with his arm around Ms Giuffre, with Maxwell in the background, his lawyers say they do not have enough information to admit or deny its existence.\n\nElsewhere, the document \u201cdenies\u201d Ms Guiffre\u2019s claim that Prince Andrew was a close friend of Maxwell.\n\nWriting to a US judge, his lawyers state: \u201cPrince Andrew hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted in the complaint.\u201d\n\nUS lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents a number of Maxwell\u2019s and Epstein\u2019s accusers, called this demand a \u201cPR move\u201d, saying Ms Giuffre had already asked for a jury trial.\n\nShe said Prince Andrew\u2019s request was \u201cmeaningless\u201d as it was Ms Giuffre\u2019s constitutional right to have a jury trial if she asked for one.\n\nPrince Andrew has shown he\u2019s ready to fight this out in court, firmly rejecting all the claims against him.\n\nEven that infamous photograph with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell is pushed back as unproven.\n\n\u201cPrince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegation that there exists photographic evidence of his alleged meeting with Giuffre,\u201d says his legal response.\n\nHis legal team are not giving any ground, with a robust denial of any wrongdoing and attacking the validity of the claims against him.\n\nPrince Andrew is now contesting this case as a private citizen and this latest move paves the way for a bombshell trial in the autumn.\n\nBut Buckingham Palace will not relish such thunder clouds hanging over the Platinum Jubilee year.\n\nAnd even though both sides will be flexing their legal muscles and talking tough, it doesn\u2019t rule out negotiations for a settlement.\n\nBut if that doesn\u2019t happen, Prince Andrew has shown he\u2019s ready to put his case to a New York jury.\n\nIn the papers, Prince Andrew\u2019s lawyers further argue that Ms Giuffre has no legal basis to bring the case since she is a permanent resident of Australia.\n\nThey also refer to a 2009 settlement agreement between Ms Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, a longtime associate of Prince Andrew.\n\nEpstein, a convicted sex offender, killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. British socialite Maxwell was found guilty last month of grooming underage girls to be abused by him.\n\nMs Giuffre is suing the Queen\u2019s son for allegedly sexually assaulting her in London, New York and the Virgin Islands when she was a teenager.\n\nShe is seeking unspecified damages, but there is speculation the sum could be in the millions of dollars.\n\nEarlier in the month, a judge ruled that the case could proceed.\n\nBuckingham Palace later stripped Prince Andrew of his military titles and patronages, and said he would contest the case as a private individual.\n\nThe new court documents describe the Queen\u2019s second son as \u201cPrince Andrew, Duke of York aka Andrew Albert Christian Edward, in his personal capacity\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, David Boies \u2013 who is representing Ms Giuffre \u2013 said his client and legal team \u201clook forward to confronting Prince Andrew with his denials and attempts to blame Ms Giuffre for her own abuse at his deposition and at trial\u201d.",

          "text": "Nuclear-armed North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles on Thursday, drawing condemnation from the United States for what would be the sixth round of missile tests this month.\n\nThe series of tests is among the most missiles ever launched by North Korea in a month, analysts said, as it begins 2022 with a dizzying display of new and operational weapons.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it had detected the launch of what it presumed were two ballistic missiles at about 8 a.m. (2300 GMT) from near Hamhung, on the east coast of North Korea. They travelled for about 190 km to an altitude of 20 km, JCS added.\n\nNorth Korea said this month it would bolster its defences against the United States and consider resuming \u201call temporally-suspended activities\u201d, an apparent reference to a self-imposed moratorium on tests of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles\n\nThe launch came after North Korea fired two cruise missiles into the sea off its east coast on Tuesday, adding to the tension over its tests.\n\nEarlier in the month, North Korea tested tactical guided missiles, two \u201chypersonic missiles\u201d capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and a railway-borne missile system.\n\n\u201cThe (Kim Jong Un) regime is developing an impressive diversity of offensive weapons despite limited resources and serious economic challenges,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, an international affairs professor at Ewha University in Seoul.\n\nCertain tests aim to develop new capabilities, especially for evading missile defences, while other launches are intended to demonstrate the readiness and versatility of missile forces that North Korea has already deployed, he said.\n\n\u201cSome observers have suggested that the Kim regime\u2019s frequent launches are a cry for attention, but Pyongyang is running hard in what it perceives as an arms race with Seoul,\u201d Easley said.\n\nIn a speech to the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament on Tuesday, North Korea\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Han Tae Song, accused the United States of staging hundreds of \u201cjoint war drills\u201d while shipping high-tech offensive military equipment into South Korea and nuclear strategic weapons into the region.\n\n\u201c(This) is seriously threatening the security of our state,\u201d Han said.\n\n\u2018REMARKABLE\u2019\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson condemned the launches as a violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and a threat to North Korea\u2019s neighbours and the international community.\n\nThe United States remains committed to a diplomatic approach and calls on North Korea to engage in dialogue, the spokesperson said.\n\nAs with other recent tests, the U.S. military\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command said that the launch was destabilising but did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. territory or personnel, or to its allies.\n\nSouth Korean and U.S. nuclear envoys had a phone call during which they shared \u201cdeep concerns\u201d over the latest test and agreed to continue cooperation to prevent further escalation, Seoul\u2019s foreign ministry said.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s recent \u201cremarkable development\u201d in nuclear and missile technology could not be overlooked, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a briefing.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s National Security Council convened an emergency meeting, at which it said the launches were \u201cvery regrettable\u201d and went against calls for peace and stability in the region, the presidential Blue House said in a statement.\n\nAt a media briefing in Bejing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China urged all parties to \u201cspeak and act with caution, stick to the right direction of dialogue and consultation, and jointly promote the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration sanctioned several North Korean and Russian individuals and entities this month on accusations they were helping North Korea\u2019s weapons programmes, but China and Russia delayed a U.S. bid to impose U.N. sanctions on five North Koreans.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Japan and Korea Mark Lambert said that Washington had \u201cno reservations\u201d about talking with North Korea and was willing to meet anywhere and talk about anything.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a serious discussion about the denuclearisation of North Korea, and if North Korea is willing to do that, all sorts of promising things can happen,\u201d he said during an online seminar hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nNorth Korea has defended its missile tests as a sovereign right of self-defence and said U.S. sanctions proved that even as the United States proposes talks, it maintained a \u201chostile\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cThe recent test-firing of new types of weapons was part of activities for carrying out a medium- and long-term plan for development of national science,\u201d the North Korean U.N. envoy Han said in a speech on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt does not pose any threat or damage to the security of neighbouring countries and the region.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea has not launched long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) or tested nuclear weapons since 2017 but began testing a slew of shorter-range missiles after denuclearisation talks stalled following a failed summit with the United States in 2019.",
