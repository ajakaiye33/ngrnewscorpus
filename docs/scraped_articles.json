He noted that choosing to be positive about life is the best way to grow and be their best version.\n\nThe philanthropist and entertainer said this while giving his Independence Day message when quizzed by a Pastor at SPAC Nation, Tobi Adegboyega, during his visit to the clergyman in London.\n\nAccording to Obi Cubana, \u201cthere is hope, things will not be like this forever, and then we also will not hold the government 100 per cent accountable for what is going on. I have decided personally that I want to do everything possible to promote positivity around me. So when you start showing that positive side, people learn from you; there are a lot of things that when you do right, before you know it, it becomes organic around you and then people look up to you and then they know there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn most times, we see it as a hopeless situation and people do what they like, even the advanced countries have their own moments and so they take a decision to say enough is enough. The citizens and youths should also be prepared to know that it starts from us, the orientation and everything should begin with us, so as we grow, those who are behind us have something to look at and emulate. We should change the narrative before us and not do things just like those in front of us.\u201d\n\nObi Cubana stressed, \u201cI am a living testimony, there is hope for the young, even if you don\u2019t know what you want to do, as long as you are willing to be directed, a good listener, fast learner, there is hope. Nigeria has over 200 million young populations which are growing. As someone in the entertainment industry, I see a lot of endless opportunities; in hotels, restaurants, music, arts, culture and all of these lies in the hands of young people. We rule in every aspect of these, so there is hope.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the success of the Cubana brand, he noted that from inception, their belief has been hinged on integrity, hard work and focus. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for a business I will do for a few years, pick the money and go, we are trying to create brands that will outlive us that our children will take over from them, so once they die, the business dies and their children are not even interested. Right now, we are building the Cubana brand to involve every member of the team, not just our children; Cubana can run without me that is why I can be here.\u201d\n\nWhen Pastor Adegboyega quizzed about the expansion of his brand, he informed that by the end of next year, the Cubana group would have set up at least in two locations in the United Kingdom, while adding that in the next decade, it will be a takeover for the brand.",

          "text": "The Federal Government said yesterday that about 30 per cent of the nation\u2019s foreign exchange earnings is spent on petroleum products importation.\n\nBut the government believes that the trend could be halted if the nation\u2019s refineries were functioning and projects like Dangote Refinery come on board.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha spoke yesterday at the Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat in Abuja.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMustapha said the nation\u2019s refineries will become functional \u201cfrom 18 months through to 48 months,\u201d while the Dangote Refinery will be inaugurated next year.\n\nHe said that the nation\u2019s foreign exchange market could be boosted through proper management of the Education and Health sectors.

INEC also said the version passed by the Senate would compromise its independence.\n\nThe INEC insisted it had the capacity to transmit election results across the country.\n\nAt plenary yesterday, the Senate examined the recommendations of the Conference Committee of both chambers which dumped the version of the amendment Act earlier passed by the Senate.\n\nThe Senate in plenary through voice vote okayed e-transmission of results by the electoral commission.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Senate went further to endorse the proposal that INEC should be free to use electronic voting.\n\nThe Senate also approved an amendment, which provides that political parties would henceforth, use only the direct mode of primary to nominate candidates for elections.\n\nThe resolutions of the Senate followed a motion titled: \u201cMotion for recommittal\u201d sponsored by Senate Leader Senator Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nShedding light on the decision, Senator Basiru said the conference committee looked at four sections of the proposed bill-43, 52, 63 and 87.\n\nOn Section 43, he said the committee allowed INEC to deploy electronic machines while the party agents are also at liberty to inspect the machines.\n\nThe senator said Section 52, which has to do with the transmission of results, raised two concerns.\n\nThe first concern, in his view, is the possibility of disenfranchising the electorate in areas where there are no networks.\n\nThe second is the possibility of hacking the system.\n\nHowever, the Senate spokesman pointed out that when the Act was reviewed, it was discovered that Section 63 of the bill passed in the two chambers had provided a clue.\n\nQuoting a part of the section, Basiru said the implication is that election must be concluded and the result entered on the form at the polling booth.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe result must be counted and recorded on the form. Therefore, it is not automatic transmission. Results can only be transmitted after the conclusion of election. The result must be on the form before the transmission.\n\nBasiru added that while the recourse to the NCC has been discarded, INEC can resort to the technological method of choice.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe use the word transfer, not transmit, after the recording of results at polling units.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBasiru also shed light on the provisions on direct primaries, stressing that INEC now had a constitutional duty to vigorously monitor the primaries.\n\nHe said political parties are now mandated by the law to furnish the aspirants and the electoral commission with the guidelines and the party membership register.\n\nThe spokesman said the issue of armophorous membership will become a thing of the past.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cAccreditation will be based on party register. Any aggrieved person can go to the Federal High Court to challenge any aspect.\u201d\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike commended the National Assembly, saying the resolution of the National Assembly Joint Committee is a good development.\n\nWike, who spoke in Port Harcourt, said Nigeria should have gone beyond manual voting.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think it is a good development for Nigeria and democracy. And I will urge them, the two Chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate, to abide by that recommendation by the Joint Committee of the two Chambers, because it is in their own interest.\n\n\u201cI commend the Senate President and the Speaker, House of Representatives, all the principal officers and members who felt that they must listen to what is good for Nigeria and what is good for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wike said direct or indirect primaries should be the exclusive decision of political parties.\n\nHe maintained that it will be unfair for the National Assembly to prescribe for political parties how to conduct their primaries.\n\nSpokesman of INEC chairman Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi said the electoral agency will await President Muhammadu Buhari assent before reacting to the Senate action.\n\nNational Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance APGA Victor Oye said electronic transmission of election results is best for democracy.\n\nHe told The Nation yesterday in Awka that the method would eliminate delays, ensure credibility and make it less cumbersome\n\nOye, said: \u201cIn a modern society, it is the right thing to do. It will enhance our democratic process\n\n\u201cEverything should be electronic; it makes it credible. It is a simple thing. Again, we have to ensure the system does not malfunction unnecessarily and prone to abuse\n\n\u201cThe benefits are many, it will eliminate delays. It will ensure credibility in transmitting results. The other style was cumbersome and prone to malfunctioning\u201d.\n\nFormer Deputy State President Ike Ekweremadu commended the Senate for reversing itself describing it as a huge victory for democracy.\n\nEkweremadu said the Senate\u2019s action justified his assurances to Nigerians in July that hope was not lost for electronic transmission of 2023 election results, despite the initial setback.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, Ekweremadu said: \u201cI want to specially commend the Senate for setting aside narrow partisan interests to correct the mistake of July 15, 2021 by reversing itself on the issue of electronic transmission of election results.\u201d",

          "title": "Unending debate over election and technology",
          "text": "The use of technology in the conduct of elections has generated debate in recent times. With the Conference Committee of the National Assembly set to harmonise their positions on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the question is whether Nigeria is ripe for electronic voting. The Kaduna State Government has successfully conducted two local government polls, using electronic voting, after amending its electoral laws to provide a legal framework for its use. The electoral umpire also says it is fully prepared. But, it is now up to the members of the National Assembly, reports TONY AKOWE\n\nThe successful conduct of the recent local government election in Kaduna State has no doubt put to rest the belief that electronic voting is not feasible in the country. Indeed, Kaduna State pioneered the use of electronic voting in 2018 when the Governor Nasir el-Rufai administration deployed technology in that year\u2019s council election. It deployed the same technology during the just-concluded elections in the state. The success of the experimentation with electronic voting in Kaduna State has now put the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) under pressure to opt for it during the next general elections.\n\nThe only thing that would stop the commission from going ahead with it during the next general electronic is the legal framework that is required to make such exercise legitimate. A close study of the Electoral Act recently passed into law indicates that there may still be several hurdles to cross before achieving electronic voting in the country.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile the provisions of the act as proposed by the Senate states that INEC requires the approval of the National Assembly and the National Communication Commission (NCC) to determine where to adopt electronic voting, the version passed by the House of Representatives gives the electoral umpire the power to decide where to do so. The Senate\u2019s position states that \u201cthe commission may consider electronic transmission provided the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and approved by the National Assembly\u201d.\n\nThe House of Reps version also states that \u201call ballots at an election under this bill at any polling station shall be deposited in the ballot box in the open view of the public\u201d. Critics say this provision of the bill is designed to act as a clog in the wheel of achieving electronic voting; if \u201call ballots\u201d must be deposited in a ballot box.\n\nThe two chambers have set up a committee to harmonise both versions. The implication is that if the committee settles for the Senate\u2019s version, then the issue of electronic voting and electronic transmission of results may have been foreclosed. But, if they settle for the House of Reps version, then there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel for the use of technology in the nation\u2019s electoral system, as it will give INEC the power to determine where and when to deploy technology and where and when to resort to manual systems.\n\nINEC has been insisting that it is ready to conduct both the voting and the transmission of results electronically. The commission says it is conscious of the legal bottleneck it has to surmount first before it can achieve electronic voting and transmission. The Nation was not able to get a response from the INEC National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye. But he was quoted as saying that the commission is ready for electronic voting. Okoye added, however, that the legal instrument backing up the deployment of e-voting machines in the electoral process must first be dealt with.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nExecutive Director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), Auwal Musa Rafsanjani supports the idea of using electronic voting for the 2023 elections. Justifying his position, he said: \u201cWe strongly think that electronic voting should be used for the upcoming 2023 elections. This is because as you know, INEC just last week in its Position Paper \u201cNo.1/2021 Electronic Transmission of Election\u201d stated that it was ready for electronic transmission of results. Indeed, I believe we are matured for electronic voting and whether we like it or not, we are in an age of technology, and we have embraced this in different sectors of our lives.\n\n\u201cIf you go to most remote villages in Nigeria, you will find different individuals using Point of Sale (PoS) machines to conduct transactions and withdraw cash. These machines now compete with automated teller machines (ATMs) of banks. If you look around, we have the Tax Identification Number (TIN), we have National Identity Number (NIN), we also have Remita and the likes. Now, why don\u2019t we embrace this in our electoral process? We find politicians embracing technology and social media for campaigns, but why don\u2019t they want the same technology for elections? We can also look at the commendable use of electronic voting in Kaduna as well.\u201d\n\nRafsanjani believes that the advantages of using electronic voting outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nIn his words: \u201cWhen it comes to electronic voting, the pros far outweigh the cons if any. The good thing is that technologies like blockchain have been proven to be very efficient. We have also seen other countries adopt electronic voting, so why are we scared? If we adopt electronic voting and especially the electronic transmission of results, we will significantly minimize if not completely remove errors and issues during the collation of results. This will also eradicate unnecessary delays in the declaration of results due to manual computation and improve the efficiency of the process. It will also prevent fraudulent manipulation of results by powerful and influential actors in our political space. Nigeria as a nation will also be in tune with current developments which are geared towards a greater deployment of technology in conducting business and governance in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cOne other fundamental issue that will be resolved is the bloodshed experienced during elections where we have citizens and security officials being attacked and killed during the collation process. If it is electronically transmitted, there won\u2019t be a need to have security personnel escort results from polling unit to ward levels and the local levels before state and national. And this will also ensure greater transparency of our electoral process.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Executive Director, Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA), Ezenwa Nwagwu also supports the use of electronic voting for the 2023 elections. He said: \u201cElectronic voting is unarguably desirable against the background of the fact that we ought to be working to reduce as much as possible, the human element in our electoral process\u201d.\n\nNwangwu, however, warned of the need to approach the use of technology in the electoral process with caution. It is important to remind us also that we must approach technology with modest caution especially when we consider the undeniable concerns of internet connectivity around the country. He is also of the view that all legislative obstacles to the deployment of technology must first be removed so that its applicability will solely be determined by electoral managers when suitable and needed.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, former Secretary-General of the pan northern socio-political group m Arewa Consultative Forum, Anthony Sani also cautioned against the use of technology in the election given the epileptic nature of telecom in the country and because of the act that network services have often failed at critical times. He said: \u201cEvery Nigerian would want INEC to explore the use of electronic voting and electronic transmission of results to improve the electoral processes for free and fair elections for the express purpose of conferring credibility on the elections and, thus, more legitimacy on the governments.\n\nRead Also: APC clears Plateau local council elections\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the internet coverage needed for the use of electronic voting and e-transmission at this point is said by NCC to be only 43 per cent and only covers 50 per cent of polling units nationwide. We experience the effects of such weak coverage daily where some areas are not covered by the services of providers. We hear of NO NETWORK SERVICES in many areas. We also experience a lack of network in banks where services are halted due to lack of network. Even in the use of Card Readers, there have been instances where Card Readers failed to deliver on their services due to poor network coverage. Recall what happened in Rivers state.\n\n\u201cIt is against such a backdrop that some people fear the use of electronic voting and e-transmission of results at this point when internet coverage is only 43 per cent and can cover only 50 per cent of the polling units nationwide may de-franchise many Nigerians in those units not covered by internet networks. Also, at this level of our development, we should be wary of the possibility of hacking. If the developed countries still grapple with challenges posed by hackers, it would be worse in our clime that is not fully developed technologically.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing his colleagues shortly after passing the Electoral Act amendment bill in July before the House embarked on its summer vacation, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila said even though the House was leaving the issue of electronic voting and transmission of results to the discretion of INEC, it is not feasible to have electronic voting in Nigeria now. He said: \u201cFor clarity, we have left the controversial Section 52 as recommended by the committee which is to allow INEC to determine what to do. At least, we have been better informed by NCC that came and answered very critical questions.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to talk to people out there as well. We all want electronic transmission of results, but based on the information from experts, it is not as easy as it sounds. We must get our electoral process right and when the right is right, we can come back and amend the law. We don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anybody. We have consistently said that every vote must count. It is not about 10 or 20 per cent coverage or even 90 per cent. If one person\u2019s vote is not counted, it will defeat what we have said on this floor that every vote must count.\n\n\u201cWe also heard an objective view on the issue of transmission. It is not like using POS. he told us that NCC had about 49 per cent coverage as of 2018. Since 2018, INEC has created more polling units. So, the percentage might have been lower or higher than that. They have also told us that there is a possibility of hacking and we would not want to leave our election to chance\u201d.\n\nThe speaker said there is a big difference between electronic voting and electronic transmission of results. He added: \u201cFrom my research, electronic voting does not even take place in any European country that I know of. Not in Germany, not in England, not in Spain, not in France or any part. In fact, in Germany, they did a referendum on electronic voting and they voted against it. So, I don\u2019t think that electronic voting is feasible right now. What we have been talking about is electronic transmission and from what we have been told today, we need to do more work so that everybody\u2019s vote will count.\u201d\n\nBut, former President Goodluck Jonathan believes the idea is worth implementing. He said the gains recorded so far in the area should not be jettisoned. The former president who spoke at a lecture in Abuja said: \u201cIf we as a nation truly desire to secure the credibility and integrity of our election; if we truly desire to deepen the roots of democracy in our land, we should not seek to reverse the progress already recorded by INEC in the application of modern tools in the conduct of elections but aim to improve the processes in the light of new technology.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult, therefore, to understand why the argument against the possibility of electronic transmission of election results continues to subsist, despite all the advancements made in information and communication technology over the years. There is no doubt that the independence of the electoral management body is the key plank upon which a thriving democracy rests. In Nigeria, the agency with the constitutional responsibility for this role is the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for those involved in the ongoing electoral reforms to review their efforts and ask themselves some tough questions. That way, they will be able to determine whether they are advancing the course of democracy by working to enhance and protect the constitutionally guaranteed duties of INEC or seeking to encumber the body with unnecessary posturing, capable of negatively affecting the exercise of its independence, in the conduct of elections.\u201d\n\nHowever, spokesman to INEC chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi warned of the need to separate electronic voting as an option in the democratic space and electronic voting as a business venture of those waiting to become contractors and suppliers. He said: \u201cTo begin with, we need to carefully distinguish between those who genuinely desire an improvement in the electoral system and those whose primary interest is simply the business opportunity they are waiting to grab if electronic voting is finally legalised. Nigerians should be wary of any comment emanating from such capitalists. The subsisting law is the 1999 Constitution, from which the 2010 Electoral Act (as amended) derives its legitimacy.\n\n\u201cIn this subsisting body of laws, voting in an election through electronic means is still illegal. It will remain so until a new law is passed. There is an amendment process going on in respect of the Electoral Act. We don\u2019t yet know what the final product will look like. We all desire a change and the commission has been working with the two committees of the National Assembly to bring about this change that we all desire. But, it is only when the amendment process is concluded, and the president gives assent, that we can say, categorically, whether or not electronic voting will be adopted for the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting that the commission was willing and ready for electronic voting and collation of results, he added: \u201cOnce the law clears the way, INEC will hit the ground running. It is not true that the commission has concluded plans not to use electronic voting. It is a mere rumour that should be disregarded.\u201d However, he said if there is no new law that expressly legalises the use of electronic voting and collation of results, then the commission will have no option other than to conduct the 2023 general election manually.",

          "title": "National Assembly: electronic voting to the rescue",
          "text": "With the assurances provided by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Nigerians are clamouring for the introduction of electronic transmission of election results and by extension, electronic voting in the next general elections. But, the only thing that may thwart the deployment of technology is the absence of an enabling law. Members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, are not too optimistic that deploying technology that is yet to be tested on a large scale would be in the interest of the country. Yesterday, the parliament finally approved e-voting. Correspondent SANNI ONOGU reports\n\nTo many observers, politicians, civil society activists and members of academia, Nigeria\u2019s readiness to adopt electronic voting for the conduct of the 2023 general elections is not in doubt. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has also avowed its readiness to introduce e-voting in 2023 and future elections subject to enabling legislation being emplaced.\n\nHowever, efforts to amend the Electoral Act 2010 to provide for e-voting have failed to yield desired results since 2015. However, yesterday, the parliament gave it nod. While the amendment done by the Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki-led Eight National Assembly suffered stillbirth due to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal of assent, analysts fear that the ongoing efforts to realign the Electoral Act by making categorical provision for e-voting may suffer a similar fate going by the aversion to electronic transmission of results already displayed by the Ninth Senate.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nClamour for e-voting:\n\nWith the assurance by INEC that it has worked out the modalities for further deployment of technology in future elections, provided the enabling law is put in place by the National Assembly, Nigerians are clamouring for the introduction of electronic transmission of election results and by extension e-voting. But, the lawmakers, particularly those in the upper legislative chamber, believe that deploying a technology that is yet to be tested on a large scale during the next general elections may not be in the interest of the country.\n\nTo some of them, electronic voting, as distinct from the electronic transmission of results, is an utopia or a dreamland \u2013 desirable but never attainable, especially in a country like Nigeria. Notwithstanding, the agitation for the adoption of e-voting in Nigeria has continued to soar. This stems largely from the nation\u2019s unenviable record of an electoral heist.\n\nThe fraud, violence and prolonged post-election litigations that often characterise electoral contests in the country are often cited as ills that would easily fade away if e-voting becomes the modus operandi for the conduct of elections in the country. Added to this is the inherent ability of the technology to save time, reduce cost, intentional manipulation, rigging, eliminate human error, ballot box snatching, hijack of election materials, unbridled violence during elections and engender trust and credibility in the electoral process.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, e-voting is not without its downsides. Electronic systems can be compromised by hackers, thereby making nonsense of the technology and reversing intended gains.\n\nIs Nigeria ripe for it?\n\nINEC says yes. Its chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu said the agency\u2019s only hindrance to the deployment of electronic voting is the lack of an enabling law. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye said a team of in-house engineers were currently evaluating proposals submitted by 49 companies, both local and foreign, for the supply of e-voting machines. Prof Yakubu had also in his remarks at the 2021 budget defence before the House of Representatives Committee on Electoral Matters last year indicated that the commission would deploy electronic voting machines \u201cvery soon,\u201d possibly beginning with the Anambra governorship poll scheduled to hold next month.\n\nHowever, the commission has been seeking an amendment of the legal framework that would enable electronic voting. This, it remains committed to introducing electronic voting machines in the electoral process to replace the manual system that had put the commission under heavy logistics burden, including the printing of electoral papers and hiring of thousands of ad hoc staff, among others.\n\nOpinions divided:\n\nAlthough opinions on whether Nigeria is ripe for electronic voting or not remain divergent, Yakubu had said at the inauguration of the 1999 Constitution Review Committee of the House of Representatives in October 2020 that elections in the country were \u201ctoo manual, expensive, cumbersome and archaic\u2026 the encumbrance of the deployment of full technology in elections should be removed\u201d.\n\nAs debate soars over the workability of e-voting and transmission of results rages, former President Goodluck Jonathan has joined the ranks of those insisting that electronic voting is the way to go.\n\nHe canvassed for the immediate adoption of the system to curb the ugly trend of politicians using thuggery and cultism to win elections in the country. Jonathan who spoke during the Third Synod of the Diocese of Ogbia at St Mark\u2019s Anglican Church, Otakeme, Bayelsa State, recently said over 50 per cent of the problems faced by the country, including insurgency, cultism and corruption, would be addressed with the adoption and effective use of e-voting.\n\nHe blamed the rising insecurity in the country on activities of politicians who were hell-bent on grabbing political power through the backdoor, against the popular wish of the people.\n\nThe former president said: \u201cOur political activities, particularly the use of young people as militiamen and thugs and so on, to win elections has increased the security challenges facing our nation.\n\n\u201cSome of the youths they use are so protected that even the police cannot arrest them because they are \u2018boys\u2019 to powerful politicians who use them during elections.\n\n\u201cThat is why I have always advocated that for us to move forward as a country, we must use electronic voting where nobody will use thugs to win elections. Immediately we use electronic voting, the issue of thuggery and cultism will drop by at least 50 per cent.\u201d\n\nAge of technology:\n\nThe Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Auwal Musa Rafsanjani told The Nation that electronic voting should be adopted for the 2023 general elections. Rafsanjani who is also the chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), a civil society organisation committed to free and fair elections strongly believes electronic voting should be used for the upcoming 2023 elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are in the age of technology and almost everyone is embracing it for business transactions. Politicians are embracing technology and social media for their campaigns, so why don\u2019t they want the same technology for elections? This same technology has been used commendably for local government elections in Kaduna State. It is no magic wand, but the pros far outweigh the cons. We have also seen other countries adopt electronic voting, so why are we scared? If we adopt electronic voting, and especially the electronic transmission of results, we will significantly minimise, if not completely remove, errors and issues during the collation of results.\n\nBenefits surpass challenges:\n\n\u201cThis will also eradicate unnecessary delays in the declaration of results due to manual computation and improve the efficiency of the process. It will also prevent fraudulent manipulation of results by powerful and influential actors in our political space. Nigeria as a nation will also be in tune with current developments which are geared towards a greater deployment of technology in conducting business and governance in the 21st Century.\n\n\u201cOne other fundamental issue that will be resolved is the bloodshed experienced during elections where we have citizens and security officials being attacked and killed during the coalition process. If it (election result) is electronically transmitted, there won\u2019t be a need to have security personnel escort results from polling unit to ward levels and the local levels before state and national, and this will also ensure greater transparency of our electoral process.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Ogande of the Department of Mass Communication, Nasarawa State University, also believes that the time for electronic voting in Nigeria is now. He argued that since the world is becoming increasingly digitalised, Nigeria has no other option than to adopt e-voting in 2023. He said: \u201cYes there has been an argument that: \u2018The most advanced democracies such as the United States, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe have difficulty in shielding their electoral systems from cyber-attacks and Nigeria being substantially deficient in ICT, has no capacity and or capability to manage frauds associated with electronic voting.\u2019\n\n\u201cPlausible as this argument, yet these same advanced democracies have not resorted back to manual conduct of elections. It simply means that the benefits far outweigh the losses, so it is worth a try.\n\n\u201cHowever, some of the challenges to encounter in e-voting in Nigeria are inadequate internet coverage, especially in rural communities, epileptic electricity supply, activities of internet hackers, insecurity of e-voting gadgets at polling units, inadequate sensitization and adoption by the electorate and the lack of political will power by the government.\n\nFor example, if the government is sincere, President Buhari should have passed the Electoral Act Amendment bill long ago.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nChallenges:\n\n\u201cThese and other challenges threaten the effective deployment of e-voting in the upcoming 2023 general election in Nigeria. The globe has gone digitized; Nigeria has no choice bu,t to begin with e-voting in 2023 general elections as her litmus test to catch up with the rest of the world, however, meekly.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary General, Campaign for Democracy (CD), Pastor Ifeanyi Odili said the use of e-voting for the 2023 general election is feasibl, if politicians will allow it. Odili said: \u201cElectronic voting is a welcome development. It is good for so many reasons, and because of its many advantages, those politicians who cannot make it in a free and fair election contest would not allow it.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, what are the benefits of electronic voting? This voting technology has the intention to speed up ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. Also in the long term, expenses are expected to decrease. Results can be reported and published faster.\n\n\u201cNow, if you behold all these benefits, our political leaders, business class and the so called bureaucrats, I mean the civil servants who are deeply enmeshed in corruption and electoral fraud, who want to fraudulently benefit more from manual voting would not allow the INEC to succeed in this proposal. Taking a look at the expenses that are expected to decrease, the corrupt elements would cry foul, they would do everything human possible to thwart the proposal.\n\n\u201cI also mentioned that election results can be reported and published faster with electronic voting. I ask therefore, which of these politicians who obviously cannot win elections in their communities in a clean and clear contest would want election results to be reported or published earlier than their expectations? The answer is none! What I am only saying is that it is a welcome development. It is feasible. I mean INEC has come out with good election proposals, but the evil ones at the corridors of power, I mean the politicians in collaboration with their allies at the National Assembly and the civil service would not allow this good proposal to see the light of the day.\n\n\u201cTimes without numbers, I have said that, our problem as a nation is not the institution. It is a problem of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. It is a problem of corruption which has eaten so deep in our body politic. It is an artificial problem created by artificial people. These are problems that do not need much prayer to solve. We need to solve it ourselves by going to the streets.\u201d\n\nLack of political will:\n\nThe publisher, Daybreak newspaper and lecturer, International Institute of Journalism (IIJ), Abuja, Dr. Austin Maho, believes credible elections is a means of recruiting leadership. Dr Maho said there is no doubt that transmission of election results remains the weakest link in the nation\u2019s electoral process. He said despite the independence granted to INEC by the constitution, lawmakers in the Ninth National Assembly are attempting to subordinate the agency to its whims and caprices for selfish gains in their ongoing amendments to the Electoral Act 2010.\n\nMaho said: \u201cSince the dawn of the present democratic process in 1999, there have been attempts by successive leaders of our electoral body, INEC, to give Nigerians credible elections. Leadership recruitment process is critical to the democratic process. There would be no democracy in the real sense if votes don\u2019t count and if leadership does not reflect the wishes of the electorate. The Card Reader was a major innovation introduced by Professor Attahiru Jega as INEC chairman.\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of this innovative technology, electoral transparency improved a great deal leading to the defeat of an incumbent under whose watch the technology was deployed. A lot of people believe that the introduction of the card reader helped in no small way in bringing about the APC, Muhammadu Buhari-led administration in 2015. Buhari, a major beneficiary of the introduction of technology into our electoral process, was expected to take the step a notch further by expressly giving his support to electronic transmission of results which should be the natural follow up to the use of the card reader. This was not to be.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the electoral body has never said expressly that they cannot transmit results electronically. It is the politicians who are singing this song against the wishes of Nigerians to have electronic voting and transmission of results. The politicians have even gone further in tying the hands of the electoral body by introducing the ridiculous clause that demands that INEC should get the approval and clearance of the NCC and the National Assembly before it can determine that the network is adequate for electronic transmission of election result. They forget that INEC is an independent body that cannot be an appendage of the NCC or the National Assembly.\n\nNot rocket science:\n\n\u201cBesides, Section 52 of the Electoral Act grants the commission the power to deploy relevant technology it may require to carry out its function. INEC can, in effect, rely on this provision to transmit results electronically. The benefits of electronic transmission of election results were demonstrated in the Edo governorship election last year. And for those who kick against electronic transmission of result, Kaduna State has since 2018 demonstrated that the system is not rocket science or one that would disenfranchise rural or uneducated people.\n\n\u201cIn the recent local government elections in the state, the system was again deployed in all nooks and crannies of the state. Although there were hitches in some places, it had no overall effect on the outcome of the election. The system has shown to be easy to use as reports said it took about a minute to complete voting in a free and fair manner. It is only those who fear the outcome of a free and fair electoral process that would stand against electronic transmission of results. If we are serious as a nation in correcting the flaws in our leadership recruitment process, electronic transmission of results is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Executive Director, Adopt a Goal for Development Initiative, Ariyo Dare Atoye said deploying electronic voting on a wide scale during the 2023 general election would be disastrous. He argued that such a move would be against the globally accepted principle that an untested technology should not be deployed on a large scale.\n\nAtoye said: \u201cIt is not a case of being ripe or not. We may even have the infrastructure. But electronic voting is more demanding, tasking and sometimes complicated. Election process should be incremental. It should be incremental in terms of getting technology into our elections. If we can succeed generally in terms of electronic transmission of results, we can decide to experiment with electronic voting.\n\n\u201cI said that we may have the infrastructure but it is incremental in the sense that we must first test electronic voting in smaller elections by INEC. Elections such as the off season election like bye-elections into the Senate and House of Representatives and even some governorship bye-elections that are off cycle elections.\n\nSuccess of card reader:\n\n\u201cNow, it is when we have successfully tested this technology that we can now say that the same can be introduced in 2023. Bearing in mind that the electronic transmission of results that we are talking about has been tested in previous elections and would be tested in Anambra, Ekiti and Osun before 2023. Also, not forgetting that when we used or tested the Card Reader in the 2015 general election, it was a flop. The card reader was a flop because it was not tested in any smaller election before it was deployed in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is a universal principle that you do not deploy technology on a large scale without it being tested on a smaller scale. So, that is the whole essence of the issue of electronic voting. Electronic voting is desirable because it is quicker, faster and accurate. When there are no glitches or manipulations it is the best but one thing we have seen globally, is that people prefer use of ballot papers for elections because if electronic voting is manipulated, the consequence is that it will be difficult sometimes to be able to retrieve specific data.\n\n\u201cBut, why the ballot paper has a big advantage over electronic voting is that if there is an error in the result, ballot papers can be recounted. But in terms of electronic voting, if it is manipulated or altered, sometimes it could be very difficult to amend. There are different kinds of electronic voting machines that have been adopted in the world. None of them has been 100 per cent or even 90 per cent foolproof.\n\n\u201cIn America, they are still battling with the issue of electronic voting and some people are saying they should not even introduce it in some counties. Some counties in America have rejected electronic voting. As we speak, they want their paper trail. But the consensus globally is that results, after being collated, should be transmitted in a very simple, smart and quick way which only electronic transmission of results can guarantee. So that is the difference here.\n\nGood, but\u2026:\n\n\u201cGlobally, more countries, including those in the developed world, are doing more paper voting than even electronic voting. Electronic voting is good for smaller elections like organizational elections, parliamentary elections, etc. But when it comes to general elections, many countries favour the paper ballot over electronic voting.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the Kaduna State Government, under the Governor Nasir el-Rufai administration has used electronic voting to conduct local governments\u2019 elections twice, Atoye said that the Kaduna State local government elections where e-voting was deployed were not subjected to independent verification and validation and thus, cannot be used as a yardstick to determine the feasibility of e-voting in the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have not been able to scrutinise the Kaduna use of electronic voting. People have criticised it and people have alleged a lot of manipulations. One thing that has been very questionable about the Kaduna voting is that it has not been opened up to civil society evaluation and monitoring for them to be able to assess. For instance, one aspect of the electronic voting system in Kaduna or the processes that have been adopted that is bad is that there is what we call \u2018verification of sensitive and non-sensitive materials\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe ballot machine is a sensitive material. The opposition parties are not allowed access to monitor, to look at those things to know if they have been compromised. Some people have alleged that some of them have been preloaded. But I don\u2019t want to totally criticise what the Kaduna State Government has done in terms of electronic voting. I believe that it is not a bad place to start, as long as it could subsequently guarantee transparency and accountability in our electoral process.\u201d\n\nNASS, the last hurdle:\n\nIn summary, if the optimism of the various respondents captured in this writeup is anything to go by, one can say that electronic voting is both feasible and practicable with humongous advantages if applied in the 2023 general elections. However, its application is wholly dependent on the National Assembly, including a clause in the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill, specifically empowering INEC to conduct elections with e-voting technology and the president\u2019s assent to make the bill a law applicable in Nigeria.",
          "summary": "Its chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu said the agency\u2019s only hindrance to the deployment of electronic voting is the lack of an enabling law.\nHowever, the commission has been seeking an amendment of the legal framework that would enable electronic voting.\nIf we can succeed generally in terms of electronic transmission of results, we can decide to experiment with electronic voting.\nGood, but\u2026:\u201cGlobally, more countries, including those in the developed world, are doing more paper voting than even electronic voting.\nBut I don\u2019t want to totally criticise what the Kaduna State Government has done in terms of electronic voting.",

          "text": "Says timely dispensation of justice will enhance Nigeria\u2019s financial stability\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nThe Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad on Tuesday, said that the timely dispensation of justice will enhance financial stability in Nigeria.\n\nHe made the remarks while declaring open a Two-Day Workshop for Judicial Officers on Recent Reforms of Banking and Financial Services Law and Practice.\n\nThe workshop was organized by the National Judicial Institute (NJI) in collaboration with Juris Law and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nJustice Muhammad who stated that it is almost impossible to avoid disputes in commercial ventures, remarked that investors are more concerned about dispute resolution mechanism put in place to quickly resolve disputes that may arise in the course of business transactions between disputants.\n\nLamenting the length of time it takes to hear and decide a commercial case from trial court up to the Supreme Court, the CJN said that \u201cno investor will be happy to tie down his capital for an uncertain period of time, which may have been occasioned by commercial disputes bogged down in court\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe journey to the Supreme Court in a commercial dispute could last for as long as eight to twenty years.\n\n\u201cThis is quite disheartening and the effect of this is that the investment at stake or money in dispute would have depreciated in value such that the successful party would gain no benefit from the judgment\u201d.\n\nMuhammad however stated that if the judiciary must play its role in financial stability in Nigeria, cases of delay must be aggressively and frontally addressed so that parties will get justice at the end and the resultant effect of this will raise public confidence in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt suffices therefore to say at this point, that timely dispensation of justice by the judiciary is a critical factor that will enhance financial stability in Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nThe CJN further stated that the theme of the workshop: The Role of the Judiciary in Financial Stability in Nigeria is apposite, because it will sensitize and keep Judicial Officers abreast with new developments in this specialized area of banking law.\n\n\u201cThis workshop once again presents valuable opportunity to exchange ideas on the provisions of BOFIA 2020, as it seeks to promote a stronger, more transparent and efficient financial system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, it represents a milestone, expected to boost investors\u2019 confidence. I have had the privilege of going through the papers slated for discussion. I can assure you that you will find them rewarding.\n\nMeanwhile, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, and Chairman, Body of Bank Chief Executives, Herbert Wigwe, were given special recognition at the event.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nSeplat, Nigeria\u2019s foremost indigenous oil & gas company has disclosed its readiness to champion the quest to improve Africa\u2019s energy access by repurposing its operations with a focus on cleaner energy.\n\nThe indigenous oil concern said this flowed from the decision to make sure that the country was committed to carbon neutrality upon the realisation that something must be done by everyone concerning decarbonisation.\n\nThis emerged even as the government has pledged to partner the company to achieve its energy transition plan, comprising the universal access to energy by 2030; zero carbon emission by 2050; and industrialisation to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth,\n\nThe Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who was at the second Seplat Energy Summit, held at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, recently, where the company transitioned to an energy company with renewables and cleaner energy the priority, described the move as laudable.\n\nHe stated that the company had put the right foot forward, adding that the company, along with others would assist the country to meet its net-zero emissions plans by 2050 through the COP26 Energy Transition Council (ETC) process.\n\nRepresented by the Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, Osinbajo said Nigeria\u2019s energy transition cannot be limited to incremental steps but transformational ones.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a broader set of policies that must align with energy security, which must foster a smooth energy transition across various levels of energy demands, and gas will continue to play a critical role in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition which will create lots of opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s energy value chain.\n\n\u201cOver the next decade, every energy segment in Nigeria will be affected by this shift in energy supply and demand, \u2019\u2019he stated.\n\nSeplat Energy Plc\u2019s Chairman, Ambrose Orjiako, said to achieve the cleaner energy provision goal, the company plans, along with its associates, to replace all of the wood people use in homes with the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) which is a cleaner source of energy.\n\nThe transitioning to an energy company, the Seplat chairman said, aligns with global trends in energy transition where there is proactive planning for a world where fossil fuels will start to decline in the global energy mix .\n\nHe further stated that it was in agreement with the company\u2019s renewed focus on the entire energy value chain with an emphasis on cleaner and more sustainable forms of energy to power Nigeria.\n\nOrjiako pointed out that the company believes that gas remains the transition fuel, noting that: \u2018\u2019Seplat today delivers 50 per cent of gas needs in the country\u201d and \u201cis very aligned with the federal government\u2019s initiative in this regard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only see this increasing. Replacing diesel generators with cleaner renewable energy will solve Nigeria\u2019s power deficit,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe stated that one of the ways the company was focused on making sure the environment is well protected, aside launching its \u2018Tree for Life\u2019 project to plant trees that would create jobs and improve the environment from the first quarter of 2022, was its determined commitment towards ending gas flaring in all of its operations by 2024, six years ahead of government target.\n\nThe Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, in his comments, said the ministry endorsed Seplat Energy as the flagship company to drive Nigeria\u2019s energy transition.\n\nHe called for multiple pathways to energy transition to ensure that no country is left in the process of achieving net-zero emission by 2050.\n\nSylva noted that it was important to ensure massive efforts towards increasing energy efficiency and productivity by facilitating changes in consumption patterns and lifestyle choices which will expand renewable energy for power supply and directions within and across the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that renewable energy offers favourable prospects for localised entities, because of the complexities of technology transfer, and the intensity of the slow, and medium-scale for segments,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nOne of the keynote speakers, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and energy commentator, Daniel Yergin, who spoke on the need for the global shift from fossil fuel to other energy forms, called for more diversity in the energy mix to improve energy access. \u2018\u2019 The more diversity you have in your energy mix, the more energy security you have,\u201d he stressed.\n\nYergin took the audience on an enthralling ride on the base of his book, \u2018\u2019New Map -Energy, Climate Change and the Clash of Nations\u201d, and enlightened them on the various issues of geopolitics and energy in the era of rising political turbulence fuelled by the call for transitioning and why some countries are sceptical of the process.\n\nChief Executive Officer and Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi, in her presentation on \u2018\u201dBalancing Sustainability Revolution with Energy Poverty- Lessons from around the World\u201d, said African countries must realise the opportunities inherent in transitioning to cleaner energy to improve its access for the continent\u2019s growth.\n\nIn his intervention, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, said gas resources would help Nigeria to close the gap in the transition to clean energy.\n\nThe summit which saw Seplat unveil its new logo, had in attendance ministers, governors, members of the National Assembly, royal fathers of Seplat Energy\u2019s host communities, leaders of public and private institutions, investors, and heads of shareholder groups.\n\nRoger Brown, Seplat Energy\u2019s CEO said the name change reflected the company\u2019s belief that the greatest opportunity ahead was to supply the right mix of energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and rapidly growing population.\n\nThe summit also examined how to tackle Africa\u2019s electricity deficit against the background of the challenge of climate change with stakeholders at the summit agreeing that Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, must play a crucial role in leading the continent\u2019s energy transition as improving access to energy is essential to the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAt the first panel session during the summit, Mike Sangster, the CEO of TotalEnergies Nigeria, raised concern about the capital cost of renewable energy which he claimed is much higher than the capital cost of traditional energy, although the recurrent cost of renewable energy is cheaper.\n\nSangster said: \u201cFinancing is one of the major issues that need to be addressed\u2019\u2019, noting that most of Nigeria\u2019s renewable energy projects needed power purchase agreements that are bankable. \u201cAfrica needs more energy which must be clean and net-zero fossils, not zero fossils,\u201d Sangster said.\n\nGroup Managing Director of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX), Oscar Onyema, at the panel session, said the country needs $400 billion to power 25 million homes within 30 years through renewable energy, an aspect of attaining zero carbon emission by 2050, adding that the funding can happen through the capital market.\n\nOn access to funding, he said N750 billion was raised for investments in 2020 through bonds, and this year, it is estimated to reach N1 trillion, as he urged private firms to embrace green bonds, noting that it is a global funding means towards capital for the energy transition period.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Head of Investment Banking for the Middle East and Africa, Miguel Azevedo, said the gospel of renewable energy will force the development and creation of a democratised system for Nigeria\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\u201cIt will allow for a change in the economic and business model of Nigeria\u2019s energy sector,\u201d Azevedo said.\n\nThe panel moderator and a former Vice President of the World Bank as well as Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Arunma Oteh, who is a Non-executive Director at Seplat, said energy transition remains a challenge for everyone and enjoined all to key into Seplat\u2019s drive for clean energy.\n\nShe said there are global funding means including a N40 trillion energy access fund globally for countries driving climate change to leverage on.\n\nAlso speaking at the panel, the Executive Secretary of Nigerian Content Development Management Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote said attaining zero carbon emissions by 2050 requires capital investment, commitment, and capacity building.\n\nHowever, to attain this in 30 years, Wabote said it would mean that 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s electricity would have to come from renewable energy sources.\n\nHe noted that for oil to dominate coal for power generation, it took about 160 years in the past, adding that to attain a shift from oil to renewables in the next 30 years remains a huge task.\n\nSeplat said investors are also buying into the prospects of the company as evidenced in the continued increase in the shares of the company with about 80 per cent positive returns this year, saying this could rise as Nigeria\u2019s transition priorities present significant opportunities for the company to leverage.\n\n\u201cThese prospects range from the development of gas-to-power initiatives, development of LPG markets to alleviate the use of biomass, and development of renewable energy to serve large areas of the country not currently served by the national grid,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "China\u2019s growing influence is transforming African tech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Orlander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOrlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Orlander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Orlander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSudanese classifieds startup, alsoug has received a $5 million investment co-led by Egyptian fintech company, Fawry. The investment is the first foreign investment into the Northern African country since sanctions were lifted in 2020.\n\nalsoug is Sudan\u2019s largest classifieds marketplace and allows consumers to buy and sell products including real estate, cars, electronics, and furniture as well as services and job postings.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Tarneem Nina Saeed, the startup reportedly has nearly two million app downloads. With this investment, the startup plans to build out its payments platform, Cashi, to enable people withdraw, transfer, and deposit cash digitally.\n\nSudan\u2019s political climate has earned its pariah status internationally with the European Union placing economic sanctions on it in 1994. The U.S followed in 1997 also adding the country to its terrorism watchlist. Consequently, financial institutions were unable to offer services to the country making it difficult for business transactions.\n\nFrom 2017, the US government\u2019s stance became relaxed as processes started by former president Barack Obama to lift the economic sanctions placed on Sudan were finally completed by President Donald Trump. However, the country remained on the U.S list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nThe 2019 ouster of longtime autocrat, Omar al-Bashir accelerated Sudan\u2019s return from the wilderness with a transitional government mandated to conduct elections within 39 months.\n\nThus, Fawry\u2019s investment in alsoug could be symbolic of the country\u2019s potential and could see it become a major player in the North African tech ecosystem in the coming years. Tarneem Nina Saeed, alsoug\u2019s CEO is optimistic that the investment would herald a new dawn for the country\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis investment marks a significant milestone not just for alsoug, but for the nascent tech space in Sudan as a whole, which has until today been essentially shut out of the global capital markets. I hope this investment is the first of many and that the huge potential of the tech sector in Sudan is fully realized in the coming years.\u201d\n\nA broken payments system caused by the sanctions presents a huge opportunity for fintech startups, one that alsoug looks poised to exploit with its $5 million war chest and support from Fawry. As Eng. Ashraf Sabry, Fawry\u2019s CEO said, \u201cFawry\u2019s strategic partnership with alsoug leaves it ideally placed to help guide the platform\u2019s rollout of a countrywide payments system, a feat which Fawry has already managed through a scalable, robust, and best-in-class technology platform.\u201d\n\nThis developments could lead to numerous possibilities for the country and we would be keeping a close eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "From death to life: how a loved one\u2019s demise spurred the idea for Healthtracka",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI got a strange call that my dad slumped some years back. It was strange because my dad was the most interesting person ever. Master storyteller, healthy, ambitious, and optimistic. How did someone like that suddenly slump?\u201d\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson recounts what was the beginning of a heart-wrenching and unforgettable event in her life. It also became a major propellant for the startup she would found a few years later. But, let\u2019s dwell here a bit.\n\n\u201cThat day he slumped was the start of several long nights spent comforting and aiding my once-upon an agile father and hoping that this won\u2019t be the end. In 2018, he passed away. It was the saddest thing. The doctor would later tell us that he had diabetes and hypertension gone undiagnosed for so long. This was something a simple routine health test could have caught, I thought.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson, Healthtracka Founder Source: Supplied\n\nThe axiom \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d is one that some say has lost its importance due to constant use. However, it still holds. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in the detection, curbing, and prevention of life-threatening health challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA publication on Promoting Cancer Early Diagnosis by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that just as early diagnosis creates a marked difference in the outcome of a victim\u2019s experience with cancer \u2014 making room for the provision of care at the earliest stage possible \u2014 the same holds for all diseases. In the long run, it saves costs and lives.\n\nBut how does one access early diagnosis in low-income countries like Nigeria, where inhabitants are exposed to hospitals with an insufficient number of doctors, long wait times, inadequate care, extremely short visits with medical personnel, and poor communication?\n\nQuestions like these ran through the mind of Dare-Johnson as she nursed the idea for Healthtracka, a healthtech startup decentralising laboratory testing in Africa by providing at-home tests and digital results.\n\nFrom her degree in Biochemistry from the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, to an internship at University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Nigeria, and her father\u2019s death due to an undetected bodily ailment, Dare-Johnson had both theoretical and experiential knowledge of the importance of lab tests.\n\nBut it was not until 2020 that she threw herself entirely into working on the idea, with the COVID-19 pandemic being the final trigger.\n\n\u201cAt the point of my father\u2019s death, I knew I needed to do something about this non/late diagnosis of health issues in Africa. Most people still wait for an emergency before going in for any health tests. For some, it feels like a lot of stress to take a pause in their lives to go seek health testing. In 2020, during the pandemic, I jumped on the trigger to get up and fix these testing problems with the power of technology.\u201d\n\nThe idea felt even more feasible as she continued to brainstorm. With over a decade of work as a marketing executive in technology-based, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), eCommerce, and medical diagnostics companies, she knew it was something that she could handle. As for the technical angle, a call had to be made first.\n\nFounding Healthtracka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Amusan, Co-founder\n\nThat call was to Victor Amusan, UX Designer and Dare-Johnson\u2019s friend. It was in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time most people wondered what the viral spread of the virus would mean for many Nigerians. And here was his friend, with an idea for a lab testing product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArmed with a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Technology (FUTA), Akure, Southwest Nigeria and hungry for the next technical adventure, he and Dare-Johnson began work on Healthtracka.\n\nIn May 2021, after doing their due diligence, they launched a product that allows users to book laboratory tests. The phlebotomist comes to their homes or office to collect samples, the samples are then transported to any of the partner labs for analysis. Healthtracka users get the results in their mails, 24-48hours after sample collection. The tests available include full-body health checkups, cancer screening, and STD tests.\n\nThe startup operates an asset-light model. They partner with well-known private pathology laboratories that spearhead diagnostic testing in Nigeria. Their partner labs include vCare Diagnostics, Lancet Laboratories, and AFRIGLOBAL Medicare.\n\n\u201cOur primary mission at Healthtracka is to make health testing accessible to Africans. We launched in Lagos, Nigeria, and so far, we have seen the viability of this product. With word-of-mouth and customer reviews being a major marketing tool for us. And our primary source of revenue is commissions.\u201d\n\nA visit to the startup\u2019s website showed that the average pricing for a test is \u20a615,000 ($36.52). I wondered aloud how affordable this is for the average Nigerian, and Dare-Johnson says it\u2019s the lowest they arrived at after market research.\n\n\u201cI believe a person\u2019s health is of maximum priority. After our market research, taking into consideration the equipment it costs to carry out these tests, plus logistics, that\u2019s the lowest we could come to. All babies grow, right? We\u2019re still at our early stage, and what\u2019s top priority now is gaining traction; as we evolve with time, maybe we can afford to beat down pricing.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s offering is similar to APEX Medical Labs in Malawi and MDaaS Global in Nigeria, which operate an eDiagnostic service. But, Dare-Johnson says that Healthtracka\u2019s offering is unique in many ways.\n\n\u201cOur approach is different as we offer on-demand, at-home testing online. Our phlebotomists are highly trained sample collectors and able to reach people wherever they are. The lab is coming to people\u2019s doorstep with Healthtracka. Currently, we haven\u2019t identified any direct competitors but collaborators, and we are focused on leveraging the existing infrastructure in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRunning as an African female founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson\n\nFor most female founders in the tech space, getting funding is difficult compared to their male counterparts. In 2020, a Briter Bridges report revealed that African startups raised at least $1.3 billion in disclosed funding and female tech entrepreneurs raised only 20.1% \u2014 $261.3m \u2014 of the total investment recorded.\n\nBeyond the shores of Africa, this imbalance persists. Female founders have a harder time securing funding, even in the US, where it is believed that social progress exists. Some women-focused VC firms have launched to fill these gaps for female founders and underrepresented groups.\n\nIn 2020, FirstCheck Africa, a female-led, female-focused angel fund and investor community, launched as a medium to help African women quickly access funding. Dare-Johnson shares that they are one of her key investors and early backers.\n\n\u201cWe are venture-backed by amazing angel investors such as FirstCheck Africa as well as investments from family and friends. They launched around the time we were working on the idea, and I had my eyes fixed on them, knowing it was an encouragement and support I\u2019d need ahead of our launch.\u201d\n\nShe also shares that another challenge they\u2019ve faced is getting people to believe that at home health tests can be carried out.\n\n\u201cPeople found it hard to believe that lab tests can be done at home, especially in Nigeria, but because we were lucky to find our early adopters who basically jumped on the offer to test at the comfort of their homes, word and reviews began to spread like wildfire. And just recently we carried out our 1000th test.\u201d\n\nGoing forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthtracka team\n\nEvery startup founder wants their company to grow, eventually becoming a household name among locals, and Dare-Johnson is not exempt. For her, the most exciting part of the journey has been witnessing the massive potential of the business and being a part of the solution to the challenges in Africa\u2019s health sector.\n\n\u201cThe health tech industry in Africa is ripe for disruption and radical innovation. The problems are numerous; the onus lies on us to find these solutions that can scale with technology. It is really inspiring to see amazing health tech companies owning the spaces and fixing their slice of the problems.\u201d\n\nPlans for the future include growing, increasing user-base strength, and expanding across Africa. As part of this, the startup recently opened a branch in the Southwestern Nigerian city of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to reach Africans in every corner they are, not only Nigerians but the entire population in Africa. Africans abroad inclusive as well who still need to keep tabs on their family\u2019s health care. Healthtracka wants to bring the lab to your doorstep wherever you are.\u201d\n\nHealthcare is an essential part of life, and startups creating access in various ways are in demand. It would not be out of place to expect that with time, the healthtech sector will see more players digitising solutions to the problems Africa faces with the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there!\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nMono\u2019s Series A\n\nDigital gender gap\n\nAirtel Money\u2019s spend now and pay later service\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: In the Techpoint Digest for yesterday, October 10, 2021, we stated that \u201conly 10% of West African startups with a female co-founder have raised $1 million.\u201d which was somewhat misleading.\n\nA more accurate statement would be, \u201conly 10% of West African startups with a female co-founder raised over $1 million between 2010 and 2019\u201d, as it clearly states the timeframe for funding activities in Women-led startups. You can check out this piece for more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono announces $15m Series A to speed up growth in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMono Team\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, October 11, 2021, African fintech startup, Mono, announced a $15m Series A. This round follows a $2 million seed raised in May.\n\nAmerican investment firm Tiger Global led this round, with participation from SBI Investment, Target Global and General Catalyst, all first-time investors in Mono. Returning investors include Ingressive Capital, Entree Capital, Golden Palm Investment Corporation (GPIC), Lateral Capital, and Acuity VC.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Mono? Mono is a fintech API that serves as a source for financial data. They aggregate data like income, account statements, real-time balance, customer spending patterns, and historical transactions into a single API for financial firms and third-party developers.\n\nHold on a bit: A month after the startup launched, it raised a $500k pre-seed in September 2020, then a $2m seed in May 2021. This amounts to $17.5 million in funding disclosed so far. If funds raised in investment rounds connotes traction, then Mono seems to be growing. Although, in most cases, traction reflects more in user-base growth and revenue.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Mono\u2019s CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, former Product Manager at Paystack , shared that not only has Mono partnered with 270 businesses and developers in processing over 200 million financial data transactions, they have also seen a 45x year-on-year growth in connecting bank accounts and a 10x revenue increase since their pre-seed in May.\n\nCoupled with a recent expansion to Ghana and a planned foray into Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt, Hassan says that most of Mono\u2019s moves are primarily based on customers\u2019 requests, as they have built a reputation amongst customers. With this funding, they\u2019re looking to develop solutions for non-tech and traditional industries and establish a footprint in five African countries by next year.\n\nThis article provides some much-needed context on Mono and the growing sub-sector it\u2019s playing in: Why API-led fintech startups are becoming a big deal in Nigeria\n\nCountries lose $1 trillion from the digital gender gap in over a decade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in tech. Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://www.instagram.com/guzeartworld_photography/\u201d target=\u201d_ blank\u201d rel=\u201dnoopener noreferrer\u201d>Guzeartworld Photography</a>\n\nSurprise, surprise? Issues like gender imbalance in education, unequal pay, and the exclusion of women in economic activities and innovative processes seem to be over-flogged discussions, and by now, you\u2019d expect a rapid change in policies to address these gaps. Sadly that is not the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye-bye money: On Monday, October 11, 2021, the World Wide Web Foundation and Alliance for Affordable Internet(A4AI) released a report on the Economic Consequences of the Digital Gender Gap, and it was found that lower-middle-income countries have lost an estimated $1 trillion in GDP due to digital gender gap in over a decade.\n\nWhat is the digital gender gap? It is the aspect of the digital divide \u2014 the division of people into the connected and unconnected and disparity in access to technology \u2014 that exists as a result of gender differences. The report shows that globally, women are disproportionately excluded from the Internet, with 52% of men likely to be online than women.\n\nBut why does it exist? This gap exists for both intentional and unintended reasons, which include inequalities in education and digital skills, social norms that discourage women and girls from being online, privacy, safety, and security.\n\nFrom the 32 countries surveyed, one-third of women were connected to the Internet, translating into a $24 billion loss in tax revenue annually. To dig up these figures, the report reviewed 70% of the collective GDPs of these countries and paired it with existing data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). You can find the full report here.\n\nGoing forward: In a constantly evolving world, the need for digital inclusion is crucial, and we cannot build solid walls for the future if one part is left out.

          "title": "What Nigeria must consider to devalue Naira",
          "text": "The push for a fully market determined foreign exchange rates regime in Nigeria will be meaningless without addressing many other issues that have brought the country\u2019s economy to its knees, according to Uche Uwaleke, a professor of finance at Nasarawa State University.\n\nThe university teacher says this approach would ensure that the gains of a revamped foreign exchange market are reflected in the economy to allow Nigeria break what has become a vicious cycle of unending devaluation of the naira without real benefits.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo sparked a fresh debate on the management of the foreign exchange market on Monday when he spoke at a ministerial retreat where he canvassed the idea of devaluing the naira.\n\nHowever, Uwaleke said the implications of devaluing the naira now are quite scary.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Vice President obviously means well; but have we thought of the impact it would have on pump price of fuel and the multiplier effects?\n\n\u201cHow about the knock-on effects with regards to inflation and interest rates especially at a time when inflation rate remains elevated? Is high inflation rate not inimical to investments whether local or foreign?\u201d Uwaleke asked.\n\nFrom CBN published reports, NNPC used to fund the CBN reserves with over $3 billion per month from sale of crude oil. This contributed immensely to stabilising the exchange rate. BusinessDay learnt that in more than four months NNPC has not funded the reserves by a single dollar.\n\nThe don said the argument that a string of naira devaluations will incentivise foreign investors remains to be tested in the Nigerian context as other factors such as falling government revenues in the era of rising oil prices, inflation, and insecurity equally play a huge part.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s artificially low exchange rate requires rethink \u2013 Osinbajo\n\nAnalysts say Nigeria has many more battles to contend with, the key of which is the reality that for months the national oil company has not made any contribution to either government revenues or to foreign exchange accretion.\n\nAccording to leading economist, Ayo Teriba, increasing foreign exchange supply is the only enduring way to achieve naira stability, adding that \u201cfighting over exchange rate premium distracts us from concentrating on how to raise large sums from global asset-based securities like progressive developing countries are doing,\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe should learn that it is just as futile to try to curtail demand for forex as it is to try to control the price of forex. Supply of forex is the only variable that we should be trying to boost,\u201d Teriba said.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we refocus our efforts on how to substantially boost foreign exchange supply into Nigeria, through balance-sheet-related foreign exchange inflows that are fuelled by the unprecedented global liquidity glut, rather than transactions-related foreign exchange inflows that are adversely affected by weakening global commodity prices, the better,\u201d Teriba said.\n\n\u201cMost other oil exporting developing countries have shifted from relying on oil exports for foreign exchange supply towards asset-based securities that is helping them to attract bigger net foreign exchange inflows than oil could ever have brought even in the best of times.\n\n\u201cFighting over exchange rate premium distracts us from concentrating on how to raise large sums from global asset-based securities like progressive developing coun- tries are doing,\u201d he added.\n\nA source at the Central Bank said devaluing the naira at this time will create more problems than solutions for Nigeria in the short term.\n\nThe source explained that government debt service which is already over 70 percent of revenues, will cross 100 percent easily as \u201cNigeria\u2019s FX loans will be immediately repriced (higher interest rates) and terms will be made much tougher. This could lead to widespread defaults, higher NPLs and financial system instability,\u201d the source added.\n\nAccording to the source, fixed income earners, which include all government workers, will see their real wages (take home pay minutes inflation) evaporate into thin air.\n\nThe same pay they got last month, which they were already struggling to use to make ends meet, will simply buy less than half of what it bought them last month.\n\n\u201cThis could ignite justifiable calls for salary increases and could cause social unrest, in a country where tensions are already high,\u201d the source said.\n\nAccording to one analyst, \u201cwhy is it that 80 percent of cargo ships and planes that bring goods to Nigeria (for which we pay dollars) leave our shores empty (implying we do not earn dollars from potential exports of goods they would have carried)?\n\n\u201cDoes the Nigerian Custom Service consider itself a trade facilitation agency or a revenue generating one? If they are a trade facilitation agency, has anyone seen their strategic plans to improve Nigeria\u2019s international trade and ability to earn FX?\u201d\n\nAnother economist asked, \u201cwhat is the government doing to improve our healthcare systems and ensure we reverse the need for Nigerians to seek medical treatment abroad even for routine checks? We can save up to $2 billion annually from this and the Naira could strengthen on account of this.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cin the 80s and 90s, the typical basket of food Nigerians ate was almost totally made in Nigeria. Our clothes were made here with cotton from our farmers, textiles from our mills and embroidery from our tailors. Our cars used tires made here.\n\n\u201cThe cars themselves were made either in Kaduna (Peugeot) or Lagos (Volkswagen). Today, we spend billions of dollars annually importing anything and everything! What is the government\u2019s plan to reverse this trend? Can we begin by requiring that over the next 3-5 years, all government vehicles be made in Nigeria by Innoson Motors or any other car manufacturers? If we can reverse up to 40 percent, the Naira would strengthen to N70/$1.\n\n\u201cOver the last 3-5 years, more than 5,000 men have relocated their families to Canada or other places for \u201cbetter\u201d life. And this trend has continued unabated with no end in sight. Whilst these men are here earning Naira, their major expenses are in dollars for family upkeep, mortgages, car loans etc. This means we have more than 5,000 new men chasing dollars every day, every week, every month. Imagine if the country gave them some hope to believe and stay, the Naira would be strengthened to N25/$1.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s problems are significant but fixable. The solutions are staring us in the face. We just have to be honest and work diligently to solve them rather than make cheap political statements aimed at scapegoating,\u201d the source said.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC, said, \u201cI believe the main thrust of the Vice President\u2019s comment is not about Naira value being kept artificially low but actually about multiple foreign exchange rates and windows which create market distortions and discourage inflows of foreign exchange especially FDI. This continues to put pressure on our external reserve in a manner that is unsustainable if not reversed.\n\n\u201cOur reality today is that Nigeria\u2019s forex receipt is less than what is needed to meet demand whether legitimate, speculative or otherwise. While it is true that fx for illegal activities are being sourced from the parallel market, there are also legitimate transactions like importation of raw materials which are listed as prohibited from accessing fx in the official market. This effectively gives credence to the parallel market as an alternative window rather than a black market for illegal transactions and speculative demand which can be ignored.\n\n\u201cThis also speaks to the Vice President\u2019s comment on the need for coordination and collaboration between agencies including monetary and fiscal authorities. If we intend to discourage the importation of certain items then the fiscal authority could impose higher import tariff progressively as local substitutes become available.\n\n\u201cWe can then allow all legitimate transactions to access the official forex market and let market forces determine the exchange rate. As a long term solution, we need to address impediments to local production of many items which are currently being imported while boosting export earnings through non-oil sources including services. We also need to address petrol subsidy which constitutes the biggest strain on our fx demand used for fuel importation which unfortunately seems to benefit corruption agents far more than ordinary Nigerians,\u201d Oyedele said",

          "text": "Forty percent of employees in Nigeria\u2019s informal sector, are owed wages, a situation that is worsening poverty in Africa\u2019s largest economy, according to a new report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based geopolitical risk analysis firm.\n\nDelayed and unpaid salaries is a recurring problem in Nigeria\u2019s labour market but it has become worse at this time when the Covid-19 pandemic eroded the revenue of businesses leaving millions poorer.\n\nAccording to the report titled \u2018Between the Lines: A Look into Delayed & Unpaid Wages in Nigeria\u2019s Informal sector\u2019 which surveyed 3,416 respondents, the sector is largely unregulated; making many malpractices go unnoticed, tucked away from the public discourse, and often without consequence.\n\n\u201cGiven the seeming absence of regulation in the sector, the payment of wages is greatly dependent on the discretion of employers,\u201d the report further stated.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst adds that people being owed salaries might lead to higher incidence of poverty because they will struggle to pay for the basic needs of life. \u201cIt is devastating at a time where we are seeing sustained increase in the prices of commodities and services.\u201d\n\nUnlike the informal sector, the issue of unpaid wages in the formal sector is reported. This is because its workers are covered by labour laws, have more organised work unions, and are mostly aware of their rights, things that informal sector workers lack.\n\nRead Also: Improving credit access for Nigeria\u2019s informal sector using data, collaboration\n\nA breakdown of the report showed that out of the respondents who were owed wages, 43 percent were owed wages for up to three months followed by 29 percent owed between four-six months, 15 percent were owed between seven-10 months wages and five percent were owed between 16-20 months salaries.\n\nAlso, Ondo, Abia, Ebonyi, Plateau, Imo, Bauchi, Enugu, Oyo, Ekiti and Benue are the states with the highest percentages of informal workers who are owed wages.\n\n\u201cEmployees are largely unaware of their rights and prevailing labour laws. In cases where the employees are knowledgeable about extant laws, they are discouraged by the cost of justice (resources and length of time) and unequal power dynamics between them and their employers,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe report also highlighted that owed salaries led to cases where employees resort to stealing, running parallel businesses (side hustles) and other problematic behaviours, in a bid to compensate for their unpaid or delayed wages.\n\nA 42 year-old male respondent told SBM field researchers that \u201che must go out every day as he cannot risk staying at home\u201d. He expressed hope that in the course of his current job, he would find better opportunities which, according to him, would be unavailable if he were not working.\n\nAnother respondent, a 24-year-old sales girl, complained that her employer had not paid her because they were unimpressed by the volume of sales and would only do so when the market picked up.\n\nJennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered Recruitment and Training Consultancy advised that each government constituent needs to enforce some form of policy or body like a labour union to govern the informal sector that is the only waythey can have some sort of regulatory processes to ensure that they are paid.\n\nIn addition to establishing policies and regulatory bodies designed to operate as checks to the informal sector, SBM recommends that creating awareness as to the rights of employees is a major way to ensure that policies are adhered to, considering that many employees in the sector are unaware of their protection by labour laws.",

          "text": "Rationalisation of generous concessions, expenditure, implementation of other tax reforms, and increasing tax base can help cash-strapped Nigeria raise as much as N10 trillion, according to the World Bank.\n\nWith the additional revenue Nigeria could generate from the areas cited by the Washington-based bank, Africa\u2019s most populous nation could offset its projected 2022 budget deficit of N6.26 trillion and would be left with an extra revenue of N3.74 trillion.\n\n\u201cIn the next three years, such measures can raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to about 7 percent and bring in as much as N10 trillion,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nBreaking down the measures, the international lender said Nigeria would need to \u201cincrease \u2018sin taxes,\u2019 rationalising tax expenditures, removing loopholes in tax laws, and improving tax compliance with more disciplined revenue administration.\u201d\n\nEstimated at 4.3 percent in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio remains way below that of peers like South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana, at 26.7percent, 15.9 percent, and 12 percent, respectively.\n\nRead also: Low-Income Country debt rises to record $860bn in 2020 says World Bank\n\nAs Nigeria tries to \u201cbuild back better\u201d after the COVID crisis through its 2022 \u201cBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\u201d, the World Bank said a more strategic approach to revenue mobilization will also be necessary: \u201cnot just taxing more, but taxing better; not just how much to collect, but how to collect, what to collect, and from whom.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) pointed out during the public budget presentation on Monday that despite the country\u2019s huge tax base of 41 million taxpayers, Nigeria generated less than N1trn in tax revenue in 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax revenue compares poorly to South Africa\u2019s, which has a tax base of around 4 million people, yet produced N13trn in revenue last year.\n\n\u201cThat latter appears understated: newswire reports indicate that South Africa actually earned c.USD85bn (cNGN35trn) in the fiscal year ending Mar \u201921,\u201d FBN Quest analysts said Tuesday.\n\nIn the longer term, fundamental reforms of the tax system will be necessary to stimulate post-pandemic investment and economic growth, the World Bank said in its latest update report for Nigeria.\n\nAnalysts believe now may be the right time for Nigeria to cut its cost on less impactful expenditure, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the already weak economy.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has added more pressure on already subdued domestic revenue and threatens to push Nigeria further into deficit,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s projected 2022 budget deficit of N6.26 trillion is larger than the country\u2019s entire 2016 budget, analysts believe the funding gap could be higher if Nigeria sticks to its expenditure plan.\n\nThis is because if the projected revenue of N10.13 trillion follows the trajectory of previous targets, the country could end up with less. In the last five years, Nigeria has attained an average of 55 percent revenue performance, the reason why analysts have criticized the government for raising the bar each year despite obvious challenges in attaining revenue targets.\n\nIf the case is the same next year, Nigeria could be looking at a revenue of about N5.57 trillion and a budget deficit of about N10.82 trillion at the end of the fiscal year, almost the size of the country\u2019s entire budget in 2020.\n\nThough on the rise, the successive drop in oil and gas revenue, especially at the peak of the pandemic, in addition to the adverse impacts on other revenue streams which forced households to consume less, corporate profits to report decline will likely reduce VAT collections and corporate income tax (CIT)\u2014two of the largest sources of non-oil revenue, the lender said.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has also reduced the scope for tax administration enforcement actions, and minimal use of automation in tax administration precluded any leveraging of technology to improve compliance,\u201d it added.\n\nWhile COVID-19 wrought many challenges, the World Bank said \u201cit also brings about a rare opportunity to make changes that could give revenues a major boost in the long run.

          "text": "Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai has presented the 2022 draft budget of N233 billion to Kaduna State House of Assembly.\n\nThe budget has a capital expenditure of N146 billion and recurrent spending of N87.6 billion.\n\nSpeaking during the presentation of the draft budget on Tuesday, the governor noted that the allocations in the 2022 budget estimates reflect the political values and governance principles that have consistently guided the six previous budgets that his government has presented.\n\nGiving a further breakdown of the N233billion budget estimate, the governor disclosed that it has a capital to recurrent ratio of 63% : 37%.\n\nEl Rufai said the 2022 estimates are slightly smaller than the 2021 budget of N237.52bn, which had N157.56bn as capital and N79.96bn recurrent expenditure, a 66% to 34% capital to recurrent ratio.\n\nHe further said that the priorities of the 2022 estimates are on Education, Healthcare and Infrastructure, like previous budgets.\n\n\u201cMost of the capital spending will be in the Economic and Social Sectors, in keeping faith with our stated governance agenda. We propose to devote 76.8% of the capital budget to schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, including housing. Capital spending on Education is N68.4bn (29%) and for Health N35.1bn (15%),\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, these figures show that the 2022 draft budget estimates express their political values and governance principles in the same consistent manner as their six previous budgets.\n\nJustifying the allocations, El Rufai said that they will \u201censure that the urban renewal programme, the largest ever infrastructure investments in Kaduna state will be completed, along with initiatives in the health and education sectors\u201d.\n\nRecalling some of the achievements of the last six years, the governor expressed appreciation to the Kaduna State House of Assembly for the close partnership that has enabled the government to innovate and drive progressive outcomes in the state",

Our Generation.\u201d emphasizes the imperativeness of digital literacy and inclusivity for the Girl Child.\n\nAccording to experts, the Covid-19 pandemic has migrated the world from physical engagement to a virtual platform.\n\nThe pandemic has also transformed the world into a digital village as school learnings, business earnings, and social connecting are now being done via digital platforms.\n\nThis has also transformed the future of work as existing jobs are being modified, and new ones are emerging at the frontiers of our economies, which require knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).\n\nBut over 2.2 billion people below the age of 25 (mostly girls) still do not have access to the internet at home, meaning girls are most likely to be cut off.\n\nAlso, the gender gap for global internet users grew from 11 percent in 2013 to 17 percent in 2019 while in the world\u2019s least developed countries, it hovers around 43 percent.\n\nThe implication of this is that girls are also less likely than boys to use and own devices, and gain access to tech-related skills and jobs.\n\nExperts believe addressing the inequity and exclusion that spans geographies and generations is vital as we seek to usher in a digital revolution for all, and with all.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa, therefore, called on government and relevant authorities to increase access to digital education and devices for girls, while also demanding that all schools be equipped with functional state-of-the-art digital laboratories to boost access to digital literacy for girls.",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

He listed the clauses that required action as 43,52,62,87.\n\nSection 87 deals with the method of primaries to be adopted by political parties.\n\nThe Senate had earlier adopted during the amendment of the electoral act that parties should adopt either direct or indirect primaries.\n\nHowever, based on the observation by its INEC Committee, the lawmakers supported direct primaries while some others did not.\n\nSenator Adamu AlIero supported direct primaries arguing that it will strengthen and deepen democracy and will make the electoral process transparent. He said it will elongate a system where money bags will hijack the process.\n\nHowever, based on the observation by its INEC Committee, the Senate opted for a repeal of the section to select a specific method of primaries. Some lawmakers support direct primaries while some others do not.\n\nSenator Adamu AlIero argued in favour of direct primaries, saying that it will strengthen and deepen democracy and will make the electoral process transparent.\n\nHowever, Senator Smart Adeyemi disagreed, throwing his support for indirect primaries.\n\nAccording to Senator Adeyemi, indirect primaries is better for the country because the majority of party members are illiterate and they will need enlightenment if they are going to be asked to come out and vote.

So the question is, as the virus is changing, it may require that we need to give you more than two doses,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\n\u201cYou may require a booster which is the first, second and subsequent doses because we have also discovered that even though the vaccine stops you from getting seriously sick, it may not necessarily stop you from catching Covid.\n\n\u201cWe do know that some people even who are fully vaccinated with two doses will still catch Covid and some people will get quite sick and occasionally, some people may die. But certainly, the people that are dying who are not vaccinated are much higher than the people who are dying who have been vaccinated.\n\nREAD ALSO: El-Rufai Presents Proposed N233bn 2022 Budget To Kaduna Assembly\n\nProfessor Abayomi explained that the state government plans to vaccinate 30 percent of Lagos residents by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to him, scientists around the world are toying with the idea that a third or fourth dose may be required.\n\nMeanwhile, the members of the Diplomatic Community in Lagos have scored the state government high on its COVID-19 response and management effort which have seen the nation\u2019s commercial capital overcome three successive waves of the global pandemic.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Professor Abayomi, members of the Diplomatic communities agreed that the Lagos State Government has done a lot to mitigate the scourge of the infection while pledging to continue to offer support to the COVID19Lagos response directly and indirectly.\n\nIn her remarks, the Consul General of France in Nigeria, Laurence Monmayrant said she is impressed by the biosecurity facilities that were put in place at IDH by the State Government to prosecute the war against the global pandemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed by what I have seen today, I enjoyed the visit because this is really something we\u2019ve been looking at since the beginning of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen that Lagos State has done a lot,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut it is one thing to read and see it in the media report and it is another thing to come and see on the spot what is happening here, so it was a very interesting day here today.\n\nShe harped on the need to ensure that more citizens are vaccinated as a way to mitigate the new wave of the pandemic.",

I didn\u2019t involve anybody. I don\u2019t know who must have come into the apartment. Definitely, somebody did but I don\u2019t who the person is.

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has arraigned the former Chairman of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for Recovery of Public Property (SPIP), Mr. Okoi Ofem Obono-Obla, over allegations of certificate forgery.\n\nThe Commission, in a two-count charge filed at the Jos Judicial Division of the High Court of Plateau State, maintained its allegations that the former SPIP head presented a fake result with a credit pass in English Literature to the University of Jos, with which he secured admission to read law.\n\nThe charge filed before Justice C. L. Dabup, revealed that while Obono-Obla did not sit for the Ordinary Level, General Certificate Examination (GCE) in English Literature in 1982, he presented a result of the same GCE to the University of Jos, in 1985, containing Credit 6 from Mary Knoll College, Ogoja.\n\nHe was alleged to have committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 366 of the Penal Code Law of Plateau State.\n\nObono-Obla entered a not guilty plea on each of the two-count when they were read to him, following which his counsel, M.A. Agara, filed an application praying the court to grant him bail on self-recognizance.\n\nAgara had earlier filed a motion contesting the jurisdiction of the court on the matter as well as accused the prosecution of bringing a defective charge before the court and prayed the court not to allow the charge to be read to the defendant.\n\nICPC\u2019s lead Counsel, Henry Emore, who opposed the motion challenging the jurisdiction of the court, submitted that the defendant was brought before the court because the offense of certificate forgery was allegedly committed in Jos where the court sits.\n\nHe however did not oppose the bail application, but urged the court to admit him to bail on stringent terms.\n\nJustice Dabup, in her ruling on the bail application, admitted Obono-Obla to bail in the sum of N1 million with one surety in like sum. She further ruled that the surety must be resident within the jurisdiction of the court and must submit an affidavit of means including a tax clearance certificate showing evidence of payment for three years. The case has been adjourned to 25th November, 2021 for trial.",

          "text": "Tribute by the National Democratic Coalition to Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu at the Lagos Airport Hotel, October 12th 2021\n\nHow would the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO present to the public, the most outstanding and rear qualities of our departed but distinguished publicly spirited, humble but disciplined, impactful, indefatigable and difficult to replace National Chairman, a gentleman Naval topmost leader, a former member of both the Supreme Military Council (SMC) as well as the Armed Forces Ruling Council, AFRC, First Military Administrator of the Old Big Imo State (Abia and Imo States) and Military Governor of the Lagos State known as the Centre of Excellence and the Economic Nerve Centre of the geographical/political pace called Nigeria and above all a patriot and nationalist.\n\n\u201cTribute to the dead is meaningless. Corpses are 3D \u2013 dead, deaf and dumb. Only the living can appreciate their tributes. If only we tell the living the sweet things we tell their corpses, some would have lived longer or happier. If you have swallowed pleasantries to your beloved ones, start vomiting them right away to avoid food poisoning or constipation. When do you prefer your tribute, dead or alive?\u201d \u2015 Vincent Okay Nwachukwu, Weighty \u2018n\u2019 Worthy African Proverbs \u2013 Volume 1\n\nAdmiral Kanu you were born on November 3, 1943 at Ovim, now Abia State which was part of the old Imo State which you later governed as its first Chief Executive and went through Methodist Primary School, Enugu and Central School, Ovim, (1949- 56) and Metropolitan College, Onitsha, 1957-61 for your primary and secondary education. At 21, you enlisted in to the Nigerian Navy. In 1962; you were a student at National Defence Academy, Kharakvasla, India; Naval Engineering and Electrical College, India; Indian Naval Ships, Venduruthy and Cochin, India, 1962-67; Defence Services Staff College, India and New Port War College, Rhodes Island, USA, 1985. You in fact earned a B.Sc. 1981 from the National Defence Academy and a Master of Science from University of Madras. For you brilliance and intellectual prowess, you were the Best All-Round Cadet in 1965, Best Midshipman (1st Class) Pass Staff College, Forces Service Star. You were in your retirement given an Honoris Causa by Abia State University.\n\nIn your professional career, you were at various times the Chief of Operations, (COOP), Naval Headquarters, and Chief of Administration and Logistics, Ministry of Defence, 1990 respectively. You retired voluntarily from the Nigerian Navy in 1990.\n\nAs a civilian, your public spiritedness was manifested in your love and desire to make life better for your people in particular and Nigeria which you have served meritoriously and patriotically. You were a member of Ime Obi (inner caucus) of Ohaneze Ndigbo.\n\nYou were an author of two books: The Nigerian Military and Civil War, 1993, The Military, Politics and Human Rights and the Economy; The Way forward: Sovereign National Conference, 1993.\n\nAs a gentleman soldier that you were, you got totally committed to the efforts being initiated for national reconciliation so that Nigeria could follow the right course desirable to reduce to the barest minimum, national mutual mistrust, political instability and the wrongly headed government policies that had resulted into unfairness, injustice, inequity, and wanton disregard for the defence and promotion of the rule of law.\n\nThe trajectory of your daily existence since you voluntarily resigned your commission from the Nigerian Navy gave indications that you understood your divine purpose in life and perhaps was conscious of the following philosophical sayings:\n\n\u201cNo man can be ignorant that he must die, nor be sure that he may not this very day\u2014 Marcus Tullius Gcero, 106-43 BC, Roman statesman in\u201d De Senoctute C. 78 BC\n\n\u201cHow do you die is the most important thing you ever do. It\u2019s the exit, the final scene of the glorious epic of your life. It\u2019s the third act and, you know everything builds up to the third act.\u201d Timothy Leary, 1920-96, American Psychologist \u2014 (In the Guardian December 2, 1995)\n\n\u201cI am always grieved when a man of real talent dies. The world needs such men more than Heaven does\u201d Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, 1742 -99, German Scientist and writer\u2014 (Aphorismen 1902 -8)\n\n\u201cBetter a thousand times to die with glory than live without honour\u201d Louis VI (Louis the Fat), 1078-1137, King of France. AND\n\n\u201cCarve your name on hearts, not tombstones. A legacy is etched into the minds of others and the stories they share about you.\u201d \u2015 Shannon Alder\n\nNADECO is in a position to declare to all and sundry that no sooner than you hanged your Military Uniform that you immediately transited into a statesman, public opinion moulder and a dependable leader who was determined to make positive impact on the lives of people, your Igbo Nation and Nigeria generally, as the following historical facts confirm this assertion.\n\nHANDSHAKE ACROSS THE NIGER\n\nThis effort initiated by the Igbo Nation for productive discussion with the Yoruba Nation was led by Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe (Ochiagha Ochimba) ably assisted by your goodself. Chief Christian C. Onoh, former Governor of the Old Anambra State, Chief R. B. K. Okafor, Prof. Anya O. Anya, Alhaji Abdulazeez Chibuzor Ude and a host of other eminent Igbo Leaders became the most important result oriented event between 1991-1993.\n\nAfter two meetings between the Igbo and Yoruba nations first in General Adeyinka Adebayo\u2019s Ikeja GRA Residence and Chief Sunny Odogu\u2019s Asaba residence respectively, the leadership reached out to and invited the Middle Belt to the group next meeting which held in the home of Alhaji S. O. G. Gbadamosi at Ikorodu. And the movement was then named as the Council for Unity and Understanding, C. U. U. The CUU became the most popular, respected, nation-wide platform, with retired most senior public officials, Military and Civilian, Professional groups, Civil Society Organizations, Women, Youth and Students, Traditional and Religious Leaders, Trade Unions etc. upon which the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO was constructed. The main objective of NADECO was for the purposes of being able to organize a credible campaign for the convocation of a sovereign National Conference to discuss and resolve the unanswered NATIONAL QUESTION and the DE-ANNULMENT of the Presidential victory of Chief M.K.O. Abiola at the June 12, 1993 Presidential Election which was provocatively, insensitively and contemptuously annulled by the Gen. Ibrahim Babangida led military dictatorship.\n\nAdmiral Kanu, you were one of the three ad hoc members that the larger meeting mandated to craft a name which eventually became the National Democratic Coalition with final impute from the erudite second National Leader, Chief Anthony Eromosele Enahoro. Again, you were one of the five ad hoc committee members that crafted the Communique, and Resolution with which NADECO was presented to the Nigerian public and the International Community in May 1994. Furthermore, at the first special meeting of the Steering Committee of NADECO, you were elected/appointed as the Chairman of the ALL PURPOSES WORKING COMMITTEE to act on behalf of the Steering Committee in between its meetings.\n\nI can testify to all people that NADECO achieved so much because of your dedication, commitment and sacrifice. Your house and office were the epic centres and theatres of NADECO\u2019s reknown great exploits which the Abacha Junta could not confront nor subverted.\n\nFor your patriotism and undisguised commitment to the pursuit of NADECO\u2019s goals and objectives, you were humiliated, hounded, dehumanized by the Abacha junta in spite of your being very superior in military hierarchy to them, the upstarts, politicians in military uniform who for ignoble and selfish purposes consistently exploited the weak link of the politicized army to stage their various military insurrections against the sitting governments.\n\nNADECO cannot but revealed to the public in this tribute that the Abacha security clique searched your Idowu Martins, Victoria Island home for arms but found nothing. Yet not contented with that effrontery, the security errand boys escorted you to Ovim, Abia State to equally search your home but equally found nothing incriminating. Furthermore, you were briefly detained for some hours at both the Kam Salem Police Headquarters Annex and Alagbon Intelligence and Investigation Centre before you were bailed out by your wife Mrs. Gladys Godwin Kanu; now your widow.\n\nIn spite of all the oppressive measures taken against you, you remained unperturbed and unbowed until this your sudden and difficult to manage departure to the other address. Eventually, at the death of Senator Abraham Adesanya, you were unanimously elected as the National Chairman of NADECO. You carried the burden and the trust of the organization with great dedication, consistency, dignity and sacrifice until you were recalled home suddenly by your maker, the Almighty God on January 13, 2021 after a brief illness. When most other colleagues of yours fell threatened by Abacha\u2019s security misguided attacks and they either switched camp or kept to themselves, you exhibited courage to stand for the conviction of your heart.\n\nAdmiral Kanu, your life bore the hallmarks of those rare gems who understood their callings. For example, Percy Bysshe Shelley, 17 92-1822, English Poet declared that:\n\n\u23af \u201cPeace is in the grave. The grave hides all things beautiful and good. I am a God and cannot find it there. Death is the veil which those who live call life; They sleep, and it is lifted\u201d\n\n\u23af Edmund Spenser, C. 152 -99 English Poet says: \u201cSleep after toil, port after stormy seas, Ease after War, death after life, does greatly please\n\n\u23af Elizabeth Barret Browning, 1806-61, English poet states \u201cA great man, leaves clean work behind him, and requires No sweeper up of the chips\u201d.\n\nAs for your service to humanity, you were a friend to the high and to the low, you never got involved in the crude accumulation of wealth associated with most of your colleagues who hold political appointments.\n\nAlso, you were a practicing Christian who love the Lord and used your retirement benefit to build a Methodist Church in Ovim, your home town and you were an explanary father to your children and a devoted husband to your wife till death did you part.\n\nYour position as the credible, impressive and irrepressible National Chairman will be difficult to fill, but we, whom you are living behind are resolved on the following among others: THAT\n\ni. Nigeria must return to Federal Constitution Convenance as we had in the 1960 and 1963 Constitutions to save Nigeria from imminent but avoidable consequential balkanization and conflagration.\n\nii. Ethnic Nationalities who have been sidelined, discriminated against and treated as inferior citizens and whose legitimate agitations and campaign for restoration to federalism which was endorsed by NADECO will be more fortified to achieve their Self Determination pursuit as enshrined under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as well as the African Charter of Peoples Right adopted in 1998/1999 in Adisa Ababa.\n\niii. NADECO will intensify its credible, responsible and patriotic campaign through all legal and legitimate actions to ensure that the current unsustainable and unacceptable national structure which is warped, skewed and lopsided and had given undue and dubious advantage to a section of the country is restructured so that Nigeria can have a balanced, just and equitable economic and political pace for an all-inclusive society.\n\niv. NADECO will redouble its efforts at making the current political operators of the Nigerian State to stop their disgraceful and insensitive policies that continue to promote sectional interests of the current rulers to the detriment of all other ethnic nationalities when Nigeria is supposed to be an inheritance and joint project of all citizens.\n\nv. NADECO will continue to support legitimate and legal agitations and campaign for self-determination by Ethnic Nationalities, Civil Societies and Credible opinion moulders because the current government policies through its centralized and unitarised governance had resulted to evidentially unjust, unfair, inequitable and discriminatory, policies on ethnic, religious, gender and other statuses in society. We will continue to resist the provocative violations of section 14(3) of the false document called 1999 Constitution brought into existence by Decree 29, of 1999 which provides that:\n\n\u201cThe composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or in any of its agencies\u201d.\n\nTo Her Excellency, Mrs. Gladys Kanu, the widow of Admiral Godwin Kanu, the children, family members, friends and colleagues, we are not mourning Admiral Kanu but celebrating a life excellently lived in service to God and humanity. You have a duty to keep clean the untainted and credible legacy, Admiral Kanu has left for you. Admiral Kanu\u2019s honesty and transparency in life was anchored on the inspirational exhortation contained in 1Timothy 6:6-7 which says: 6\u201cGodliness and contentment is great gain\u201d 7\u201cfor we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world\u201d.\n\nIn accordance with this scriptural admonition, Admiral Kanu fitted into the following immortal sayings:\n\nJohn Morley, list viscount Morley of Blackburn, 1838-1923, English politician says: \u201cThe great business of life is to be, to do, to do without, and to depart\u201d\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807-82, American Poet in (Ballads and other poeus: The Rainy Day 1842) says: \u201cInto each life some rain must fall. Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul. Our ingress into the world was naked and bare Our progress through the world is trouble and care\u201d\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807-82, American Poet in A Psalm of Life, 1839 and the Ladder of Saint Augustine) says again: \u201cLives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sand of time. The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, But they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night\u201d AND\n\nAbraham Lincoln, 1809-65, 16th President of the United States declares \u201cLet us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty\u201d (Address 1860).\n\nAdmiral Kanu has transited to the second address after an eventful and productive life.

          "title": "Cornered by African Youth, Macron Intends to Repair FrancAfrique",
          "text": "Cheikh Fall did not hold back last week when he saw French President Emmanuel Macron during a plenary session of a France-Africa conference.\n\n\u201cI asked Macron to seek forgiveness from Africans, stop empowering African dictators and stop the pseudo paternalistic cooperation,\u201d the Senegalese social entrepreneur told Al Jazeera, recalling the exchange.\n\nFall was one of several young Africans who peppered Macron with unfiltered criticism of France during Friday\u2019s event, seen as part of the French president\u2019s attempt to reshape his country\u2019s relations with former colonies on the continent.\n\nIn a bid to leave the infamous legacy of FrancAfrique \u2013 a decade-old shadowy network of French politicians and African elites aiming to maintain French domination in post-colonial Africa \u2013 behind, Macron invited hundreds of young businesspeople, artists and researchers to the meeting in Montpellier \u2013 but no African heads of state or government leaders.\n\nSince coming to power in 2017, 43-year-old Macron has presented himself as the standard-bearer of a new generation that aims to start a new chapter between Paris and its former colonies after a long and disturbing history that haunts contemporary France to this day.\n\nBut specific instances from that troubled past apparently caught him off guard on the stage as he awkwardly listened to young Africans who assailed Paris\u2019s \u201carrogance\u201d and \u201cpaternalism\u201d in its asymmetric relations with African countries and urged him to offer an apology for colonial-era crimes.\n\nCornered by candid criticism, Macron promised an honest assessment of the colonial past. \u201cWe must recognise this responsibility and bear it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our past and of the relationship.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the conference took place as Macron aims to divert the focus of ties from the colonial past, with France finding itself in a fierce competition of power with growing Chinese, Russian and Turkish involvement in its \u201cbackyard\u201d.\n\nIn this sense, the French president has taken a number of steps including commissioning a report that found that Paris bears \u201coverwhelming responsibilities\u2019\u2019 over the Rwandan genocide and was \u201cblind\u201d to preparations for the 1994 massacres in which about 800,000 people were killed.\n\nHowever, as much as the report marked a rare confession by the French state, it also cleared Paris of complicity in the genocide and carefully placed blame on the then-President Francois Mitterrand instead of the French state itself.\n\nSeparately, Macron embraced another state report on colonial rule in Algeria that recommended the establishment of a \u201cmemories and truth\u201d commission but ruled out an official apology for the crimes committed.\n\nMacron has also agreed to return some of the artefacts stolen from African countries during colonisation; to declassify secret files on the assassination of anti-imperialist Burkina Faso leader Thomas Sankara; and to reform, not end, the CFA franc, a French-backed currency used by former French colonies in West Africa that is seen by many as a symbol of neo-colonialism.\n\nNathaniel Powell, an analyst at Oxford Analytica, said such steps were symbolic and not structural gestures.\n\n\u201cThey are illustrative of Macron\u2019s longer-term soft-power aspirations of overcoming anti-French sentiment while maintaining the centrality of France as a privileged African partner,\u201d Powell told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said there was a clash between these aspirations and the security interests of the French state.\n\n\u201cNone of the steps can alter the \u2018hard\u2019 aspects of the relationship \u2013 support for autocracies, ambivalence about democratic aspirations, a mindset hyper-focused on security interests and a kind of autocratic political stability that benefits those interests. As long as those remain the pillars of France\u2019s African policy, then nothing else matters very much,\u201d Powell said.\n\nIn fact, many former French presidents, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, have attempted to reshape France\u2019s engagement in Africa but ended up leading the military operations on the continent.\n\nProfessor Bruno Charbonneau, at Canada\u2019s Royal Military College Saint-Jean, said this was not a coincidence as he highlighted the historical legacies that define the ties between France and a number of African countries.\n\n\u201cThree structural factors always come into play: One, the French military has an institutional interest in sustaining French military engagement in Africa, or at least sustaining the capacity to intervene; and it also has much influence into the policymaking process and decision-making when it comes to Francophone Africa,\u201d Charbonneau told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cSecond, whatever the context or situation, Francophone African elites expect France to intervene and be part of the discussion, knowing that they can fall back on Paris for help,\u201d he said. \u201cLastly, at the UN Security Council, France is recognised to be the penholder and diplomatic leader for all things related to Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nStill, France has found itself increasingly at loggerheads with a number of its former colonies, facing waves of rising discontentment.\n\nEarlier this month, Macron triggered a fresh crisis with Algeria when, according to the French daily Le Monde, he said the former French colony was ruled by a \u201cpolitical-military system\u201d and that its official history has been \u201ctotally re-written\u201d based on \u201ca discourse of hatred towards France\u201d.\n\nThe Algerian presidency swiftly hit back at Macron\u2019s \u201cinsulting\u201d remarks, while Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra said France needs to \u201cdecolonise\u201d its history and free itself of certain attitudes which are linked to an ideology that normalised \u201cthe crime against humanity which was the colonisation of Algeria, Mali and the colonisation of so many African people\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mali, the reports of possible deployment of mercenaries hired by the controversial Wagner Group in the country has added another layer to already tense ties between Paris and the soldiers behind two military coups since August 2020.\n\nFrance, which has deployed more than 5,000 soldiers across the Sahel region, strongly opposes such a move, worrying the mercenaries would undermine the France-led military operations against armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda.\n\nOn the other hand, Malian leaders present the possible deployment as \u201cPlan B\u201d in the fight against the armed groups, accusing France of \u201cabandoning\u201d Mali following its decision to reduce its troops by about half and close down military bases.\n\nThe rising tensions have also come at a time when anti-French sentiment has become widely popular among Malians who accuse Paris of failing to contain the escalating violence and pursuing a hidden agenda.\n\nMacron\u2019s approach to military takeovers in Mali and Chad has also led many to question France\u2019s priorities in the region. While the French president firmly rejected the two coups in Mali and urged for democratic governance, he quickly endorsed the military power grab in Chad after the death of President Idriss Deby, a vital figure in France\u2019s security apparatus in the region for decades.\n\nFor Ndongo Samba Sylla, a Senegalese development economist, last week\u2019s conference was just a rebranding of France\u2019s neocolonial engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Francafrique is out of breath and it needs a new look. France is inventing its African civil society and co-opting its own African intellectuals in order to give the illusion of change,\u201d Sylla told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWhat credibility can be given to this rebranding exercise when Macron himself doesn\u2019t hesitate to chew up French civil society and to destroy democratic expression in Francophone Africa by endorsing military coups and dynastic successions,\u201d he asked.\n\nNonetheless, Fall is hopeful the event will help forge healthier relations between France and African countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to breathe new life into the relationship. I want the summit to be a new platform to redefine the relations,\u201d Fall said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to define the possible futures of FrancAfrique.\u201d",

We need to first be strong. The military threats our country is facing is different from what we saw 10, five or three years ago,\u201d he said, adding that tensions on the Korean peninsula will not be easily resolved \u201cdue to the US\u201d.\n\nYang Uk, an expert in military strategic studies at Hannam University in Seoul, told Al Jazeera that Kim\u2019s message on alleged US \u201chostility\u201d was nothing if not \u201cconstant\u201d.\n\nKim made the remarks standing in front of a variety of weapons, including a Hwasong-16 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), photos in the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun showed.\n\nThe Hwasong-16 is North Korea\u2019s largest ICBM and was unveiled at a military parade in October 2020, but not yet test fired.\n\n\u201cWe are not discussing war with anyone, but rather to prevent war itself and to literally increase war deterrence for the protection of national sovereignty,\u201d he added.\n\nThe two Koreas have been in an accelerating arms race, with both sides testing increasingly advanced short-range ballistic missiles and other hardware.\n\nSouth Korea recently test fired its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, and plans to build major new weapons include aircraft carriers. It has also bought American-made F-35 stealth fighters.\n\nNorth Korea has pushed ahead with its missile programme, and analysts say it has begun a major expansion of its main nuclear reactor, used to produce fuel for nuclear bombs.\n\nThe United States has said it is willing to hold diplomatic talks at any time with North Korea, Pyongyang has said it is not interested as long as Washington maintains policies such as sanctions and military activities in South Korea.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 assertion that it holds no hostile feelings towards North Korea are hard to believe in the face of its continued \u201cwrong judgements and actions,\u201d Kim said, without elaborating.\n\nLast week, Pyongyang and Seoul reconnected their cross-border hotline in a sign of thawing ties, with only a few months left in office for the South\u2019s pro-engagement President Moon Jae-in.\n\nBut Kim accused Seoul of \u201creckless ambition\u201d and a \u201ctwo-faced, illogical\u201d attitude.\n\nTheir \u201cunrestricted and dangerous attempts to strengthen military power are destroying the military balance on the Korean peninsula and increasing military instability and danger,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cUnder the absurd pretext of suppressing our threats, South Korea has openly expressed its desire to gain an edge over us in military power on various occasions.\u201d",
