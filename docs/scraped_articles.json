          "text": "\u2026opens up on ties to Ibori, Uduaghan, Yar \u2018Adua\u201d\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u2018I fought for Derivation, introduced Amnesty Program\u2019\n\nBy Kennedy Mbele\n\nChief David Edevbie belongs to that breed called technocrats. The University of Lagos economics graduate sojourned abroad to earn higher degrees at Cardiff and Harvard business schools. Edevbie also had the privilege of working for global development agencies, notably the Commonwealth Development Commission (CDC).\n\nFor much of the 1990s, he contributed immensely to the economic success recorded in Asia and the Pacific region. He has had to be called upon to intervene in the economic development of Delta State and other nations at critical moments. Edevbie was Delta State Commissioner for Finance three times (1999-2003, 2003-2005 and 2015-2019) and Chief of Staff to the Governor (2019-2021). Nationally, he was the Director of Finance and Administration of the Yar\u2019Adua Campaign Organization in 2006 and 2007. Later, he was Principal Secretary to President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua. In this interview, Edevbie speaks on why he may be the one to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State. Excerpts:\n\nWhat is your assessment of the development and growth of Delta State in the current democratic dispensation since1999?\n\nREAD ALSO:Delta 2023: APC can\u2019t defeat PDP because of Okowa\u2019s achievements \u2013 Ossai\n\nThere has been a lot of development in Delta State starting from the situation we inherited from 1999. Let\u2019s take it from each governor. Before Chief James Onanefe Ibori, it was like the state was on ground zero. We need to go back a little bit in history. The state was formed in 1991 and, between 1991 and 1999, it was under military regime. Little or nothing was done because we had just been created as a state. There was very little infrastructure, there was very little public structure in place. Chief Ibori recognized that and we started to lay the basic foundations. We looked at the state and put a development plan in place. One thing was clear, over 50% of the state is riverine and they were disconnected from the upland effectively. The first thing he did in terms of laying infrastructure was to try and connect them to the mainland. That\u2019s what gave rise to the Omadina Bridge, the Bomadi Bridge over Forcados River and the Aboh Bridge over Ase River. Those were the first significant steps taken in order to connect the riverine area to the mainland. Then, obviously there was focus on rural electricity and on roads. His Excellency, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan came in and built upon that. He did all the usual things one would expect as government and he also had the foresight to recognize that we needed to start looking at Delta beyond oil. He started with some major infrastructure. The Asaba Airport started under him. The current governor has built upon that and he has done so well in terms of infrastructure; he is called Roadmaster. I have to say that in all these cases, I have been involved in one form or the other and I think there is still a lot more work to be done. Asaba, the capital territory, needs further work in order to bring it up to the standard we have seen in other parts of the country. You also know that Delta is not a one-city state; we have several cities and those cities need to be developed in order to reduce the urban migration that is going on.\n\nHow will you assess your personal contributions in government through your services as several times Commissioner of Finance and more recently Chief of Staff to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa?\n\nTo be honest with you, the assessment has to be done by my superiors. There is self-assessment and there is assessment done by my bosses. But, if you look at my trajectory, I am the longest serving Commissioner of Finance that has been in the country so far. I don\u2019t think Chief Ibori would have appointed me Commissioner twice, I don\u2019t think the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria would have appointed me his Principal Secretary to take over from his outgoing Chief of Staff, I don\u2019t think I would have come back to Delta State and be appointed again as Commissioner for Finance for the third time and subsequently Chief of Staff if I wasn\u2019t doing something right. I think I have done pretty well in the public space if you look at a number of things that I have done, starting from my first appointment as Commissioner for Finance. We were the first state in the country to publish our audited accounts, we were the first state in the country to pay minimum wage of N7,500 in 2000, we were the first state to introduce the Cash Budget System, we were the first to introduce Computerised Management System in terms of SAP and we were first in so many other things. So, I think in general, I have done pretty well and that\u2019s it within the state. There are also things I have done at the federal level. I fought for the 13% Derivation which was given to us and so many other things. I am sure that you have seen what is happening with Amnesty (Program). That again is one of the things that were introduced by me. I have done pretty well and there is still a lot more to do.\n\nYou are a frontline aspirant of the PDP for the 2023 governorship ticket in Delta State. What inspired you to step out to want to govern the state?\n\nI haven\u2019t actually taken the step, what I am doing is consulting. I am consulting widely. Quite frankly, what is happening is more of the public. A lot of people from the public want me to run and I am seriously considering it. Why would I consider it? I think it is self-explanatory. I have served or worked with three governors. I have been involved in all their plans and successes at one stage or another and funded most of them. So, I have a deep understanding of the challenges that face the state and I clearly have the educational background, I clearly have the experience. I think I am second to none in any of those fields. We are at a stage in this country where we need someone who has the experience, who has the knowledge, because the country at this stage is facing enormous financial challenges and if we don\u2019t get it right, I don\u2019t know where we will end up. And here you have someone who already has the experience, who already has the knowledge and who has the financial expertise, because, at the end of the day, government is about the management of resources and I am an expert in managing resources.\n\nWhat then is your vision for the development of the state in terms of the economy and infrastructure?\n\nMy vision is shaped by the problems that exist. Epileptic power supply, high unemployment, insecurity, the list goes on and on. We have done well till date but we need somebody who knows the history of how we achieved what we have achieved today and can immediately hit the ground running in taking us to the next level. That is where my vision comes in. My vision is very simple: Modernization of Delta State. We need to go from a system we inherited from the colonial masters into a more modern system, a current system which is based on value addition, industrialisation, knowledge-based economy and it is based on a number of key drivers. The first is energy. In my opinion, if we don\u2019t sort out our energy problem, everything else we are doing is going to be a waste of time. You need to get your power sorted because that is the driver of everything. I intend to build a 500 megawatts power plant as soon as I can. It can be done within three years. I have done it across the world and I have even done it in Delta. We have an 8.5 megawatts power plant in Asaba already. I was the chairman of the committee. So, it is not like it can\u2019t be done. It is just that it will be done on a much larger scale. The power generated will meet all our needs and the surplus will be sold to the energy grid of BEDC. Most people don\u2019t know that we already own about 15% of the equity in BEDC. (Deltans) are a part owner of BEDC. I have had discussions with them and it will be seamless. The next thing is security. Without security, I am afraid, no investor will want to come into your state, whether domestic or foreign. On the two approaches in addressing the security problem, His Excellency, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa has already laid the foundation and I just want to build upon that and focus more on how I can relate with the Federal Government. The second step of it is funding. Again, His Excellency, Governor Okowa has done a great deal in that field and I am just looking to upgrade that. That\u2019s why you have the Security Trust Fund that provides the funding of the security architecture that we have place. I need far more funding working with the private sector. Once we have that in place and we sort out the energy problem, I can\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t deploy modern technology in helping to combat crime. Things like CCTV, drones, they don\u2019t cost that much any longer. Those are things that we can deploy in flashpoints to help us with our security challenges. The other area I think we need to address is law. We need to take a look at our laws, revive those laws to give them more teeth, more bite. The long-term measure is industrialization. Once we have industrialization in place, I believe it will mop up unemployment which is part of the problem of security that we have, especially among the youth. The next driver is job security. We need to focus on job and wealth creation. That covers a lot of gamut of areas but I will start with an excellent Chief Job Creation Office. That exists already. I was part of the process and they are doing an excellent job. That\u2019s where things like graduate employment development schemes, GEEP, YAGEP, etcetera come from. I will like to continue with that and, if possible, increase the scope. The next is micro credit schemes. I am an economist. Everybody knows that the private sector is the engine of economic growth and within the private sector are small businesses that actually drive employment. So, I will like to stand a lot more in that area, to provide credit for small and medium scale enterprises. There are other areas like agriculture. That is part of wealth and job creation but my emphasis would be to try and bring in the private sector, not to try and do it as government because government has no business being in business, certainly not in agriculture. There are lot of opportunities there. By some estimates, we could be generating about $10b worth of agricultural produce, if we do the right thing in terms of large scale mixed with small scale holders. There is also the creative industry. We have got the Film Village there. That is another area we could take a look at. I have spoken to the likes of Netflix who would be interested. You know His Excellency is building a Film Village, it will soon be finished. That will provide an avenue for creativity and job creation because in the process of making films, working with the likes of Netflix, we could be increasing revenue generation. There are lots of other areas in job and wealth creation but that is just a summary of it. The next area would be social infrastructure. We all know about roads and other infrastructures that are required in the state but I don\u2019t look at it from the perspective of roads. The last three governors have done so well, particularly the current governor when it comes to roads and infrastructure. It is work in progress. More infrastructure is required but I want to take a different perspective. I want to look at it from an inter-modal transportation system to put in place a transportation plan. Once you have a transportation master plan, it doesn\u2019t just limit you to roads. It could be roads, bridges, railway, airport etcetera and, very importantly, the riverine areas. Once you connect all together, you then have an integrated transportation system. That is part of the development of social infrastructure.\n\nThere are other things like education, for example. We all know what needs to be done there but my perspective for education is to tie education with the private sector. It doesn\u2019t make sense to continue to produce graduates when there are no jobs for the graduates to go into. There must be more discussions between the private sector, industry and the university so that universities are producing the graduates that fit into the private sector and the industries. That is the perspective that I would like to take when it comes to social infrastructure. There are some specific things I would like to see done. Continue with free education, there is no doubt about that. At the university level we must continue with bursaries but, in addition, I believe student loan should be provided to those who require it. That is a commitment that I am making, that if I become governor, I would provide student loan to those who require it. On health, I want to look at it from the point of view of, how do we improve our life expectancy? At the moment it is about 54, I believe. I would like to increase life expectancy from 54 to 70. That can be done in eight years. I have looked at studies and everything that is required to facilitate that can be done. All of these are in my manifesto. The last one is public sector reforms. In order to achieve all the things that I am talking about, there must be reforms in the public sector. We can\u2019t carry on the way we are doing. We must have a public sector that is able to deliver on all the requests we have in mind. So, within the first 100 days, I would like a situation whereby we do a best value review of the public sector and to change the public sector, not very much, but so that it becomes more dynamic, more based on IT in order to produce better services for the people.\n\nAgain, in terms of public sector reforms, looking at the executive, I think we need to have a governance system that is reflective of the people being governed. I do not think it is right to have a population where over 50% is women but when it comes to governance you have a token or handful of women. That is not right. If you really want to have a system that works, you have to have a governance that reflects the people being governed. That is why I am committed to saying that at least 35% of all political appointments will be given to women.\n\nThe same applies to youth. You may not be aware that we are one of the youngest populations in the world. If you look at our population demographics, over 70 % of our population is under 35 years old. What that tells you is, and I think we all saw it during EndSARS, we (older people) are in a minority. We have to have a governance structure that reflects them. So, again, I have already committed to reserve 25% of all political appointments for youths. There is a reason for doing that. I was brought into government as a youth and that\u2019s why I can sit here and boast of all the experiences that I have. That is because somebody saw it fit to think ahead and do so. I am one of very few in Delta. I would like to see a situation that when it comes to governorship, there are 3, 4, 5, 6 credible people with the knowledge and experience that people would expect so that the people can have genuine choice. The next thing I would like to see in terms of public sector reforms is, I think it is wrong for people to work for 35 years of their lives and not get paid their pension. People die while waiting for their pension. The first thing I would like to do is to look at the Contributory Pension Scheme. I think as at when I left government, it was about N70b owed by local governments which owe the majority and some by the state government. What I undertake to do when I become governor is to pay the whole amount within one year, so that we have a situation that when people work and retire, they get what is due to them.\n\nNow, all of these we must package in a development plan and passed by the House of Assembly so that it becomes a law and everybody then knows what the development plan of Delta State is for the next 20 years. What people don\u2019t realise is that we had a development plan before Lagos State but Lagos has continued to follow their plan. We need to put that plan in place and it has to be approved so that everybody has an understanding of where we are coming from and where we are going. You can\u2019t embark on a journey without knowing where you are going.\n\nHaving been around and been part of the process of development in Delta State, what is the need of each of the senatorial districts?\n\nI think all senatorial districts want development. They want roads, they want schools, they want all. There is no senatorial district that has everything. They all want the same thing. I think what you are referring to is the peculiar needs of the areas and that is a reflection of the different terrains.\n\nLet\u2019s start from Delta South. It is largely riverine and the major problem we have there is the oil production that goes on in majority of the place. Everything that has to do with oil production is a problem. Then, certainly, because it is riverine, it costs a lot more money to develop but, like I said, if we have a development plan like we had in 1999 and if we had followed, I think by now we would have done a lot more in the riverine area. If you really want a state where everybody has and feels an equal part of, we must spend more emphasis on the riverine areas.\n\nThe other thing I would like to pursue is the Warri Port. The people of Warri and around that area are concerned that that port continues to operate sub-optimally. If it operates optimally, the multiplier effect would be significant. If you look at the Ijaw area, everything to do with development is required in that area, without a doubt. And that is because it is a difficult terrain but if we spend the money we need to spend, within 20 years, and especially if you are working with the private sector, there is no reason why we can\u2019t have it looking much better than it is today, more like a Dubai, more like an Miami. But in term of specifics, I have been going around consulting and one of the things that they keep raising, constantly, is the need for a higher institution in the Ijaw area. There isn\u2019t. So, I think we would need to look at the finances of the state at the time whether it does justify another higher institution. But in the short term, what we could do is to look at existing institutions. The School of Marine Technology in Burutu, if we spend more money there, I think that will bring some succour in that area, especially in respect to higher institutions. The same applies to the College of Engineering in Oleh, the Oleh Campus of the Delta State University. I think if we spend more money there and upgrade it, that would satisfy a lot of people with respect to higher education. In Delta Central where I am from, I am old enough to know that it was once the industrial hub of Delta State. There were so many businesses which then created employment but they are all gone. So, I think there needs to be focus on industrialization. But before we can move forward with the industrialisation, we must address the energy issue like I said. We will first address it in the Oghara, Jesse, Sapele axis and then come down to the Ughelli, Udu axis. Once we address the power situation, we address the security situation, government would be able to attract the private sector into industries in those areas. If necessary, government can take equity in order to bring in those industries to that area to create jobs. And then we have Abraka. It is already there. It can be a developmental hub for us in Delta Central. We already have people there, what we can do is to have a way of bringing in industries that can take the feed from the university into them in order to have a synergy between industry and the university. Then Delta North. It has riverine areas and upland. The riverine areas have the same problems as the riverine areas elsewhere and, in the upland, we have erosion. Erosion is a major issue in Delta North and it needs to be tackled and addressed. There is also the issue of industry. Luckily Delta North is peaceful, so I see it as quite easy to attract businesses. I would start by breathing life into the Kwale Industrial Park. I will start by breathing life into the Asaba Industrial Park. You know there is an Industrial Park in Asaba but it hasn\u2019t been functional. I would like to bring it up. Because of its proximity to the airport that is a very quick win. There are several other Industrial Parks that have been created by His Excellency that I would like to continue to pursue. The final thing in Delta North of course is Asaba. We need a master plan for Asaba. We need to develop Asaba. I don\u2019t see any reason why we cannot have an inner rail network. In the local governments, if we have ICT backbone in all the 25 local government areas, that will provide a platform for developing ICT across the state. That is an area I am much interested in, knowledge-based economy. Whether you like it or you don\u2019t, it is already happening, anyway. Why not formalise what already exists and channel the knowledge and expertise of these young men into profitable businesses. It just requires government to provide the enabling environment that will allow it to happen.\n\nBut how would you manage the sentiments arising from the diverse ethnic groups to be able to achieve these visions?\n\nFirst of all, we shouldn\u2019t look at the fact that we have multi-ethnic groups as a disadvantage. I see it as an advantage. The truth of the matter is that, yes, we are multi-ethnic but there is a lot of inter-marriage among us. We are one people and we need to start seeing ourselves more as one people. We need to stop doing things that promote ethnic sentiments as opposed to the sentiment of Deltans and I think the younger generation tend to focus more towards that. They don\u2019t really care where you are from. All they want is that they want jobs, they want education, they want good health. So, I don\u2019t see that as a major challenge. Luckily, the three governors before me have instituted peace. We now have peace in our society generally. Like I mentioned before, if we have a development plan that is put on the table, debated and discussed by all ethnic groups and it is clear what the development plan is for the next 20 years, everybody then knows where they fit in within the system, and as long as revenue comes in as I anticipate the revenue coming in, and everyone is treated fairly, I don\u2019t see that being a problem. When it comes to ethnicity, I think most of the time when we do have a problem, it is promoted by people who have ethnic mindset. They are the ones that create problem. I think the average Deltan doesn\u2019t really care where you come from. Certainly, the younger ones don\u2019t really care. All they want is good services as a people.\n\nBesides industrialization, we have rich deposit of oil, gas and other mineral resources. What is your plan towards harnessing these for economic value?\n\nFirst of all, you must understand that the gas resources we have here do not belong to Delta State. Let\u2019s be very clear on that. We are like oil bearing, we are like gas bearing but it belongs to the Federal Government. Having said that, other minerals that we have in Delta State are things that we can attract people to come and take advantage of. If necessary, the state government can do feasibility and take equity in companies that are interested to act as a catalyst for the development of all of it. We have to do it. If we are going to have a situation where the private sector becomes the engine room of our economic growth, we just have to do it. The other thing we need to do obviously is create an enabling environment but in order to create an enabling environment, you have to sort out your power supply, you have to sort out your security. Those are very basic. You have to sort out your infrastructure. Once these things are in place, I have worked in the private sector, what they are interested in is making returns, making revenue and once everything is in place that enables them to do that, trust me, they will come.\n\nBack on security, what are your thoughts on the present architecture? Is the conventional police enough? If not, what else do we need to do?\n\nWhat we require is a security system that is more local, more locally controlled. Yes, we will relate with the Federal Government but we will need the security architecture itself to be under our control and that covers from the standard police to the vigilante groups. All of those are part of the security architecture that needs to be put in place. That combined with adequate funding, because that is the major drawback all the time when it comes to security. You can\u2019t have a situation where policemen are fueling their own cars. You can\u2019t have a situation where policemen are buying their own bullets. Then you are not being serious. You also have to introduce information technology. All of these things that I have mentioned are actually being done by this government of which I was a part of. That is why security infrastructure is being provided, the Trust Fund and all of that. All I have to do is to ramp it up, put more money, lay more emphasis on attracting more people from the private sector. We also have to get our communities involved because if we don\u2019t do that, we will continue to have the problems we have. But I think it is the desire of everyone in the community to have better security, so we will get the support if we put the right architecture in place.\n\nBut if you become governor, will you be accessible?\n\nI will be accessible but you must understand accessible to enable me do the job that I am appointed to do. Of course, you have to be accessible otherwise you will lose touch with the people you are supposed to be governing. There are many forms of interaction these days. Again, it has been modernized. There is the physical meeting but there is less emphasis on physical meeting now. Covid has made it clear, you don\u2019t need to sit in front of each other every day to get things done. There is the telephone, there are computers, there are Zoom meetings, then you also have social media, Facebook etcetera. That is where the world is moving to in terms of interaction and that is the sort of interaction I would like to promote. But what matters the most is putting in place a system that allows the common man to have access to the people that are governing him. It is very important because if you don\u2019t do that, how will I be held accountable by the people if they are not accessible to me? And how will I know whether I am doing the right thing if they are not accessible to me? Accessibility is the number one issue that must be, so I will be extremely accessible so that we continue to have continuous dialogue. There has to be continuous dialogue between the people that are governing and the people that are being governed because at the end of the day it is for the people by the people. Therefore, accessibility is key.\n\nHow would you harness our aquatic bodies to add value to the state economy?\n\nI think it is an opportunity for us. There is so much happening in the riverine areas. There is no reason that we cannot be involved in fisheries, heavily involved in fisheries and anything that involves the riverine areas. It is just a matter of putting in place a master plan that captures all the potentials that exist and then investing in all those potentials.\n\nI see a river as another form of road. As far as I am concerned, you need to get on a boat and it is the same thing as being in a car. We need to move our mindset towards that. Some of the most beautiful cities in the world are in the riverine areas. The potentials are enormous in the riverine areas. All we have to do is to find a way of connecting them equally. Like I said, sometimes, it is even more efficient to move cargo by river than by road. It may be far more efficient but first of all, you have to bring them in to make them feel and see that they are an equal partner in this our state called Delta.\n\nWhat is your definition of Delta Beyond Oil\n\nDelta Beyond Oil is very simple, as the name says. Whether you like it or not, and this is a fact, by 2030, a lot of countries are going to start reducing the amount of oil that they import. Some have set deadlines in terms of introducing electric cars, so the prognosis for oil is actually quite bad if you look at it. Therefore, we must find a way, because it is going to affect the whole country and, certainly, it will affect us. We must move to start to invest in other areas outside oil. That is why my emphasis is on industrialization, on knowledge-based economy, because even the largest producers of oil right now are moving that way. Places like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, it is clear what they are doing. They are using the money from the oil and investing in other areas. That is what we need to do so that by the time oil and gas and all those things decline, we would have moved into a different trajectory and definitely Delta will then be beyond oil.\n\nFinally, what is your message to Deltans?\n\nMy message to Deltans is very clear. 2023 is a pivotal point. We are all in this country, perhaps this is what I meant by the development of democracy, and it comes from history and experience. I think perhaps a lot of people didn\u2019t think that experience matters. A lot of people didn\u2019t think that educational qualifications matter. But I have just told you, governance is about the management of resources and the people who can manage these resources are the people who have knowledge and experience in such area. We have seen that in the last six years, I don\u2019t want to go into the politics of it, but we have seen the consequences of it. So, we need to make sure that in Delta State, we don\u2019t fall into that trap because if we fall into that trap, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t know how we can extricate ourselves.\n\n\u00b7",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it has given concrete expression to the Federal Government\u2019s drive to promote indigenous innovative technologies in Nigeria\u2019s telecommunication sector.\n\nThe Commission said it has demonstrated this by organising the maiden prototype and research exposition aimed at showcasing no fewer than 10 prototypes, arising from its sponsored Telecommunications-Based Research Innovation Projects in the Nigerian universities.\n\nAt the event, which took place at the Commission\u2019s Communications and Digital Economy Complex, Head Office Annex in Mbora District, Abuja, from 21\u201322, February 2022, the Commission selected 10 prototypes for exhibition as outputs of its telecom research project during the two-day event.\n\nThe top 10 prototypes include: Multiple operators\u2019 enabled SIM, GSM communication-based walking cane robot, Powerline communications module, Home-grown electrical power charger, Low-cost GSM telephone system, Wireless power transfer device, Vital sign monitor, Plastic optical fibre cable, Wearable E-band tracker, and a Software-based nomadic base station.\n\nThe Commission said it is implementing the research and prototype exposition as a way of encouraging the commercializing of the prototypes, as an influential platform for universities, professionals and industry experts to come together, share information and build long-lasting business relationships.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, stated that, through the NCC\u2019s telecoms-based research and prototype exposition, \u201cthe indigenous technological capabilities of Nigerians will be fully appreciated, harnessed, and utilised towards stimulating the overall productivity and sustainability of the telecommunications industry.\u201d\n\nPantami emphasised that research is considered a necessary condition for the technological development of any nation and is also regarded as the backbone of the communications industry because it is the building block for the future development of advanced telecommunications products and services. He tasked the mobile network operators (MNOs) to work with NCC to support indigenous technology development to solve national challenges in future.\n\nThe Minister commended the Commission\u2019s Board and Management for facilitating the delivery of the lofty policy targets contained in the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content (NPPIC) 2021. He also thanked the recipients of the Commission\u2019s grants for the display of already developed prototypes for the knowledge of the industry stakeholders.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Chairman, NCC, Board of Commissioners, Prof. Adeolu Akande, declared that the Commission will continue to provide the enabling environment to bridge the gap in the significant tripartite relationship among the academia, industry, and the government. He encouraged participants to support NCC\u2019s initiative to succeed, as businesses will emerge, and sustainable jobs will be available for our young graduates on account of these new developments.\n\nAlso in his address, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, reinforced the Commission\u2019s commitment to discharging its role as an active regulator to drive the indigenous content development component of the nation\u2019s telecoms sector. The EVC reiterated the significance of building the indigenous technological capacities of Nigerians through partnerships with relevant stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has awarded grants to successful academic institutions to develop Working Prototype and Telecommunications-led Products capable of addressing industry needs and providing overall sustainability, fully-developed and ready-for-the-first phase of market entry\u201d, Danbatta stated.\n\nThe EVC asserted that \u201cit is important to have a commercialisation strategy to transit from rudimentary research into the market to address the local challenges and reduce the over-dependence on imported innovations and technologies with the attendant drain on the nation scarce foreign exchange. This is what this programme hopes to achieve to maximize the full potential of academia in contributing to the steady growth of the telecoms industry in Nigeria\u201d.",

I have never supported that project.\n\n\u201cWho tells you that an Igboman will be allowed to test that seat? But if by accident an Igboman is made President, he will not last on the seat. So it has been revealed to me.\u201d\n\nThe Bishop said his spirit had continually remained pained each time sit-at-home order was declared in the South East.\n\nHe said the best thing the Federal Government should do if there was no intention to exterminate the Igbo through the sit-at-home exercise, is to release Kanu or send him to a correctional centre.\n\n\u201cFederal Government should release Nnamdi Kanu from the Directorate of the State Service (DSS) detention unconditionally, or send him to a correctional center to avoid this every Monday sit-at-home order.\n\n\u201cFederal Government is not considering the plight of the poor masses in the South East. Everyone knows that there are people, and they are in large numbers, who cannot feed themselves or their families, if they do not go out on a daily basis to labour.\n\n\u201cWhat do they expect this class of people to be doing, to die of hunger with their families?\n\n\u201cPeople are being killed every week and property worth millions of naira destroyed every week for non-compliance to the order.\n\n\u201cThe blood of the innocent Igbo are crying every day. If you come out to look for your daily bread, your life will be in danger because of sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cI call on the Federal Ministry of Justice to do the needful to save this ugly situation. The economy of the Igbo has nose-dived. Our businesses are paralyzed and many people in Igboland are dying of hunger.\n\n\u201cNothing is working again in the South East. The people of South East are made to suffer extraordinary hardship whereas Ndigbo are known for enterprenuership, \u201d the Cleric said.\n\nUdeh, who is the General Overseer of Mount Zion Faith Global Liberation Ministry, added that FG should not pretend not to know that Ndigbo had been suffering because of the series of sit-at-home orders.",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has warned the public of a newly-hatched malicious software that steals users\u2019 banking app login credentials on Android devices.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by NCC spokesperson Dr Ikechukwu Adinde at the weekend, the malware which was discovered by the Commission\u2019s Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), is called \u201cXenomorph\u201d,\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nNCC said Xenomorph has been found to target 56 financial institutions from Europe, has high impact and high vulnerability rate, with a major intent to steal credentials, combined with the use of SMS and Notification interception to log in and use potential 2-factor authentication tokens.\n\nThe Commission explained that Xenomorph is propagated by an application that was slipped into the Google Play store and masquerading as a legitimate application called \u201cFast Cleaner\u201d which is supposedly meant to clear junk, increase device speed and optimize battery. In reality, however, the app is only a means by which the Xenomorph Trojan could be propagated easily and efficiently.\n\n\u2018To avoid early detection or being denied access to the PlayStore, \u201cFast Cleaner\u201d was disseminated before the malware was placed on the remote server, making it hard for Google to determine that such an app is being used for malicious actions.\n\n\u2018Once up and running on a victim\u2019s device, Xenomorph can harvest device information and Short Messaging Service (SMS), intercept notifications and new SMS messages, perform overlay attacks, and prevent users from uninstalling it. The threat also asks for Accessibility Services privileges, which allow it to grant itself further permissions.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u2018The CSIRT said the malware also steals victims\u2019 banking credentials by overlaying fake login pages on top of legitimate ones. Considering that it can also intercept messages and notifications, it allows its operators to bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication and log into the victims\u2019 accounts without alerting them.\n\n\u2018Xenomorph has been found to target 56 internet banking apps, 28 from Spain, 12 from Italy, 9 from Belgium, and 7 from Portugal, as well as Cryptocurrency wallets and general-purpose applications like emailing services. The Fast Cleaner app has now been removed from the Play Store but not before it garnered 50,000+ downloads,\u201d the CSIRT security advisory asserted,\u2019 NCC said.\n\nIn order not to fall victim to the manipulation, NCC advised telecom consumers to be on alert.\n\nIt further urged telecom consumers and other Internet users, especially those using Android-powered devices to obtain trusted Antivirus solutions and update them regularly to their latest definitions.\n\nConsumers and other stakeholders are also instructed to always update banking applications to their most recent versions.",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nWhile a source pegged the number at 14, another source from the area said they were 16 or more. The police, on their part, said they were yet to ascertain the figure.\n\nThe incident, Sunday Sun gathered, also left scores with varying degrees of gunshot injuries.\n\nSome of the injured persons were rushed to the hospital when the gunmen who were said to have stormed the area with tinted Toyota Corolla car left the scene.\n\nA resident who spoke to Sunday Sun on condition of anonymity narrated that the deceased whose funeral rite was being conducted was killed by suspected cultists last month, on January 30.\n\n\u201cThe guy they were doing his burial today is called Ozo. They killed him in Amansea on 30th January this year. While alive, he was a revenue collector, more of Agboro work. They called him to come and collect money.\n\n\u201cWhen he got to Amansea Junction, he was gunned down. He was their chairman in that Amansea axis.

          "text": "\u2022PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum hail Buhari for signing electoral law\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nFollowing the signing of the new electoral bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday released a new timetable for the 2023 elections, with the conduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them now scheduled for April 4, 2022, to June 3, 2022.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nUnder the new timetable for the 2023 general election, INEC has shifted the presidential and National Assembly elections from February 18 to February 25, 2023, while the governorship elections will hold on March 11, 2023.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said the presidential and National Assembly elections would now hold on February 25 next year instead of the earlier announced date of February 18.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 general election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday, February 25, 2023, while the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday, March 11, 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 general election is now 363 days away,\u201d he explained.\n\nYakubu disclosed that under the law, there are critical time-bound activities from the publication of notice of election to the conduct of polls, which form the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for elections.\n\nAccording to him, some of the critical activities and their dates of implementation are as follows: \u201cPublication of Notice of Election \u2013 Monday, February 28, 2022;\n\n\u201cConduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them \u2013 Monday, April 4, 2022, to Friday, June 3, 2022.\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for Presidential and National Assembly election \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, June 10, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, June 17, 2022;\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, July 1, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, July 15, 2022;\n\n\u201cCommencement of campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections -Wednesday, September 28, 2022; commencement of campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 Wednesday, October 12, 2022; last day of the campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, February 23, 2023; last day of the campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, March 9, 2023,\u201d Yakubu further explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman stated explained that the Notice of Election would be published in INEC offices in all the states of the Federation as required by law on Monday, February 28, 2022.\n\nYakubu said that with the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, the commission would work assiduously to conclude and publish new Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections that are consistent with the Act.\n\n\u201cThese Regulations and Guidelines, as well as Manuals issued by the Commission, are all part of the legal regulatory framework for elections.\n\n\u201cTheir timely publication will enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to become conversant with their provisions as they prepare for the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe INEC chairman, who described the new electoral law as historic said that it was because it was the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 that the Electoral Act was repealed and re-enacted.\n\nHe explained that the 1998 \u2013 1999 elections were administered by transitional decrees until the 2001 Electoral Act was passed into law.\n\nThen, he said, the Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Electoral Act 2002 which was in turn repealed and re-enacted in 2006, 2010 and now we have the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nHe said that in 2017, the commission decided to establish fixed dates for general elections in Nigeria, explaining that the decision was based on INEC\u2019s determination to create certainty in the electoral calendar and to enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to prepare adequately for elections.\n\n\u201cBy that decision, presidential and National Assembly elections shall hold on the third Saturday of February of each general election year, while governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections shall follow two weeks later,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the 2023 general election was initially scheduled to commence on February 18, 2023, with the presidential and National Assembly elections, followed by the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections on March 4, 2023.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that the Commission could not release the detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election, as it normally would, because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nWith the bill now being signed into law, therefore, he said, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), form the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria.\n\nIn particular, he said that the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the general election.\n\n\u201cOne of the significant timelines is the publication of Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election, which has now lapsed,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded stakeholders, especially the political parties, of their responsibility to adhere strictly to the timelines in this Timetable and Schedule of Activities, as well as all other timelines established by the commission.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary that all political parties comply with the extant legal framework, ensure proper organisation and management of party primaries and the nomination of qualified candidates to prevent unnecessary litigations and rancour,\u201d Yakubu told all shareholders.\n\nSpeaking on the capacity of INEC to transmit all elections results in real-time, Yakubu said that from the reports available to the commission and its independent assessment INEC can transmit elections results to all the 774 local government areas and the 120,000 polling wards across the Federation.\n\nOn the BVAS, the INEC cha\u00ecrman said so far in the six by-elections in Ondo, Imo, Plateau and Cross Rivers states that there were no complaints against its operations\n\nHe pointed out the commission is not anticipating any extra budget to implement the new electoral law.\n\nPANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum Hail Buhari for Signing Electoral Law\n\nMeanwhile, the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; PANDEF and the MBF have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonna, told THISDAY yesterday that it was a welcome development that the president finally signed the bill into law.\n\nHe, therefore, challenged the INEC to ensure that nothing jeopardises the credibility of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe president had assured Nigerians that he will leave an improved electoral system by the time he serves out his tenure and we are glad that today, we now have an Electoral Act that substantially captures the key ingredients of a working, responsible and responsive democracy.\n\n\u201cThe President and National Assembly members have done their parts; it is now left for INEC to deliver. Let them know clearly that there\u2019s no room for excuses any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman however declared that the law would not completely remove malpractices from the nation\u2019s electoral system, explaining that the political actors would always seek ways of circumventing the system in their desperation for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had laws and the politicians know about that. One clear thing is that the malpractices are induced by the political elites. They will always find ways of achieving their plans. We are however hopeful that the situation will be appreciably reduced,\u201d he added.\n\nOn its part, PANDEF has also applauded President Buhari for signing into law the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe Forum, in a formal reaction by the spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, also called on the INEC to ensure the full implementation of the new electoral law.\n\nDescribing the president\u2019s assent to the bill as a welcome development after all the dilly-dally, Robinson said the action was perhaps the best thing President Buhari has done in terms of strengthening the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the National Assembly both deserve commendation. The ball is now in the court of the electoral commission to ensure that the Act is implemented to the letter in the entire electoral process, with adherence to every detail, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu, has also congratulated President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act into law, describing it as a welcome development.\n\nHe said Nigerians yearned to have a process that would translate to a transparent election that every Nigerian would trust.\n\nThe page however said it was not yet over, pointing out that INEC would need to do more to complement what the President has done, and ensure a credible election.\n\n\u201cWe welcome and congratulate Mr President for signing the Electoral Act into law.\n\n\u201cHaving signed, the job is not over yet, because we would want a two-stage transmission of results. First, INEC must ensure that in an election, the figures of accredited voters are first transmitted from the polling unit before the result of the election. This is to ensure that the figures of election results do not exceed the figures of accredited voters.\n\n\u201cIf that is not done, we are back to square one. The riggers out there will manipulate the system by writing the results at the polling units and asking the electoral officers to transmit what they have written. But if the accredited voters\u2019 figures are transmitted first, that will be difficult because the figure\u2019s results cannot be bloated above the accredited voters\u2019 figures.\n\n\u201cStage two is for the election results to be transmitted from the polling unit; these results must tally with figures of accredited voters in that polling unit.\n\nSo, we are calling on the National Assembly and INEC to ensure that this two-stage process is adhered to, to have a transparent and credible election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Aggregate money supply rises to N44.56tn\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nIn line with the resolve of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to halt a regime of arbitrage in the foreign exchange market, some Nigerian banks have started exposing the identities of customers, who allegedly obtained dollars by false pretence, and traded them at a profit in the parallel market.\n\nThis is coming as the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nSome bank customers have been taking advantage of the lucrative 37 per cent differential between the official and black market exchange rates by obtaining the dollar at the official rate of about N416, only to subsequently sell in the unauthorised market at a more expensive average rate of about N570.\n\nThese customers can beat regulations by presenting false travel documents, prompting the apex bank to direct banks to notify their customers of an impending crackdown on saboteurs in the forex market.\n\nHowever, a report by Bloomberg yesterday revealed that some banks have begun to implement the CBN\u2019s directives by publishing the names of clients found to have filed suspicious claims for forex transactions on their websites last week.\n\nFor instance, Zenith Bank Plc, the nation\u2019s biggest lender by market value, has published 987 names of customers engaging in the illegal practice on its website, Fidelity Bank Plc identified 83 customers; First City Monument Bank Plc listed eight names so far, while Wema Bank published one name. The list of banks that complied also included the United Bank for Africa Plc.\n\nThe apex bank had directed banks to identify such customers and ensure they refund the hard currency. The regulator first alerted banks of the ongoing practice last year.\n\nThe CBN had said: \u201cConsequently, further to the various measures already put in place, all banks are hereby directed to publish on their websites the names and BVN of defaulting customers who present fake travel documents or cancel their tickets and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed by them.\u201d\n\nSome deposit money banks acting on the directive of the CBN had sent notices to their customers warning that identities and Bank Verification Number (BVN) of those who contravene the apex bank\u2019s new forex policy on overseas personal and business travels would be published.\n\nThe CBN had also directed that travellers who buy foreign exchange from banks for travel purposes but fail to embark on the trip after two weeks of their scheduled travel date must return the forex to the banks.\n\nThe banks in their notices also pointed out consequences for those customers who engage in fraudulent and unethical practices with regards to the purchase of Personal Travel Allowances (PTA) and Business Travel Allowances (BTA).\n\nIn its notice to customers, one of the Tier 1 banks had said: \u201cWe have been directed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to inform all our customers that unethical practices to circumvent the new CBN policy on the sale of forex, such as the presentation of false travel documents, visas, and the cancellation of flight tickets, after purchasing personal travel allowance and business travel allowance, will no longer be tolerated.\n\n\u201cDefaulting customers who present fraudulent travel credentials or cancel their tickets and fail to refund the purchased PTA and BTA within two weeks, as stated in the signed customer declaration form, will have their identities and bank verification numbers published.\n\n\u201cWe aim to implement this policy immediately as an organisation that is fully compliant with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cOur bank is committed to partnering with the CBN to ensure a transparent, efficient and stable FX Market that meets the needs of all legitimate users.\u201d\n\nAggregate Money Supply Rises to N44.56tn in January\n\nMeanwhile, the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nA recently released Depository Corporations Survey by the apex bank, quoted by Cowry Asset Management Limited, showed that the growth was driven by a 1.46 per cent increase in M2 to N44.46 trillion and a sharp increase in CBN bills to N107.38 billion, from N100 million in the preceding month) amid efforts to rein in surplus liquidity.\n\nM2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and is easily convertible near money\n\nHowever, analysts from Cowry Asset Management Limited noted that the growth in central bank bills also came with its cost implications, as well as increased indebtedness of the apex bank.\n\nAccording to the latest edition of Cowry Financial Markets Review, Outlook & Recommended Stocks, growth in Broad Money supply was on the back of increases in Quasi Money (consisting of time deposits, near-maturing securities, foreign currencies, etc) and Narrow Money or M1 Money (comprising demand deposits and currency outside banks) by 0.34 per cent and 3.03 per cent to N25.74 trillion and N18.72 trillion, respectively.\n\n\u201cIncreases in quasi money may not be unconnected to, among other things, growing appetite of pension funds administrators to place retirement savings with commercial banks at relatively attractive interest rates. \u201cAs reported in the February 11, 2022 edition of our CWR, we observed that money moved out of T-bills securities to Local Money Market Securities (LMMS), especially bank placements,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt noted that the total funds invested in this investment category rose by 20.04 per cent to N2.03 trillion in December 2021 (lifting its share of the total assets to 15.09 per cent), from N1.69 trillion in December 2020 (or 13.71 per cent of total assets).\n\nThe CBN document was quoted as saying that that Reserve Money rose by 2.36 per cent to N13.61 trillion as bank reserves with the Central Bank increased by 3.51 per cent to N10.32 trillion (partly in tandem with increased deposits at the banks), to partly offset by a 5.52 per cent decline in currency outside banks to N2.78 trillion.\n\nOn the asset side, Net Domestic Credit grew by 2.49 per cent to N49.73 trillion as Credit to the Private Sector upped by 0.73 per cent to N35.45 trillion while Credit to the Government increased by 7.13 per cent to N14.28 trillion. However, Net Foreign Assets moderated by 1.79 per cent amid pressures on Nigeria\u2019s foreign sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowry Assets analysts have warned that the rise in the Narrow Money without a faster rise in GDP may result in higher inflation in 2022.\n\nIt noted that in 2021, the velocity of Narrow Money moderated to 10.16 times from 11.49 times in the preceding year even though Narrow Money rose by 14 per cent over the period, saying the productivity of the country needs a lot of improvement going forward.\n\nThe report warned that the escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and the attendant instability in the global oil market will exert pressure on the nation\u2019s external reserves.\n\nIt said: \u201cMeanwhile, in the wake of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, we are concerned that Nigeria would not optimally benefit from any ensuing rise in crude oil prices due to its suboptimal crude oil production. This would increase pressure on the external reserves as well as exchange rates as oil dollar revenues, its primary foreign currency earner, would struggle to meet the higher cost of imported refined products in addition to other imports.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nSeplat Energy has defended its acquisition of oil assets belonging to Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), in the face of global resistance to fossil fuels, explaining that it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the oil company was set to buy off oil and gas assets belonging to the International Oil Company (IOC) in a deal that could cost up to $1.2 billion, seen as the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari last year.\n\nIn addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement will see the company acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration, encompassing the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual interaction with journalists, Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy, Mr Roger Brown, argued that given the pillars upon which the future of the company is hinged, it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.\n\nHe added that Seplat already set up a subsidiary called Seplat Energy offshore limited that would be acquiring the business of MPNU.\n\nHe explained that employees of the selling company as well as all the existing contracts will be maintained, stating that the intention is to continue to run the assets profitably, since, according to him, they are already well managed.\n\nBut the Seplat CEO stated that the deal will still have to go through the statutory processes, including the competition commission and the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NURPC) as well as obtaining the consent of the minister of petroleum.\n\nHe noted that Seplat would continue the \u201cexcellent performance\u201d of the Mobil business, adding that the new entity has a slightly different plan in terms of cost-efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe do look for cost efficiencies. Our decision-making time, I think it\u2019s faster. Normally as compared to oil majors, that\u2019s what independents are there to do.\n\n\u201cAnd we are looking for operational efficiencies as well as cost reduction where we can touch on operating cost. We\u2019ve been successful in doing that in other existing businesses. And again over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in costs and losses in Seplat.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our strategy, which we laid in July last year, we set it out deliberately on three pillars. We have pillar one, which is our upstream oil and gas, business and pillar two business is the midstream gas business, going down into gas power.\n\n\u201c We made a decision before to look at the power opportunities and then our new energy, the bridge into renewable energy. That strategy has not changed.\n\n\u201cBut when we look at that strategy, if you look at the world today, the world today is going towards lower carbon, sort of wealthier countries in the world moving towards net-zero targets,\u201d he posited.\n\nDescribing gas as a transition fuel, Roger explained that the federal government was right when it declared a decade of gas recently.\n\nHe explained that the upstream gas will supply the company\u2019s midstream business in terms of oil, arguing that prices are likely to go into the much-expected supercycle given the lack of investment and the geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s important to efficiently get it (oil) out of the ground and then sell it and get these dollars to reinvest back into Nigeria to ensure that we\u2019re addressing other businesses.\n\n\u201cSo without the oil today, you don\u2019t have money to ensure you have a transition. And therefore, this transaction, what it does do is a big production. Its production will double what Seplat has today. So this short cycle production allows us to monetise it, and reinvest in other businesses,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe expressed confidence that contrary to the belief in certain quarters, fossil fuels will not go into extinction shortly, adding that stakeholders were beginning to realise that in the long run, any attempt to leave fossil fuels behind will lead to higher fuel prices.\n\nOil Prices Recede After Week\u2019s Peak of $105 Per Barrel\n\nMeanwhile, crude oil prices slipped yesterday, the last day of transaction for the week, after it went on overdrive a day earlier on the back of the Russia-Ukraine face-off.\n\nThe crude oil price had surged above $105 per barrel for the first time since 2014 after Russia attacked sites across Ukraine.\n\nThe situation signalled the worsening of an already tightening global supply market.\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an international group of oil producers, was already struggling to meet its production target before the latest threat.\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter and any impact on its production could markedly affect the market.\n\nIt is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe, providing over 35 per cent of its supply.\n\nBrent was up about six per cent on the day, paring gains after surging as much as 9.2 per cent to $105.79 a barrel after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe United States benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also briefly topped $100 a barrel before easing off of gains.\n\nBut on the last day of trading, the April Brent crude futures contract was down $1.06, or 1.1 per cent, at $98.02 per barrel in the afternoon after climbing as high as $101.99 per barrel. The active May contract shed 64 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $94.78.\n\nIn addition, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), United States crude, was down 31 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $92.50 a barrel, after hitting a session high of $95.64.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had caused prices to surge, with the assault seen as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenyan influencers were paid $10 to $15 to discredit controversial bills on Twitter",
          "text": "In the past 3 years, the Kenyan parliament has discussed two pieces of health legislation that has sparked online debates. The bills are the Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, also known as the Surrogacy Bill.\n\nAccording to a new report by Mozilla Foundation, Kenyans\u2019 conversations on Twitter on these health bills have been manipulated by disinformation campaigns sponsored by an anti-choice Spanish advocacy group, CitizenGO. The report shows that CitizenGO, a group that has been linked to the Spanish far-right, by exploiting the Twitter Trends algorithm, was able to input itself in these conversations in an attempt to influence debates around health bills.\n\nAccording to briefs seen by the researchers of the report, the messages the campaign used to attack activists contained cartoon caricatures and memes that echo messaging by American and European right-wing groups.\n\nThe Reproductive Healthcare Bill was introduced to the parliament in 2020 and is supposed to outlaw forced sterilisations; make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free and provide rights to reproductive healthcare services to every woman in Kenya, including adolescents. In 2021, the Surrogacy Bill proposed Kenyan politicians should develop standards and regulations around surrogacy\u2014an arrangement where a woman (a surrogate mother) carries a child in her belly on behalf of another woman, who receives the child after birth.\n\nOdanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation based in Nairobi, reviewed content posted between 2019 and 2021 and discovered that CitizenGo, and accounts linked to it, had tweeted 20,811 times and engaged in 11 campaigns\u2014when a large number of accounts tweeting using a predetermined hashtag or keyword. 10 of these problematic campaigns made it to the Trend section.\n\nThe Mozilla report reveals that CitizenGO paid the owner of these accounts or \u201cdisinformation influencers\u201d around $10 to $15 to make tailored tweets that discredited the bills.\n\nThe campaign made multiple false and misleading claims about surrogacy and reproductive health. For example, a tweet in the campaign claimed that children of surrogates display behavioural and emotional issues\u2014a claim the report revealed the African Population Health Research Center (APHRC) had debunked. Those tweets went on to attack journalists, activists and politicians that advocated for reproductive rights or the two reproductive bills.\n\nIn response to this report, Twitter has permanently suspended 240 accounts connected to this disinformation campaign for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.\n\nA booming disinformation industry\n\nLast year, Madung and Brian Obilo, another Mozilla fellow, discovered, through a series of interviews with social media influencers who coordinated disinformation attacks, were responsible for spreading the hashtag #AnarchistJudges. The tweets under this hashtag, which trended countrywide, cast suspicion on the competence and integrity of court officials that were against the Constitutional Amendments Bill of 2021 in Kenya.\n\nLike this campaign, it was also coordinated through WhatsApp and social media influencers were paid between 10$ to 15$ per campaign to tweet predetermined malicious tweets.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation report noted that the campaign had all the patterns of a disinformation campaign: heavy repetition of content under hashtags, newly created accounts tweeting political content, synchronised posting period and false tweets.\n\nHeightening Twitter Trend\u2019s criticism\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trends section helps users identify the most discussed topics on the platform and also help them find popular information or discussion. They vary depending on geographical location and personal interest.\n\nBut the feature has come under fire multiple times over the years for spreading hate and disinformation, and at some point, external critics and Twitter employees suggested eradicating the feature altogether, after it struggled to deal with disinformation around the US presidential election. One of Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up the feature was by adding more context to trending topics.\n\nMadung expressed concerns about the potential influence of these disinformation actors in the upcoming Kenya election: \u201cHealth is a political issue & more so reproductive health. As we mentioned in the report, there\u2019s clear evidence that these groups will be looking to exert their influence on candidates and citizens to ultimately affect the ballot in favour of candidates that agree with them.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that Twitter should assess individual countries and map out how the Trends section can be used to push disinformation; establish collaborations with local researchers, and develop a transparent partnership with fact-checkers and civil societies, all of whom can offer context about the region. Last year, Twitter was forced to disable the Trends feature in Ethiopia as it was increasingly used to push by warring parties to spread hate campaigns. By the way, researchers could not find any tangible impact of this intervention on the subsequent volume of hate speech on the platform.\n\nLast year, a Buzzfeed investigation revealed that Nigerian influencers paid to tweet in a coordinated manner successfully manipulated Twitter Trends in order to sway public opinion and court judgement in favour of Venezuelan politician, Alex Saab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to manipulate (content) in jurisdictions such as ours where the volume of content is not as high as countries such as the US,\u201d Madung tells TechCabal. With African countries increasingly vulnerable to disinformation actors on Twitter, a collaborative effort between Twitter, policymakers, civil societies and media organisations will be crucial to keep online discourse saner and difficult to manipulate.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway.\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited him home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. But I made a deployment error that cost the company $10,000.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "title": "What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after announcing its Series D round that sent its valuation over the $3 billion mark, African fintech startup, Flutterwave, at a virtual event, announced additional services to its existing offering. In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues. However, going by some of its appointments in the past year, the startup seems prepared for problems that may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRussian military activity in eastern Ukraine has increased recently, with threats of a larger invasion looming. Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, has unequivocally stated that Ukraine has no historical claim to independence; on Monday, February 21, 2022, he said that modern Ukraine was \u201centirely created by Russia.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, potentially igniting a European war over Russia\u2019s demands for an end to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) eastward expansion.\n\nBut what could have caused the conflict? While tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, had existed for some time, the situation began to spiral out of control in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged US president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to join NATO in January of last year. This infuriated Russia, which began sending troops near its Ukrainian border for \u201ctraining exercises\u201d and increased the number of troops sent in 2021.\n\nSadly, 14,000 people have died in Ukraine since 2014; I\u2019m sure many more will perish if caution is not exercised. Plus, I think this conflict has the potential to spark World War III. Do you think so? Leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) data protection laws have long been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d globally. Nonetheless, because technology has changed our lives in ways no one could have predicted in the last 25 years, the rules must be rewritten.\n\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, one of its most significant achievements in recent years. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, enacted when the Internet was in its infancy.\n\nAnd over the last four years, some progress has been made in protecting personal data since the GDPR was implemented.\n\nLarge technology companies have come under intense scrutiny. Due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing, they have had to backtrack and seek ways to protect user privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Facebook and Google are under increasing pressure to better balance privacy and ad targeting, with their fortunes on the line as users revolt, regulators loom, and Apple seizes the opportunity to improve its image.\n\nPer Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free as of December 2021; that figure is 94% on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut is Apple more secure than Google in terms of privacy?\n\nResearch shows that an iPhone or an Android device constantly sends data to Apple or Google, including your location, phone number, and local network details.\n\nSo, how do Google and Apple strike a balance between privacy concerns and profit motives? In the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo covered and provided more insight into this.\n\nPlease read the article here, The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022, and explosions have been reported in the country\u2019s east.\n\nWhy should you care? The cryptocurrency market has fallen sharply as the war in Ukraine escalated, with missiles continuing to pour down on the country\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and its airport being captured by airborne troops.\n\nThe missile reports have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, causing a selling hysteria that has resulted in a loss of nearly $500 million in liquidations for the entire crypto market as of the time of writing.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, $462.91 million in cryptocurrency has been \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 financially lost \u2013 since two nights ago, Wednesday, February 23, 2022. Also, the crypto market is down more than 10%, as many altcoins have suffered significant losses.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order occurred on Bitfinex, where LINK \u2013 an Ethereum token \u2013 worth $3.21 million was liquidated. During the sell-off, Bitcoin and Ethereum lost $129.95 million and $116.68 million, respectively.\n\nRecall that the flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s stock markets experienced a \u201cbloodbath\u201d at the start of the trading session on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe crash occurred as investors reacted to Western governments\u2019 promised sanctions in response to Putin\u2019s shocking announcement that Russia had launched military action against Ukraine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow Do We Take Care of Our Mental Health at Work?

DevPartners: According to Evans Data Corporation, there are an estimated 26.9 million software developers worldwide; however, according to the international finance corporation (IFC), there are an estimated 83,000 software developers in Nigeria. The data tells a story of the vast talent deficit in Nigeria. DevPartners is solving the tech talent shortage issue in the African tech space by working closely with the School of Ground Truth and other partners in developer communities in upskilling potential tech talent through training, internship, outsourcing, and funding. Communication Arc: This is the company\u2019s digital marketing arm, with a presence in some African countries.

          "title": "COVID 19: 103.7m Nigerians Not Fully Vaccinated",
          "text": "Two years after the first case of COVID -19 was detected in Nigeria, 103,745,586 out of the 111,776,503 eligible population targeted for COVID-19 vaccination to reach herd immunity against the disease have not been fully vaccinated.\n\nThough vaccination against COVID-19 commenced about a year after, the huge gap between eligible Nigerians and those vaccinated shows that Nigerians are not willing to be vaccinated.\n\nThe National Primary Health Development Agency (NPHCDA) COVID-19 vaccination update in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as of February 25, 2020 shows that 17,646,781 of eligible persons targeted for vaccination have received the first dose while 8,030,917 of total eligible persons targeted have received the second dose (fully vaccinated).\n\nThis indicates 15.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent respectively, meaning that 84.2 per cent of the target population are yet to receive the first dose while 92.7 per cent are yet to take their second shot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, experts have identified vaccine hesitancy as a main reason for the poor uptake. A professor from the department of pharmaceutical & medicinal chemistry, faculty of pharmaceutical sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Prof. Ikemefuna Uzochukwu, told LEADERSHIP Sunday that high COVID-19 hesitancy among Nigerians was attributed largely to safety and efficacy concerns, despite the approval of the vaccines by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\nVaccines Production: 3 Nigerian Varsities Get WHO Certification\n\nLack of trust in the vaccine sources, vaccine developers, donors and the Nigerian government; vaccine development within one year; lack of rigorous safety testing; several conspiracy theories; possibility of receiving a fake vaccine; fears of adverse effects and events were the major drivers of the concerns, Uzochukwu said.\n\n\u201cOther reasons for the unwillingness of some Nigerians to be vaccinated include disbelief over the existence of COVID-19 in Nigeria; poor knowledge of the new technology platforms used in the design and development of COVID-19 vaccine; belief that other preventive measures are enough protection; belief that the body\u2019s immunity is strong enough against the virus; the vaccine not needed if one is not infected with the virus; COVID-19 can be easily treated with medicines such as chloroquine,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUzochukwu however recommended that appropriately designed advocacy and behaviour-change communication messages that target the respective segments of Nigerians should be deployed to minimise vaccine hesitancy in the country.\n\nTo improve vaccination in the country, Tomori said COVID-19 vaccine should be made compulsory for all Nigerians, adding that it would enable the country to achieve herd immunity by 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment should ensure that the COVID-19 vaccine is enough to go round. In addition, the government should create more awareness on the importance of the non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 measures,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSince there are enough vaccines for the eligible population, the government should make it compulsory, but before then, the government must sensitise the public on the importance of the vaccine, not just to them, but the country at large,\u201d he added.\n\nA few days ago, the minister of health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said the proportion of fully vaccinated Nigerians was still very low.\n\nHe partly blamed the use of two-dose vaccine on the low vaccination in the country, saying most people were reluctant to take their second dose for various reasons including fear of a repeat of the mild side effects they may have experienced with the first dose.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEhanire assured Nigerians of adequate stock of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, saying, \u201cWe have over 30 million doses in stock. I call on all eligible persons that are yet to receive their vaccination to go to the nearest COVID-19 vaccination site and get vaccinated. This single dose offers the same protection you get from two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech and Moderna vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe minister also encouraged those who have received their first dose of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer vaccines to ensure they take their second dose when due, to be fully vaccinated and protected.\n\nHowever, in a contrary view, the head, pharmaceutical technology/nanomedicine, National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD), Prof. Martins Emeje, said the number of people that died from COVID-19 in Europe and America, cannot be compared to the number that died in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhich vaccines did we use that made us not to die? I am going to tell you the answer: no one. Does that not tell you that there is a vaccine in your own environment?\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria is not harnessing that local vaccine that protected us or doing more research to find out why Nigerians are not dying from the virus, despite the prediction by the western world and we are waiting for world leaders and international institutions to give us vaccine or wait for WHO to give us the go ahead to produce our own vaccine, then it shows that we are a brain lazy people,\u201d Emeje stated.\n\nHe, however, advocated that Nigeria needs to do more in research and development to produce locally medicines and vaccines for Nigerians, rather than wait for others to provide the country vaccines.",

We can rekindle values like tolerance, integrity, self-reliance, dignity and others using history as a tool. We have such a rich history filled with so many great characters and events. We can find strength and inspiration from this heritage. This is the vision of the Nigeria Heritage Series,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProfessor of Criminology, Etannibi Alemika, in his keynote address observed that it was a good thing that the organisers took the initiative to invite a lot of children who are the future of the country.\n\nHe identified primary education as the bedrock for all other levels of education, and urged the government through the ministry of education to redirect attention accordingly.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the ongoing tussle between the federal government and ASUU, he said the quantum of attention given to other levels of education like tertiary, at the expense of the primary, was just another example of the illogical reasoning that led to the neglect of History.\n\nThe special guest of honour, the minister for education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, stated that the Nigeria Heritage Series was quite an interesting project because it serves as a strategic supplement to the History curriculum at the basic education level.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepresented by the acting permanent secretary in the Ministry of Education Mr David K. Gende, the minister lauded the publishers for the excellent work done so far and urged them to develop more titles in the series.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari over his failure to promptly probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999, and to ensure the prosecution of those suspected to be responsible.\n\nThe suit followed Buhari\u2019s 2022 New Year Message in which he raised concerns about \u201cthe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country,\u201d and his promise in his 2015 inaugural speech to \u201ccheck gross corruption and ensure that there is accountability at all levels of government in the country.\u201d\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/189/2022 filed last week at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to direct Mr. Abubakar Malami SAN, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to direct Mr. Abubakar Malami SAN to prosecute anyone suspected to be responsible, as appropriate; if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to recover any mismanaged public funds.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that, \u201cCompelling the Federal Government to probe the spending of security votes since 1999 would ensure accountability, and improve the ability of the government to deliver on the promises to ensure the security of Nigerians, and to keep them safe.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application. Ending impunity for allegations of corruption in the spending of security votes and recovering any mismanaged public funds are matters of public interest.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cthe responsibility to guarantee and ensure the security and welfare of the Nigerian people is interlinked with the responsibility under Section 15(5) of the Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended] to \u2018abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of office.\u2019 This imposes a fundamental obligation to ensure accountability for the spending of security votes by state governors.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe government has the primary and constitutional responsibility to protect the lives and property of the Nigerian people. Section 14(2)(b) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that \u2018the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government\u2019.\u201d\n\nSERAP is further arguing that, \u201cPervasive tendency by public officers since 1999 to regard or treat security votes given to them for security of the state as their personal entitlement or funds is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution and international standards.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cSecurity votes should be used for improving the security situation in the states or returned to the public treasury.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as respondent is Mr. Malami.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Joke Fekumo, read in part: \u201cLongstanding allegations of mismanagement of security votes have hugely contributed to the growing insecurity in the country, and the failure to ensure the security and welfare of Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs revealed by a recent report by Transparency International (TI), most of the funds appropriated as security votes are spent on political activities, mismanaged or simply stolen. It is estimated that security votes add up to over N241.2 billion every year.\n\n\u201cOn top of appropriated security votes, state governments also receive millions of dollars yearly as international security assistance.\n\n\u201cArticles 5 and 9 of the UN Convention against Corruption impose legal obligations on the government to ensure proper management of public affairs and public funds, and to promote sound and transparent administration of public affairs.\n\n\u201cWhile sitting state governors may enjoy immunity from arrest and prosecution, they do not enjoy immunity from investigation. Any allegations of mismanagement of security votes against sitting governors can and should be investigated pending the time they leave office and lose immunity.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",
          "summary": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari over his failure to promptly probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999, and to ensure the prosecution of those suspected to be responsible.\nIt is estimated that security votes add up to over N241.2 billion every year.\n\u201cOn top of appropriated security votes, state governments also receive millions of dollars yearly as international security assistance.\n\u201cWhile sitting state governors may enjoy immunity from arrest and prosecution, they do not enjoy immunity from investigation.\nAny allegations of mismanagement of security votes against sitting governors can and should be investigated pending the time they leave office and lose immunity.\u201dNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

These voter empowerment machines combined to revolutionise free, fair and transparent elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cElectronic Transmission of results is the key element in the Act and will automatically boost voters\u2019 turn out to 60 per cent in future elections.\n\n\u201cIt is the lofty milestone and indeed, comes as one of the progressive legacies of Mr President who, as a victim of vote-rigging has always craved for law instrument that contains progressive provisions to knock out thuggery during accreditation, voting and collation processes.\n\n\u201cBy consolidating the power of votes to count and transparently so counted, President Buhari has finally empowered the people to come out in large numbers to choose their leaders without the interference of the dreaded Money Bags.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he expressed hope that Nigerians will be less attracted by stomach infrastructure or vote-buying and need not protest or demonstrate against the missiles.\n\nFurthermore, he maintained that with the Vote-Rigging-Vaccine (VRV) strengthened by the black ink of the law, Nigerians can now troop out to voting booths on Election Day with confidence that their votes would vote out bad leaders.\n\nHe said the battle between leaders and the led over accountability has shifted to the ballot box and the social contracts strengthened to be honoured.\n\nHowever, he urged Nigerians to always reflect on the remarks by Buhari when he signed the bill, especially when the President said, \u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive.\n\n\u201cI am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potential of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3,9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okechukwu, Mr President\u2019s statement not only offers hope for a better democratic culture forever in our dear country but also reinforces our long hope to become truly the giant of Africa.\n\nOkechukwu also appealed to INEC to put its acts together to give life to VRV; the ultimate instrument of Voters Empowerment and democratic Risorgimento in Nigeria.\n\nFor political parties, he cautioned them to beware for Buhari\u2019s VRV is a searchlight on their commitment to internal democracy and the building of a united and inclusive country.\n\nNAN",

They also kidnapped an unspecified number of people during the operation.\n\nSimilarly, bandits also blocked the Kaduna- Birnin-Gwari Road at about 10 am on Saturday morning and attacked motorists. According to the Chairman of Birnin-Gwari Vanguards for Security and Good Governance, Ibrahim Nagwari, a final year student of Science Secondary School, Birnin-Gwari, who was on his way to Kaduna for the JAMB- UMTE registration and three other passengers, escaped with bullet wounds, as the armed bandits sprayed bullets on their vehicle at Manini village along Birnin-Gwari Kaduna Highway.\n\nNagwari said that the student is awaiting surgery for the removal of the bullet on his shoulder at Jibrin Maigwari General Hospital in Birnin-Gwari. While commending the local government authorities for taking care of the hospital bills of those injured in the attacks, the residents called on the government to as a matter of urgency set up a special centre for JAMB examinations in Birnin-Gwari in order to reduce the risk of students travelling far down to Kaduna for registration",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cover the failure to promptly and thoroughly probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999, and to ensure the prosecution of those suspected to be responsible\u201d.\n\nThe suit followed Buhari\u2019s 2022 New Year Message in which he raised concerns about \u201cthe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country,\u201d and his promise in his 2015 inaugural speech to \u201ccheck gross corruption and ensure that there is accountability at all levels of government in the country\u201d.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/189/2022, filed last week at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to direct Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999\u201d.\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to direct Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN) to prosecute anyone suspected to be responsible, as appropriate; if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to recover any mismanaged public funds\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Electoral Act] Buhari Institutionalising Credible Elections in Nigeria \u2013 APC\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that \u201cCompelling the Federal Government to probe the spending of security votes since 1999 would ensure accountability, and improve the ability of the government to deliver on the promises to ensure the security of Nigerians, and to keep them safe\u201d.\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application. Ending impunity for allegations of corruption in the spending of security votes and recovering any mismanaged public funds are matters of public interest\u201d.\n\nIt maintained that \u201cthe responsibility to guarantee and ensure the security and welfare of the Nigerian people is interlinked with the responsibility under Section 15(5) of the Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended] to \u2018abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of office.\u2019 This imposes a fundamental obligation to ensure accountability for the spending of security votes by state governors\u201d.\n\nAlso, the agency said, \u201cThe government has the primary and constitutional responsibility to protect the lives and property of the Nigerian people. Section 14(2)(b) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that \u2018the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government\u2019\u201d.\n\nSERAP further said \u201cPervasive tendency by public officers since 1999 to regard or treat security votes given to them for [the] security of the state as their personal entitlement or funds is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution and international standards\u201d.\n\n\u201cSecurity votes should be used for improving the security situation in the states or returned to the public treasury,\u201d it added.\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondent is Mr Malami.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Joke Fekumo read in part: \u201cLongstanding allegations of mismanagement of security votes have hugely contributed to the growing insecurity in the country, and the failure to ensure the security and welfare of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs revealed by a recent report by Transparency International (TI), most of the funds appropriated as security votes are spent on political activities, mismanaged or simply stolen. It is estimated that security votes add up to over N241.2 billion every year. On top of appropriated security votes, state governments also receive millions of dollars yearly as international security assistance.\n\n\u201cArticles 5 and 9 of the UN Convention against Corruption impose legal obligations on the government to ensure proper management of public affairs and public funds, and to promote sound and transparent administration of public affairs.\n\n\u201cWhile sitting state governors may enjoy immunity from arrest and prosecution, they do not enjoy immunity from investigation. Any allegations of mismanagement of security votes against sitting governors can and should be investigated pending the time they leave office and lose immunity.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "title": "Russian Troops Enter Ukraine\u2019s 2nd Largest City Kharkiv as Invasion Continues",
          "text": "Street fighting broke out in Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city Sunday and Russian troops put increasing pressure on strategic ports in the country\u2019s south following a wave of attacks on airfields and fuel facilities elsewhere that appeared to mark a new phase of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nFollowing its gains on the ground, Russia sent a delegation to Belarus for peace talks with Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. Ukraine\u2019s president suggested other locations, saying his country was unwilling to meet in Belarus because it served as a staging ground for the invasion.\n\nUntil Sunday, Russia\u2019s troops had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) south of the border with Russia, while other forces rolled past to press the offensive deeper into Ukraine.\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and a light vehicle burning on the street. Ukrainian forces engaged them, according to Oleh Sinehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration. He gave no further details, but told civilians not to leave their homes. He gave no further details.\n\nAs Russia pushes ahead with its offensive, the West is working to equip the outnumbered Ukrainian forces with weapons and ammunition while punishing Russia with far-reaching sanctions intended to further isolate Moscow.\n\nHuge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday near the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale assault by Russian forces.\n\nFlames billowed into the sky before dawn from an oil depot near an air base in Vasylkiv, where there has been intense fighting, according to the town\u2019s mayor. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said another explosion was at the civilian Zhuliany airport.\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s office also said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, prompting the government to warn people to protect themselves from the smoke by covering their windows with damp cloth or gauze.\n\n\u201cWe will fight for as long as needed to liberate our country,\u201d Zelenskyy vowed.\n\nTerrified men, women and children sought safety inside and underground, and the government maintained a 39-hour curfew to keep people off the streets. More than 150,000 Ukrainians fled for Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries, and the United Nations warned the number could grow to 4 million if fighting escalates.\n\nRussia\u2019s military also put increasing pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine, blocking the strategic cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said.\n\nHe said the Russian forces also have taken control of an air base near Kherson and the city of Henichesk on the Azov Sea. Ukrainian authorities previously have reported fighting in various areas along the coast.\n\nAs Russia has closed in on the Ukrainian capital, it has also focused on pressing its offensive in the country\u2019s south in an apparent bid to take control of its coast stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east.\n\nThe Ukrainian authorities have reported fighting going on near Odesa, Mykolaiv and other areas.\n\nRussia\u2019s advances along Ukraine\u2019s coast mark an attempt to cut the country\u2019s access to its sea ports that would deal a major blow to its economy. The offensive in the south also could allow Moscow to build a land corridor to Crimea, which until now was connected to Russia by a 19-kilometer (12-mile) bridge, the longest bridge in Europe which opened in 2018.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin hasn\u2019t disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine\u2019s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era influence.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a Russian delegation of military officials and diplomats had arrived Sunday in the Belarusian city of Hormel for talks with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Russian delegation is ready for talks and we are now waiting for the Ukrainians,\u201d he said. The Ukrainians have said they are ready for peace talks but will not accept ultimatums.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president said his country was ready for peace talks with Russia but not in Belarus given the Russian ally\u2019s role in the invasion. Speaking in a video message Sunday, Zelenskyy named Warsaw, Bratislava, Istanbul, Budapest or Baku as alternative venues. He said other locations are also possible.\n\nTo aid Ukraine\u2019s ability to hold out, the U.S. pledged an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.\n\nThe U.S., European Union and United Kingdom agreed to block \u201cselected\u201d Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose \u201crestrictive measures\u201d on Russia\u2019s central bank.\n\nResponding to a request from Ukraine\u2019s minister of digital transformation, tech billionaire Elon Musk said on Twitter his satellite-based internet system Starlink was now active in Ukraine and that there were \u201cmore terminals en route.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear how much territory Russian forces had seized or to what extent their advance had been stalled. Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense said \u201cthe speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.\u201d\n\nA senior U.S. defense official said more than half the Russian combat power that was massed along Ukraine\u2019s borders had entered the country and Moscow has had to commit more fuel supply and other support units inside Ukraine than originally anticipated. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. assessments.\n\nThe curfew forcing everyone in Kyiv inside was set to last through Monday morning. The relative quiet of the capital was sporadically broken by gunfire.\n\nFighting on the city\u2019s outskirts suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. Small groups of Russian troops were reported inside Kyiv, but Britain and the U.S. said the bulk of the forces were 19 miles (30 kilometers) from the city\u2019s center as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nRussia claims its assault on Ukraine from the north, east and south is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighborhoods have been hit.\n\nUkraine\u2019s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded during Europe\u2019s largest land war since World War II. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.\n\nA missile struck a high-rise apartment building in Kyiv\u2019s southwestern outskirts near one of the city\u2019s two passenger airports, leaving a jagged hole of ravaged apartments over several floors. A rescue worker said six civilians were injured.\n\nUkraine\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said troops in Kyiv were fighting Russian \u201csabotage groups.\u201d Ukraine says some 200 Russian soldiers have been captured and thousands killed.\n\nMarkarova said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to The Hague as possible crimes against humanity.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated his openness to talks with Russia in a video message, saying he welcomed an offer from Turkey and Azerbaijan to organize diplomatic efforts, which so far have faltered.\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed a phone call between Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev but gave no hint of restarting talks. A day earlier, Zelenskyy offered to negotiate a key Russian demand: abandoning ambitions of joining NATO.\n\nPutin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so, all the while building up a force of almost 200,000 troops along the countries\u2019 borders. He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia\u2019s security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine\u2019s right to exist as an independent state.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have beefed up forces on NATO\u2019s eastern flank but so far have ruled out deploying troops to fight Russia. Instead, the U.S., the European Union and other countries have slapped wide-ranging sanctions on Russia, freezing the assets of businesses and individuals including Putin and his foreign minister.\n\nNPR",

We would not hesitate to go extra miles to correct the \u2018misnormal\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe action of Air Peace is sentimental and unprofessional and we can go any length to defend and protect any act of insensitivity against our prestigious traditional institution.\n\n\u201cThat insult is not heaped on the Emir alone but on the good people of Kano and folding our hands on this could trigger something worse and more ridiculous.\n\n\u201cI wrote to the DG NCAA, to complain but if someone claimed my statement is inciting, well, they are entitled to their opinion. But come to think of it, inciting who? Kano people not to fly Air Peace anymore because the airline insulted their emir and refused to apologise? That I have no regret if anybody claimed or interprets my complaint that way.\n\n\u201cAfter all, Air Peace has been in business before coming to Kano and Kano people have been flying across the world without Air Peace. So if that is what he wanted, so be it, we will get there.\n\n\u201cI am a professional pilot. I have flown five Heads of State besides being a prince of Kano, and I am a personal friend to the Chairman of Air Peace, Mr. Onyema.\u201dIbrahim Shuaib in Kano",

          "text": "Seplat Energy has defended its acquisition of oil assets belonging to Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), in the face of global resistance to fossil fuels, explaining that it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the oil company was set to buy off oil and gas assets belonging to the International Oil Company (IOC) in a deal that could cost up to $1.2 billion, seen as the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari last year.\n\nIn addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement will see the company acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration, encompassing the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual interaction with journalists, Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy, Mr Roger Brown, argued that given the pillars upon which the future of the company is hinged, it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.\n\nHe added that Seplat already set up a subsidiary called Seplat Energy offshore limited that would be acquiring the business of MPNU.\n\nHe explained that employees of the selling company as well as all the existing contracts will be maintained, stating that the intention is to continue to run the assets profitably, since, according to him, they are already well managed.\n\nBut the Seplat CEO stated that the deal will still have to go through the statutory processes, including the competition commission and the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NURPC) as well as obtaining the consent of the minister of petroleum.\n\nHe noted that Seplat would continue the \u201cexcellent performance\u201d of the Mobil business, adding that the new entity has a slightly different plan in terms of cost-efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe do look for cost efficiencies. Our decision-making time, I think it\u2019s faster. Normally as compared to oil majors, that\u2019s what independents are there to do.\n\n\u201cAnd we are looking for operational efficiencies as well as cost reduction where we can touch on operating cost. We\u2019ve been successful in doing that in other existing businesses. And again over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in costs and losses in Seplat.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our strategy, which we laid in July last year, we set it out deliberately on three pillars. We have pillar one, which is our upstream oil and gas, business and pillar two business is the midstream gas business, going down into gas power.\n\n\u201c We made a decision before to look at the power opportunities and then our new energy, the bridge into renewable energy. That strategy has not changed.\n\n\u201cBut when we look at that strategy, if you look at the world today, the world today is going towards lower carbon, sort of wealthier countries in the world moving towards net-zero targets,\u201d he posited.\n\nDescribing gas as a transition fuel, Roger explained that the federal government was right when it declared a decade of gas recently.\n\nHe explained that the upstream gas will supply the company\u2019s midstream business in terms of oil, arguing that prices are likely to go into the much-expected supercycle given the lack of investment and the geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s important to efficiently get it (oil) out of the ground and then sell it and get these dollars to reinvest back into Nigeria to ensure that we\u2019re addressing other businesses.\n\n\u201cSo without the oil today, you don\u2019t have money to ensure you have a transition. And therefore, this transaction, what it does do is a big production. Its production will double what Seplat has today. So this short cycle production allows us to monetise it, and reinvest in other businesses,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe expressed confidence that contrary to the belief in certain quarters, fossil fuels will not go into extinction shortly, adding that stakeholders were beginning to realise that in the long run, any attempt to leave fossil fuels behind will lead to higher fuel prices.\n\nOil Prices Recede After Week\u2019s Peak of $105 Per Barrel\n\nMeanwhile, crude oil prices slipped yesterday, the last day of transaction for the week, after it went on overdrive a day earlier on the back of the Russia-Ukraine face-off.\n\nThe crude oil price had surged above $105 per barrel for the first time since 2014 after Russia attacked sites across Ukraine.\n\nThe situation signalled the worsening of an already tightening global supply market.\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an international group of oil producers, was already struggling to meet its production target before the latest threat.\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter and any impact on its production could markedly affect the market.\n\nIt is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe, providing over 35 per cent of its supply.\n\nBrent was up about six per cent on the day, paring gains after surging as much as 9.2 per cent to $105.79 a barrel after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe United States benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also briefly topped $100 a barrel before easing off of gains.\n\nBut on the last day of trading, the April Brent crude futures contract was down $1.06, or 1.1 per cent, at $98.02 per barrel in the afternoon after climbing as high as $101.99 per barrel. The active May contract shed 64 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $94.78.\n\nIn addition, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), United States crude, was down 31 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $92.50 a barrel, after hitting a session high of $95.64.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had caused prices to surge, with the assault seen as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
