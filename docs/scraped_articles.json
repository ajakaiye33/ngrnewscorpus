          "title": "Ending insurgencies: When solidarity matches resilience",
          "text": "Sometime in late 2014, news broke that 43 students travelling in a bus to join a demonstration in Mexico City had disappeared without a trace. I remember being mystified that many people could disappear as though they were sailing through the Bermuda triangle.\n\nIt is only now that the mystery has been unravelled, that is seven years later. Using text messages, investigators have now determined how the students from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa, Mexico, got rounded up and murdered.\n\n\u201cThe new evidence that has come to light regarding the Ayotzinapa case cracks it wide open and provides irrefutable proof of who was involved in the student massacre,\u201d an official of the US Drug Enforcement Agency told the Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThe story of the massacre of the students in Ayotzinapa is like a Hollywood movie, but the events are real. They involve collusion between the police, army, organised crime, and a massive coverup by the Mexican government.\u201d\n\nIt is a long story. The gist of it is this: The students crossed a powerful Mexican drug lord. He ordered their arrest and execution. The police and army complied. And the government looked the other way.\n\nIt is a chilling story. Though it has nothing to do with insurgencies per se, one cannot read it without seeing how they relate.\n\nEven then, the purpose of this article is not to dwell on that. The problem of complicity regarding Boko Haram and banditry has been abundantly established. And so is what Nnamdi Obasi of the International Crisis Group calls a \u201cserious deficit of will.\u201d\n\nWhat is most pertinent now is an emerging solidarity against evil. Whereas Islamist violence was most worrisome to southerners and people of the Middle Belt, it is even more so now to people of the core North. Accordingly, it is becoming less politicised.\n\nHere is Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal bemoaning a recent massacre of villagers in his state: \u201cBetween last night, yesterday evening till this morning, we were greeted with a very dastardly attack in Goronyo local government, particularly Goronyo township, where scores and tens have lost their lives and still counting. We\u2019re not sure of the figure. But it is 30 something.\u201d\n\nTambuwal added that it is a \u201cvery trying moment\u201d and that Nigeria is \u201cbedevilled by many security challenges in our own area here, particularly banditry, kidnapping and other associated crimes.\u201d\n\nSokoto State lawmaker Amina Al-Mustapha added: \u201cWe are under bandits now\u2026. No single village has not been attacked.\u201d\n\nTambuwal and Al-Mustapha both spoke matter-of-factly, with no tinge of politics. That wasn\u2019t the case in 2014 when Tambuwal precipitated a political crisis by defecting to the All Progressives Congress. At the time, he was the Speaker of the House. And the question arose as to whether he could retain a position that was enabled by his membership of the majority party, the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nAt the time, then President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration was battling against Boko Haram. There were reported instances of subversion within the administration. And the whole pattern of defections and other political machinations undermined Jonathan\u2019s efforts.\n\nTambuwal is now back in the PDP and his state, like others in the North-West, is besieged by bandits. There must be some reassessment going on.\n\nIn any case, after a long period of relative inaction or \u201cserious deficit of will,\u201d the military finally undertook a resolute campaign to root out the bandits from their hideouts in the forests. From all indications, it has had considerable success. At least, the kidnapping of school children has abated.\n\nBut then, much like Boko Haram, the bandits are proving resilient. Apparently in revenge for the military\u2019s success against them, they are now engaging in unconscionable massacres of defenceless villagers.\n\nLt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, the Army Chief of Staff, is touring these areas to observe and listen. So, it is improbable that he would relent on the anti-bandits campaign he recently instituted. So, if the bandits think that massacres of defenceless villagers will deter further campaigns against them, they\u2019re probably mistaken.\n\nEven then, unfortunately, Nigerians have to brace for violence from bandits for quite a while. My sense is that those who were engaging in banditry for profit are the ones who have surrendered in droves or otherwise abandoned the heinous way of life. Those that are conducting the reprisals must be motivated by deeper convictions, such as an Islamist agenda.\n\nIt has long been speculated that the bandits are actually Boko Haram fighters or that they merely infiltrated the bandits. The current mindless bloodletting suggests that one or the other is true.\n\nBoko Haram, like other Islamist insurgencies, has proven to be resilient. It doesn\u2019t matter where they are engaged, their deep convictions give them the proverbial cat\u2019s nine lives. That\u2019s why Mali is in danger of becoming another Afghanistan. The only way to combat them is through equal resolve and solidarity both within and across nations.\n\nThat\u2019s made easier now that a vast majority of Muslims have come to realise that Islamists are just as inimical to them as they are to Christians. But beyond that, there has to be the realisation that secular governance is the key to co-existence. It is the only form of government that guarantees the right of all faiths, as well as the faithless.\n\nTalking of Afghanistan and secular governance, the Taliban is now embroiled in a war with an equally resilient Islamist group, the Islamic State. Why? Because the Taliban is predominantly Shiite and the IS is predominantly Sunni. The two sects have engaged in bloodletting elsewhere, including especially Iraq.\n\nThe solution is secular governance at all levels: local, state and federal. And that has to be the converging point of solidarity against Islamists.\n\nColin Powell: Soldier-statesman\n\nThere are few people that to me embody (or embodied) the good in humanity. Among them are Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter and Colin Powell. Unlike the first two, Powell who died on Monday at age 84, was never a president. But he could have been, if it weren\u2019t \u2014 as he declared in 1995 \u2014 that he didn\u2019t have the \u201cfire in the belly.\u201d\n\nIronically, the lack of fire in the belly was precisely what could have made him a great president. He rose to the highest ranks in the US military because it is an institution steeped in the ethos of honour and performance. Politics is a different matter, and so he resisted the pressure to run.\n\nInstead, he devoted his life to service, including as the US Secretary of State. On retirement, he continued to serve as the political conscience of the nation. Though a Republican, he didn\u2019t hesitate to repudiate policies of Republicans that he deemed wrong.\n\nAs Secretary of State, it fell upon him to persuade the United Nations in 2003 that Saddam Hussein was stocking weapons of mass destruction. His credibility lent broad support for the subsequent invasion of Iraq. When it turned out that there were no such weapons, Powell readily expressed regrets for making the case. He could have engaged in political obfuscation, but he was too much of a man of honour.\n\nWhen, therefore, news came of his death, there was a universal sense of loss. He led an inspiring life.\n\n[email protected]\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Soldiers\u2019 invasion of Imo community, indefensible",
          "text": "A decade after it took the law into its own hands by invading Zaki-Biam town and surrounding villages in Benue State, the Nigerian Army re-enacted that abhorrent trademark when soldiers invaded Izombe, Oguta Local Government Area, Imo State on October 8. According to Human Rights Watch, the soldiers, during their revenge attack for the alleged killing of 19 troops, massacred hundreds of civilians in the Benue incident in October 2001. Nothing much has changed since then, as the latest military atrocities suggest.\n\nThis time around, troops from the 34 Artillery Brigade, Obinze, Owerri, invaded the oil-producing villages of Eziorsu, Osobodo and Umuokwu in Izombe, leaving scores dead. Over 80 houses were razed to the ground, and 15 vehicles and 25 motorcycles were destroyed. The villagers had no option other than to flee their homes to neighbouring communities and bushes seeking refuge.\n\nAmong the victims was Pa Iwundu, 87, who was said to be in his room when the rampaging soldiers threw a stick of dynamite on the roof of his house, leaving parts of his body scalded. The family house of a journalist, Francis Onyeukwu, who is the Anambra State correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria, was burnt down by the invading army.\n\nThe PUNCH investigation indicated that the bone of contention had to do with the sharing of proceeds from illegal refining of crude oil, which was going on unabated in the community. The report said that the altercation between the soldiers and some youths over the \u201csharing formula of the proceeds\u201d led to the soldiers killing one of the boys Chukwunonso Iherue, from Umuokwu-Izombe, also known as Obera. Angered, the young people reportedly attacked the military men. The attack led to the alleged killing of two soldiers, the burning of their vehicle, and the loss of three service rifles.\n\nThe surviving soldiers, it was reported, hurried back to the barracks in Obinze, about 34 kilometres away, for reinforcement and invaded the community in over 40 vehicles, and four armoured personnel carriers.\n\nA community leader from Umuokwu village, James Imo, said, \u201cThe problem arose from a misunderstanding between the youth and soldiers over crude oil bunkering activities.\u201d The angry youths, on learning of the alleged killing of one of them, fought back, overpowered the soldiers, and as well took their guns and burnt their vehicle. An eyewitness said the soldiers ran to the palace of the traditional ruler for refuge, but the mob stormed the palace, brought them out and killed them.\n\nNo doubt, the locals involved crossed a red line by committing this horrific crime. The raging lawlessness and extrajudicial killings in the South-East is turning the region into a lawless society. It is reported that no fewer than 115 persons have been allegedly killed by security agents between March and June. Coincidentally, there have been several attacks and murders of security personnel, as well as stealing, unlawful possession of firearms, arson, and malicious damage to operational assets of the military and law enforcement agents.\n\nThis state of anomie is utterly despicable and condemnable, especially happening under a democracy supposedly being governed by the rule of law. It is only in a state of anarchy that such a descent into lawlessness and brigandage can occur without dire consequences.\n\nAs condemnable as the alleged killing of the soldiers by the angry youths is, the impunity of the soldiers is similarly reprehensible and unacceptable. Resorting to self-help by invading the community and unleashing mayhem on hapless citizens is outside the rules of engagement governing military operations in all democratic societies. A former director of the HRW, Ugandan-born Peter Takirambudde, said \u201cthe security forces have to protect, not to attack, the population.\u201d This is nothing but the truth.\n\nIn a democracy, the military is subject to political control. Unfortunately, that seems not to be the case in Nigeria where security forces act with impunity and ride roughshod over the citizens. This should not be allowed to continue. The involvement of soldiers in internal security in the country should also be reviewed. It does not bode well for harmonious civil-military relations. This explains the recurrent human rights violations and extrajudicial killings reported across major towns and cities of the country. At present, officers and men of the Nigerian Army are deployed in all the 36 states of the federation battling terrorism, kidnapping, cattle rustling, pipeline vandalism, communal clashes, and other forms of insecurity. All these responsibilities could have been well taken care of by functional, decentralised police, controlled at the sub-national levels by the governors. Sadly, years of underfunding and centralisation of the Nigeria Police have left the force under-resourced, ill-equipped, and unable to carry out its statutory task of securing the country. To deal with emergent security challenges without incurring more collateral damage, policing should be decentralised.\n\nTo serve as a deterrent to others, we reiterate that the military authorities should be made to fish out for prosecution of all those involved in the Izombe invasion. Of course, there are fears that nothing would be done by the authorities, the same way those who orchestrated the massacres of innocent Nigerians in Zaki-Biam in Benue State and Odi in Bayelsa State under the Olusegun Obasanjo administration have gone off the hook. There is no place for such brazenness in a decent society.\n\nThe Federal Government and defence authorities owe Nigerians a duty to investigate the incident, identify the perpetrators of the dastardly act and bring them to book. This is the right way to give justice to the victims of the invasion.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Foods, herbs to manage male infertility",
          "text": "Do you know that walnuts (Asala) can make men become dads? Do you also know that mumps can cause male infertility? If your male child develops it, you must take him to the hospital for proper treatment. By the way, mumps is a viral infection that affects the parotid glands (salivary glands) below and in front of the ears. It is popularly called \u201cSegede\u201d in Yoruba.\n\nThis week, I will talk about male infertility. I will also give more of non-indigenous herbs. I had a chat with the CEO of towgfoods, Mr Jazmel Deen. He gave me lists of some herbs that are effective in treating male infertility. Some of them are maca, ashwagandha, tribulus\n\npanax ginseng, mucuna, muirapuama, ginkgo biloba, saw palmetto, shilajit, tongkat ali.\n\nSome risk factors of male infertility are\n\nSmoking tobacco\n\nExcessive consumption of alcohol\n\nUsing certain illicit drugs\n\nBeing overweight\n\nHaving certain past or present infections\n\nBeing exposed to toxins\n\nOverheating the testicles\n\nHaving experienced trauma to the testicles\n\nHaving a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery\n\nHaving a history of undescended testicles\n\nBeing born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder.\n\nHaving certain medical conditions like tumours and chronic illnesses such as sickle cell disease\n\nTaking certain medications or undergoing medical treatments such as surgery or radiation used for treating cancer.\n\nBeneficial herbs\n\nGuava leaves\n\nPhoenix dactylifera (Dates)\n\nNigella sativa (black seed)\n\nWithania somnifera\n\n(Ashwagandha)\n\nAfromomum melegueta (ataare)\n\nTribulus tertestris\n\nMondia whitei (Isirigun)\n\nCissus populnea (Afato)\n\nMucuna pruriens (werepe)\n\nAsparagus racemosus (Shatavari )\n\nSida cordifolia (Bala)\n\nAsphaltum (Shilajit)\n\nPiper longum (Pippali)\n\nLifestyle changes and foods\n\nLose weight if you are overweight\n\nQuit smoking\n\nAvoid alcohol, drug abuse and certain medications that may reduce sperm production\n\nLimit exposure to environmental and occupational contaminants\n\nLimit the consumption of soy and estrogen-rich foods\n\nEat more antioxidant-rich foods like the ones rich in vitamin C and beta-carotene.\n\nCut back on processed meat, try fish instead\n\nBe careful with trans fats (eat less fried junk food)\n\nEat nuts especially walnuts. Eat Zinc-rich foods such as beans, nuts, certain types of seafood including crab and lobster. Eat seeds like pumpkin seeds. Dark chocolate is good for you too.\n\nDo not over indulge in high-fat dairy like ice cream, whole milk etc.\n\nIncrease your fruits and vegetables intake.\n\nScientific studies\n\nIn a study titled, \u201cEffects of the aqueous extract of dry seeds of Aframomum melegueta(ataare) on some parameters of the reproductive function of mature male rats,\u2019\u2019 by Yolande Mbongue et al, the conclusion is that the aqueous extract of A. melegueta increased the secretions of epididymis and seminal vesicle, which are accessory sex organs.\n\nThe assessment of the spermatogenic effects of aqueous extract of Cissus populnea stem bark was done in a study titled, \u201cStudy of the Aqueous Extract as Potential Spermatogenic Enhancers in Male Wistar Rat,\u2019\u2019 by Ojekale, the oral administration of C. populnea extract over a 64-day period to male wistar rats resulted in a four-fold increase in sperm count.\n\nOne study of 75 men with low sperm concentration, decreased motility and abnormal sperm morphology attending a fertility clinic in Malaysia found that taking 200 mg of Eurycoma longifolia (Tongkat Ali) per day improves sperm motility and count.\n\nIn an in vitro study where human sperm from 40 healthy males was incubated with extracts of the Tribulus Terrestris herb, both sperm motility and count were enhanced.\n\nA small study of nine healthy men taking 1500 or 3000 mg of maca root found that after four months, semen volume, sperm count and sperm motility were all improved.\n\nObviously, enlarged veins in the testes (varicocele), undescended testicles, infections and some other factors can affect sperm production. See your doctor.\n\nAnd so, we have come to the end of this series. I want us to move on. Did you notice that all the diseases identified being overweight as a risk factor? Maintaining a healthy weight goes a long way in enjoying sound health. You have to also pay attention to your diet because you are what you eat.\n\nAfter the article on prostate enlargement was published, the only text messages I got were what are the local names of the non-indigenous herbs listed? I was disturbed because it made it look like, \u201cYou did not say anything meaningful in that article, just provide the local names\u201d What about all the lifestyle changes I enumerated? How many times have you taken a walk? I listed foods, have you changed your diet from those junks to healthy foods? The truth is that a healthy diet and an active lifestyle go a long way in having sound health. Your medications and herbs are not enough.\n\nIf I am not able to provide local names of certain herbs, then it is either the local names are controversial and I would not want you to ingest wrong herbs or they may be non-indigenous herbs. How do I give local names to herbs that are not native to Africa? I assure you that if you ever need any of the non-indigenous herbs, I will give you directions on where to buy them. Many people now have the Mondia whitei and Tribulus terrestris they asked for.\n\nA reader felt I was discouraging the consumption of indigenous fruits by giving lists of exotic fruits in one of the articles. I have never said people should not eat indigenous fruits. Besides, vegetables such as Broccoli, cabbage, green peas and even brown rice that I mentioned in the said article are no longer strange in this clime.\n\nFor people who asked questions about Psyllium husk for constipation, the suggested intake of psyllium husks to treat constipation is one teaspoon three times per day. The powder should be mixed into a full glass of water before swallowing. If it is the capsules you are able to get, it should be swallowed whole with a full glass of water. Take after a meal. It is important to drink a good amount of fluid while taking psyllium.\n\nI have received text messages from men who complain that their high blood pressure medications make them have erectile dysfunction, if your medications give you serious side effects, you may want to try nature. As a reminder, these herbs can go through decoction (boiling).They can be infused (Pour hot water on them). Some can be squeezed to get their juice out. A teacup in the morning and night is perfect. I read about someone who had serious itching all over her body after taking cloves (kanafuru). If you are allergic to any of the herbs, discontinue the usage. I will never discourage you from seeing your doctor. What I do every week is to build a bridge between medical science and herbal medicine.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Nnaji who spoke on the extent of work done at the site, disclosed that the water scheme which involves the conversion of 13 industrial boreholes to solar power to ensure availability and sustainability of water reticulation to Enugu metropolis \u201cis over 90 percent completed\u201d.\n\nIt would be recalled that Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration in its sheer determination to decisively address water challenges in the state recently awarded contract to FordMarx Nigeria Limited for comprehensive rehabilitation of the 9th Mile Crash Programme which was abandoned after the administration of former Governor Jim Nwobodo of old Anambra State.\n\nEach of the rehabilitated boreholes is solar powered, to address the peculiar challenges of power failure.\n\nThe project was conceptualized by Gov.

The project has a two-year warranty and maintenance by the company.\n\nSpeaking further, the Managing Director of FordMarx Nigeria Limited stated that \u201cwe are getting more than what we expected in terms of the quality of water and soonest we will be rounding up\u201d.\n\nEngr. Nnaji assured that \u201cwater will be available at an affordable rate and also sustainable because the rehabilitated boreholes are powered by solar as we will not wait for the grid electricity or diesel powered generator to pump water\u201d.\n\nHe revealed that after servicing the 13 boreholes they discovered at the site, eight of them are now in good working condition stressing: \u201cThere is enough water and we have seen more that what we expected\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe borehole can sustain more than the size of the pump we proposed initially. The borehole can sustain more than 100 horsepower pump. We had expected something about 500 cubic meters per day from a hole, but now we are getting more than double of what we expected\u201d.\n\nThe contractor who listed other ongoing projects at the site such as perimeter fencing of 250 plots of land covering the facility, severe gully erosion control of about 15 meters depth and a security tower with CCTV cameras, commended Gov.

          "text": "Business magnate and investor, Mr. Femi Otedola, has acquired a material shareholding in Nigeria\u2019s oldest banking group, FBN Holdings (FBNH) Plc.\n\nOtedola in a series of secondary market transactions and negotiated deals was confirmed to have acquired more than five per cent equity stake in FBN Holdings, the parent holding company for First Bank of Nigeria (FBN) and its former subsidiaries\n\nNigerian capital market rules set a threshold of five per cent for \u201cmaterial\u201d or significant shareholding, which must be disclosed to the regulatory authorities and the board of the affected company.\n\nSources in the know and dealers at the stock market confirmed that Otedola might have acquired more than two billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in FBNH in a series of secondary transactions that heightened with a major cross deal two weeks ago.\n\nFBNH, one of the companies with the widest and diverse shareholding base, has total issued share capital of 35.895 billion ordinary shares of 50 kobo each.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn one of the transactions, Otedola was believed to be the proxy buyer in a N7.57 billion cross deal at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited on October 07, 2021. A total of 473 million shares of FBNH were crossed at N16 per share, significantly above the market price. The transaction was registered as a \u201cnegotiated cross deal\u201d by FBNQuest Securities Limited, implying that the deal was already concluded between the parties and was merely taken to the market to formalise the transaction.\n\nA Marina, Lagos-based stockbroking firm also confirmed to The Nation that it sold several millions of shares to Otedola in multiple secondary market transactions, deals that popped up the firm and FBN Holdings as largest dealer and most active stock in recent days.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSome of the deals included shares held by an estranged long-standing director of the group, who lost a major boardroom squabble recently and under regulatory review.\n\nRead Also: Stock Exchange to review rules to attract more foreign investors\n\nBut all market pundits were unanimous that the aggressive acquisitions by Otedola would not lead to any material changes in the board and management of the banking group. They noted that Otedola\u2019s holding falls short of majority shareholding as the traditional alliance that runs the banking group still has controlling equity stakes.\n\nWith no outstanding majority shareholder, FBNH has been run by a longstanding, time-tested traditional alliance of several shareholders with major shareholdings who traditionally pool their holdings through proxies to sway major decisions including board and management appointments. That alliance was tested recently during a boardroom squabble and it fended off what was described as \u201cundue\u201d influence.\n\nLatest audit showed that while no individual shareholders held more than five per cent equity stake, some 40 shareholders held more than 30 per cent equity stakes, in an informal alliance that uniquely sustains the diversity of the banking group, despite emergence of core majority shareholders in other first generation banks.\n\nChecks with the regulators indicated that Otedola has not formally filed required disclosure to initiate the market of his shareholdings status at the FBNH\n\nA source at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) said the regulator was still engaging the parties and reviewing details of transactions. Another source said the regulators were reviewing timelines and thresholds of transactions to ensure that the acquisition complied with extant regulations that require disclosure of material acquisition within a specific timeline.\n\nMarket pundits said the acquisitions by Otedola would possibly lead to no changes in the FBNH citing corporate governance structure at the banking group, diverse shareholding and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s regulations. As against other non-financial institutions, CBN reserves the primary approval right for any appointment unto the board and management of a regulated financial institution.\n\n\u201cThis is not like the case of Forte Oil, he was practically the owner of Forte Oil but he is not holding the majority shares in FBNH, and I don\u2019t think he has the financial muscle to attain a clear single controlling equity stake,\u201d a source, who is a dealer and chief executive at the stock market, said.\n\nWhile the board of the FBNH has not issued any official statement, a source close to the directors said there was no indication of any takeover, allaying fears of any possible major changes in the board and management of the group.\n\nOtedola\u2019s current shareholding falls short of the regulatory requirement for a tender offer, which could have allowed the business magnate to make exclusive sweetened offer to the general investing public.\n\nSection 131, Part XII of the Investment and Securities Act, No. 29, 2007 and Rule 445 of SEC Rules and Regulations, 2013 make it mandatory for any institution or person that acquires at least 30 per cent of a company to make an mandatory tender offer (MTO) to other minority shareholders. There are however exemptions in few instances.\n\nOtedola had in June 2019 sold its majority shareholding in the then Forte Oil Plc in a deal valued at about N64 billion. Ignite Investments and Commodities Limited led by Prudent Energy Services Limited had in June 2019 completed the acquisition of 74.02 per cent majority equity stake in Forte Oil from the company\u2019s erstwhile chairman, Otedola.\n\nThe new core investor then appointed a six-man board to replace the eight-man board led by the erstwhile chairman and majority core investor, Otedola. Mr Abdulwasiu Sowami replaced Otedola as the chairman of the board of directors of the company while Mr Olumide Adeosun replaced Mr Akin Akinfemiwa as the chief executive officer. Sowami is the chairman of Ignite Investments and Commodities Limited and founder and chief executive officer of Prudent Energy Services Limited.\n\nOtedola had in December 2018 in a dramatic twist announced plan to sell his 75 per cent majority equity stake in Forte Oil to Prudent Energy, which was investing through Ignite Investments and Commodities Limited. Prior to this announcement, Otedola-led board had secured major approvals on a long-term growth and financing plans for the energy group.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja and oluseye ojo, ibadan\n\nThe Federal Government has made some damning allegations against leader of Yoruba Nation agitation, Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) and the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB(, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nWhile the government said some countries are aiding Kanu in his subversive activities to destabilize the country, it accused Igboho of being sponsored by a lawmaker and having links with a group accused of financing Boko Haram.\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, who made the allegation on Friday disclosed that some state actors aided Kanu after he escaped from the country.\n\nMalami also accused an unnamed sitting federal lawmaker and others of being the major financiers of the Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho).\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing held in his office, Malami said, \u201cWe have also established that Kanu is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSome of the state actors aided Kanu, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\n\u201cWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by Kanu and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people. Conversely, there are some friendly countries which, recognising the status of IPOB as a terrorist organization, have either banned the activities of IPOB or placed Kanu on Stop List.\n\n\u201cTo these peace loving countries that have put Kanu on their Stop Lists and banned IPOB from operating in their territories, we express our appreciation\u201d, Malami stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential adhoc Committee Investigating the activities of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has indicted Kanu of instigating violence leading to killings and destructive activities in the South East. AGF disclosed that President Buhari had, after Kanu was re-arrested in June, inaugurated a Presidential Ad-hoc Committee to investigate activities of the IPOB. He said that 24 members of the committee were drawn from the Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Federal Ministry of Information (MoI), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).\n\nAccording to him, the outcome of an investigation that was conducted by the committee, revealed that the IPOB and the Eastern Security Network, ESN, have so far, killed 175 security personnel comprising 128 policemen, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives. He said the investigation further revealed that Kanu\u2019s broadcasts fuelled the #EndSARS protests that led to the destruction of public facilities, including the attack on the Oba of Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhile in self-exile, Nnamdi Kanu intensified his subversive campaign, using online Radio Biafra to instigate violence and incite members of IPOB to commit violent attacks against civil and democratic institutions, particularly the security personnel, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and civilians.\n\n\u201cHe instigated the destruction of public and private properties across the country. As a result of these criminal activities, IPOB was proscribed and designated a terrorist organization by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in an Order made on 20th September 2017. The AGF also the Federal Government has received the report on the financers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho). The report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on 23rd April, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as Directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in nine banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatist was found to be a Federal lawmaker in the National Assembly. A total sum of NI27, 145,000.00 was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N273,198,200.00 transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11th March, 2021. Investigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of N12, 750,000 to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\n\u201cIt might be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Umar Usman are suspects in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation. Abdullahi Umar Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to SURAJO ABUBAKAR MUHAMMAD (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism (Boko Haram).\n\n\u201cThis report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country. The report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\n\nHaving received the reports, the Federal Government remains solute in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria. The Federal Government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is giving the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nMeanwhile lawyer to Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, has faulted the claims by the Federal Government, insisting that the Yoruba Nation agitator is a businessman, not a terrorist.\n\nThe lead counsel to Igboho, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), in his reaction, said apart from being a businessman selling cars, Igboho is also a campaigner for self-determination.\n\nAlliyu, in a press statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Friday, said: \u201cSunday was alleged to have transferred the sum of N12.7million to Abbal Bako & Sons, owned by Abdullahi Umar. Transferring money to bureau de change to buy dollars is what is done by every businessman of our client\u2019s calibre. Thank God that his passports and various bills of ladings were carted away by DSS during the ungodly invasion of 1st July, 2021.\n\n\u201cThus, so far, there is no evidence of receipt of money from Abbal Bako & Sons or Abdullahi Umar going by the press conference. What the Hon AGF stated are mere conjectures. Not hard fact. Our client, according to him, paid Umar and not vice versa, thus belying what the Honourable Attorney General of Federation earlier said that Chief Sunday Adeyemo is being financed by people. The picture the learned AGF wanted to paint is that our client is being financed by Abdullah Umar, allegedly involved in terrorists financing. Who is now financing who?\n\n\u201cAgain, Chief Adeyemo is a car dealer, trading in the name of Adesun International Concept Ltd. Does it mean that anybody buying car from him or selling car to him is a terrorist? Chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Igboho Oosa was not into Oodua Nation until last year.\n\nSo, finding over N273million turnover between October 2013 and September 2020 shows that he was not a poor man. His house invaded by DSS on 1st July 2020 is worth over N2billion!\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "By Sunday Ani And Job Osazuwa\n\nSaturday, October 16, was a special day in the annals of media events in Nigeria. It was a day The Sun Publishing Limited held its 18th edition of the annual The Sun Awards. The ceremony, which has unarguably become the biggest media event in Africa, honoured 24 outstanding Nigerians, for remarkably distinguishing themselves in their various fields of endeavours.\n\nThe event has come and gone, but its echoes still resonate, as millions of Nigerians within and outside the country that followed the live broadcast of the event on three national television stations keep talking about it. On that special day, the Expo Hall of Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, venue of the prestigious award, was filled to the brim, with guests from all walks of life.\n\nIt was the gathering of the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the Nigerian society, with state governors, state and federal legislators, politicians across party lines, captains of industry, business moguls, entertainment gurus and academics, among others all in attendance. The paraphernalia of some state governments were literally moved to the award venue, underscoring the importance of Africa\u2019s biggest media event. The Edo and Ondo State Government Houses were virtually relocated to the Eko Hotel venue of the event as the two state governors, their deputies, their chiefs of staff, their commissioners, and their state legislators, local government chairmen and other top government functionaries from both states were physically present at the event. Guests, elegantly and magnificently attired, were carefully ushered into the elaborate hall. Radiating beauty, panache, fun and elegance, they were skilfully arranged around tens of big round tables exquisitely draped with alluring white and red wraps of clothes, and bouquets of flowers, each table tempting and inviting. On the tables were also various kinds of drinks ranging from assorted wines and alcoholic beverages, juice, malt, mineral water and cans of table water as well as wine glasses.\n\nThe illumination that intermittently filled the stage marvelled all. The shining objects shone with gleam and constantly changed from bright to dim lights. A look up to the roof dazzled one with magnificent lights in diverse sizes and shapes that twinkled like a galaxy of stars; it was indeed a beauty to behold. The stage was just on fire, radiating everything about the beauty of The Sun as the Voice of the Nation.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe array of automobiles ranging from the latest sports cars to SUVs that flooded the car garage was a pointer to the fact that an unusual event was taking place at the ever busy hotel. The managers of the facility certainly had a hectic day attending to the guests who had started trickling in as early as 3pm.\n\nIt was indeed a night of glitz, glamour and honour. Though it was a night event, The Sun shone irresistibly while the occasion lasted.\n\nThe Sun Awards has been held consistently for the past 18 years, except last year when it was virtually hosted due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which disrupted the activities of mankind in all ramifications. But, even with the pandemic which literally halted almost all economic, political, religious and social events, not only in Nigeria but also all over the globe, The Sun Awards remained unstoppable. A virtual brand, which was the first of its kind in Nigeria, still held to the amazement of doubting Thomases. The almighty COVID-19 and its attendant ill winds were demystified. The Sun defied the deadly scourge and shone brightly.\n\nThe lovely evening started with a red carpet event, which commenced about 6pm, as eminent personalities and celebrities continued to troop to the Expo Hall of Eko Hotels for nthe night of glitz and glamour.\n\nA gale of commendations\n\nThose who have been keenly following the annual event all agreed that the choice of the magnificent hall suggests the size and stature of the event, which they also acknowledged has continued to be improved upon with every passing edition. They also agreed that with every edition, The Sun sets novel and higher standards for other media houses to emulate.\n\nFounder of a non-governmental organisation, David Folaranmi Foundation, Mr. David Folaranmi, described the massive turnout at the event as a pointer to the fact that the hundreds of thousands of Nigerians have come to the realization that it is indeed the biggest media event, not only in Nigeria but also in Africa.\n\n\u201cI am pleased with the awardees,\u201d he intoned. \u201cA careful look at their profiles and antecedents reveals that they deserved the honour bestowed on them.\u201d\n\nAlso rating the award, another guest, Abubakar Danladi, who was in the entourage of the governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje; confessed that the decoration, particularly the aesthetic touch on the pathway to the hall was second to none.\n\n\u201cI have been watching the past Sun Awards on television and I have always admired it. This is my first time to participate and my respect for The Sun has increased. From what I have seen so far, it shows that no other awards can beat The Sun,\u201d he said.\n\nSetting the tone of the event was the Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief of the Sun Publishing Limited, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh. He noted that the event was a celebration of Nigerians who, despite COVID-19, excelled when success looked impossible. They blazed the trail and stood to be counted last year.\n\n\u201cTheir achievements tell the story of the true Nigerian spirit of fighting for success, even in difficult situations. The 24 award winners are made of sterner stuff. They are resourceful, dogged, resilient, strategic and focused. They could pass for conquerors of COVID-19, having excelled in their respective endeavours at a difficult time,\u201d he stated.\n\nMaintaining that the award remains the biggest media event in Nigeria and Africa, Ukeh noted that like a mustard seed, it has continued to grow 18 years after its debut. He commended the awardees for applying winning strategies and recording outstanding successes despite the effect of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFrom the list, we can see that the award winners cut across all sectors; all strata of the society. They did well in governance, public service, entrepreneurship, entertainment, hospitality, industrialisation, philanthropy and humanity.

          "text": "Links Igboho to Boko Haram\u2019s sponsor\n\nMay pardon Saro-Wiwa, 8 others as part of Ogoni\u2019s integration\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday blamed the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, who is on trial for treason, for the murder of Chike Akunyili, the husband of the late Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof. Dora Akunyili.\n\nThe government also said it had established a link between Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, and a Boko Haram sponsor, Surajo Muhammad, who was jailed in the United Arab Emirates on charges of financing terrorism.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), made these allegations yesterday while unveiling the findings of a Presidential Committee set up to investigate Kanu and Ighoho.\n\nThe 24-member committee, headed by Malami, had representatives from the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Federal Ministry of Information, the Nigeria Police Force, the Department of State Services, the National Intelligence Agency and the Defence Intelligence Agency.\n\nThe government further accused Kanu of being responsible for the murder of a former Presidential Aide, Ahmad Gulak, and over 177 others in the South-East.\n\nThe committee said consequent upon the instigating directives of Kanu, members of IPOB and the Eastern Security Network carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions, especially facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u201cwith a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt said the attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 led to the killing of 175 security personnel.\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cActing on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\n\u201cThat on October 21, 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill government security forces, which was carried out, and security personnel (especially police officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\n\u201cThat 175 security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising 128 policemen, 37 military personnel and 10 other security operatives.\n\n\u201cRecently, there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. AnayochukwuDurueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community, as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others, as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on May 30, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe committee found out that as a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were 19 attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices and burning of 18 INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo states.\n\nThe Presidential Committee stated that 164 police stations and formations, including police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN, leading to the death of 128 policemen while 144 were injured and 628 vehicles were destroyed.\n\nIt said 396 firearms and 17,738 ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks.\n\n\u201cThat there were three IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service, including the Headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where 1,841 inmates escaped; that the Headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one officer,\u201d the report read.\n\nLinks Igboho to Boko Haram\u2019s Sponsor\n\nThe Committee also claimed to have established a link between Igboho, and the convicted Boko Haram sponsor, Surajo Muhammad.\n\nGovernment further alleged that between 2013 and 2020, Igboho received N127 million from several financiers, including a federal lawmaker. The government refused to reveal the identity of the lawmaker.\n\nMalami said, \u201cThe report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on April 23, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in nine banks.\n\n\u201cThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a federal lawmaker in the National Assembly. A total sum of N127,145,000 was received by Igboho from his financiers between October 22, 2013, and September 28, 2020, through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\n\u201cA total sum of N273,198,200 transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between March 15, 2013, and March 11, 2021. Investigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of N12,750,000 to Abbal Bako & Sons.\u201d\n\nThe AGF noted that Abbal Bako and Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Usman, \u201care suspects\u201d in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation.\n\n\u201cAbdullahi Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to Surajo Abubakar Muhammad (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism (Boko Haram). This report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country,\u201d Malami said.\n\nMalami stated that having received the reports, the federal government \u201cremains solute\u201d in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe federal government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is given the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari: FG May Pardon Ken Saro-Wiwa, 8 Others\n\nThe killing of Ogoni activist and renowned playwright, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others (Ogoni 9) in November, 1995 during the Abacha administration reechoed yesterday as President Buhari disclosed that the federal government might consider granting pardon to the Ogoni 9 as part of moves to genuinely integrate the Ogoni people.\n\nThis is just as President Buhari urged Ogoni leaders to sensitise their people on why they must value protection of pipelines and national assets in their area.\n\nThe President spoke while playing host to Ogoni leaders, led by Gbenemene Tai and President of the Supreme Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers, His Majesty King Godwin N.K. Giniwa at the State House, Abuja.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring clemency and national integration as part of this Administration\u2019s bid to lay the foundation for genuine reconciliation and bring closure to the issues of Ogoni Land.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate incidents of the early 1990s leading to the loss of lives of distinguished sons of Ogoni Land and the collateral judicial processes are indelible in our memories.\n\n\u201cDespite the grievous circumstances, the federal government will consider the request for the grant of pardon to finally close the Ogoni saga.\u201d\n\nRecall that Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others were accused of killing four fellow Ogonis, leading to their arrest and trial by a military tribunal which found them guilty and accordingly sentenced them to death by hanging.\n\nKen Saro-Wiwa along with eight others namely Saturday Dobee, NorduEawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, BariborBera, BarinemKiobel, and John Kpuine, were executed by hanging on November 10, 1995 and buried in Port Harcourt Cemetery in Rivers State capital.\n\nHe said the government would bring to a close all pending issues on sons of Ogoni Land.\n\n\u201cYour Royal Highnesses, distinguished representatives of the people of Ogoni Land, I note the need to ensure completion of segment of the East-West road traversing Ogoni Land, and steps will be taken to ensure delivery under the Infrastructure Development Fund as earlier conceived. We intend to complete this vital artery of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Ltd (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), had been granted license to operate OML11, which will stimulate economic activities and integration in the zone.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, NNPC is hereby directed to engage all host communities, particularly Ogoni people to ensure inclusive processing of oil and gas, anchored on optimum involvement of host communities. NPDC will lay a broad-based programme for the emergence of a new Ogoni Land for the benefit of the Ogoni people and Nigeria as a whole,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, King Godwin N.K. Giniwa, thanked President Buhari for various interventions in the area, particularly on clean-up of the environment.\n\nThe paramount ruler noted that the people believe in the unity of Nigeria and the future of every group could only be guaranteed in one nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe October 30 and 31 national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is now threatened as lawyer to the suspended national chairman of party, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), has written a letter to the principal officers of the party as well as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) to stop the planned convention as there was a pending appeal against the convention in the Court of Appeal.\n\nIn a letter by Oyetibo dated October 21, 2021, addressed to the following officers of the party: The PDP Acting National Chairman, the Chairman, PDP National Convention Committee, the PDP National Organising Secretary, the PDP National Legal Adviser and the PDP National Secretary C/O Chief E.O Oddey, Odey and Odey Solicitors of above address Suite 120-122 Pan Bank Building No. 2 Forces Avenue, Old GRA Port Harcourt.\n\nOyetibo said that CA/PH/341/2021: Prince Uche Secondus V Ibeawuchi E. Alex & ORS and the pendency of the application for injunction to restrain the holding of the national convention.\n\n\u201cWe act for the Appellant in the above captioned matter, Prince Uche Secondus, who was the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), prior to the institution of Suit Number PHC/218 3/CS/202I, and wish to bring to your attention the following facts:\n\n\u201cOn 23 August 2021 one Mr. lbeawuchi E. Alex and four others jointly instituted Suit No PHC/2183 /CS/202I at the High Court of Rivers State, Port Harcourt Judicial Division against Prince Uche Secondus and the PDP as Defendants.\n\n\u201cOn I0 September 2021, the High Court of Rivers State delivered its judgment in the suit whereby Prince Uche Secondus was, inter alia, restrained from performing the functions of the office of National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n\u201cAn appeal has been filed and entered against the judgment at the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Judicial Division.\n\nIn addition, an Application on Notice has been filed in which Prince Uche Secondus is seeking, inter alia, the following orders,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nAccording to Secondus\u2019s lawyer, \u201cAn Order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6 Respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nOyetibo said that alternative to above that \u201cAn Order that the parties to this appeal, particularly the Appellant /Applicant and the 6th Respondent (Peoples Democratic Party) shall maintain the status quo ante as at 22 August 2021, when Appellant/Applicant was occupying the office of National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\n\n\u201cThe application has since been served on you and other Respondents in the appeal.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the service of the Application for injunction, it has come to the Notice of our client that the PDP and its officers continue to prepare to hold the National Convention on 30 and 3 I October 2021,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to Oyetiba, \u201cThis letter is intended to draw your attention to the position of the law of Nigeria on this subject as encapsulated in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the celebrated case of Governor of Lagos State vs. Chief Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu (1 986) I NWLR (Part 18) 621 @ 637, in which the court, reviewed various decisions on the point, and approved the following principles as the correct position of the law, that is:\n\n\u201cThe rule is well settled \u2026 .. .. that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain activities of which the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending a hearing and determination even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued .. .. . ..\n\n\u201cThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him even though a temporary injunction be not granted, he acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status wholly irrespective of the merit s as they may be ultimately decided.\u201d\n\nHe explained in the letter that the same position was taken by the Court of Appeal in Chief Elias Okeke-Oba vs. Ikwuka Okoye (1994) 8 NWLR (364) 605 @ 617- 61 8, where the court said as follows:\n\n\u201cThe general practice is that on application for an order for interlocutory injunction, all activities affecting the res, are automatically terminated as a mark of respect to the court before whom the application is pending\u2026. if\u2026 parties to the suit senselessly rush their tortious trespassory activities\u2026 in the spacious belief that that would promote their unfounded claims to the res. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Such heedless posture is, to say the least, a fragrant disrespect to the court. It clearly, in my opinion, amounts to intransigence for a party against whom an order for injunction is sought to intensify his interference with the rest\u2026 The court cannot be hoodwinked by such impropriety of unlawful acts in relation to the rest nor can the person in such disrespect be allowed to take advantage of his default and flagrant intransigence.\u201d\n\nHe said that the logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts was that having been served with an application seeking to restrain the holding of its National Convention pending the determination of the appeal filed by Prince Uche Secondus, the PDP would be embarking upon a collision course with the court if it proceeds to hold the National Convention before the hearing and determination of the Application.\n\n\u201cShould such contumacious conduct of holding the National Convention before the hearing and determination of the Application be embarked upon by the party however, we shall not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law against all national officers of the party that are responsible for such conduct of contempt of court.\n\n\u201cQuite apart from the fact that such contumacious conduct would impinge on the integrity of the party, we would on our part, swiftly take steps to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to nullify any decision, action or step taken at such Convention,\u201d Secondus lawyer said.\n\nIn view of his letter, Oyetiba said, \u201cWe trust that you will wisely advise the Peoples Democratic Party and its officers in this regard. Yours faithfully, Tayo Oyetibo, SAN, FCIArb, FNIALS.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that the suit is billed for judgement on Tuesday next week.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press, I welcome you to this very important press conference.\n\nAs you are aware Nnamdi Kanu, the self-acclaimed leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been at the center of a subversive campaign against the Nigerian State. Consequently, Nnamdi Kanu was arrested on 14th October, 2015. He was charged to court for treasonable felony, among other crimes. He was granted bail by the Federal High Court, Abuja on 25th April 2017. He however breached the bail conditions and fled abroad.\n\nWhile in self-exile, Nnamdi Kanu intensified his subversive campaign, using online Radio Biafra to instigate violence and incite members of IPOB to commit violent attacks against civil and democratic institutions, particularly the security personnel, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and civilians. He instigated the destruction of public and private properties across the country.\n\nAs a result of these criminal activities, IPOB was proscribed and designated a terrorist organization by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, in an Order made on 20th September 2017.\n\nDespite the proscription of IPOB by the Federal Government, Nnamdi Kanu continued the subversive campaign, instigating and inciting broadcasts to direct members of the IPOB to launch attacks on government.\n\nThe EndSARS protests of October 2020 played into the sinister plans of Nnamdi Kanu, whereby he seized the protests through subversive and inciting online broadcasts and actively commanded and directed attacks on security personnel and facilities.\n\nAs a result of these broadcasts, members of IPOB attacked and killed security personnel and burnt down Police stations, Correctional centers, INEC offices, bus terminals, the Palace of Oba of Lagos, Banks, hospitals, shopping malls and vehicles, amongst others.\n\nOn 12th December, 2020, Eastern Security Network\u201d (ESN) was formed by Nnamdi Kanu as an armed wing of IPOB with the mandate to advance the nefarious agenda of the outlawed group. ESN continued to launch attacks on security personnel, civilians perceived as enemies as well as destruction of private and public properties.\n\nThe destructive activities of IPOB/ESN pose serious threat to Nigeria\u2019s National Security and its corporate existence, which resulted into re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu and members of his group.\n\nThe eventual re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu in June 2021, and some members of his group led to the inauguration of a Presidential Ad-hoc Committee, comprising twenty-four (24) members drawn from:\n\n1. Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ),\n\n2. Federal Ministry of Information (MoI),\n\n3. Nigeria Police Force (NPF),\n\n4. Department of State Services (DSS),\n\n5. National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and\n\n6. Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA),\n\nThe Committee, inaugurated by the President, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR), was headed by the Honorable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Committee finds as a fact, that consequent upon the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, members of IPOB/ESN carried out massive attacks on democratic institutions especially INEC Facilities with a view to hampering democratic process in Nigeria. These attacks that were carried out between October 2020 and June 2021 include the following:\n\nI. That acting on the instigating directives of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB members and #EndSARS protesters attacked and killed many security agents, destroyed several public and private properties, including Police stations, public transport buses and other facilities across the country.\n\nII. That on 21st October 2020, Nnamdi Kanu through an online call-in radio programme (Radio Biafra), further instigated IPOB members to burn down all police stations and kill Government security forces, which was carried out and several Security personnel (especially Police Officers) were killed and public and private properties destroyed.\n\nIII. One hundred and seventy-five (175) security personnel were killed by IPOB/ESN, comprising one hundred and twenty eight (128) Police men, thirty seven (37) military personnel and ten (10) other security operatives;\n\nIV. Killing of prominent Nigerians, (recently there were gruesome killings of traditional leaders: Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. Anayochukwu Durueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community as well as the killings of Dr. Chike Akunyili and eight others as well as the killing of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak on 30th May. 2021);\n\nV. That as a consequence of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s broadcasts, there were nineteen (19) attacks on INEC facilities that resulted in the destruction of offices as well as burning of eighteen (18) INEC logistical vehicles, several election materials, equipment and ICT gadgets in Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Cross River, Enugu, Ebonyi and Imo States;\n\nVI. That one hundred and sixty-four (164) police stations and formations, including Police Headquarters, Owerri, Imo State were attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one hundred and twenty-eight (128) police men {as stated in III above}; one hundred forty four (144) injured while six hundred twenty eight (628) vehicles were destroyed.\n\nVII. That three hundred and ninety-six (396) firearms and seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty eight (17,738) ammunition were carted away during the IPOB/ESN attacks;\n\nVIII. That there were three (3) IPOB/ESN attacks on Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), including the Headquarters of NCoS, Owerri, Imo State where one thousand eight hundred and forty one (1,841) inmates escaped;\n\nIX. That the Headquarters of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Umuahia, Abia State was also attacked by IPOB/ESN leading to the death of one (1) officer;\n\nX. That there were several IPOB/ESN attacks and destruction (arson) of public and private properties during the EndSARS and Biafra agitations across the country, especially in the South-East and South-South regions, notably the Palace of the Oba of Lagos where twelve\n\n(12) flats were completely looted and vandalized, the country home of the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, was burnt, over one hundred and fifty (150) buses burnt at the Lagos Bus Terminal, Sen. Ndoma Egba\u2019s home in Calabar Municipal, Cross River State, was completely looted and vandalized, Lagos State DNA and Forensic Centre, City Hall Race Course, First Bank Branch Lagos, Lagos State Public Works Commission, Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), Marina, Lagos, High Court Igbosere, Lagos, were all burnt, amongst other heinous crimes committed.\n\nWe have also established that KANU is not alone in his subversive activities. He has accomplices in Nigeria and abroad, individuals and groups as well as state and non-state actors who are aiding and facilitating his campaign against the people and state of Nigeria. Some of the state actors aided KANU, even as a fugitive, in his destructive mission, ignoring the terrorist nature of his activities.\n\nWe call on these countries to desist from aiding subversive acts by KANU and IPOB against the state of Nigeria and its people. Conversely, there are some friendly countries which, recognising the status of IPOB as a terrorist organization, have either banned the activities of IPOB or placed KANU on Stop List. To these peace loving countries that have put KANU on their Stop Lists and banned IPOB from operating in their territories, we express our appreciation.\n\nSimilarly, the Federal Government has received the report on financers of Adeniyi Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho. The report revealed that Sunday Igboho is a Director and signatory to Adesun International Concept Limited registered on 23rd April, 2010. Adesun International Concept Limited also has Oladele Oyetunji and Aderopo Adeyemo as Directors. Sunday Igboho is linked to 43 bank accounts in 9 banks.\n\nThe major financier of the fugitive and separatists was found to be a Federal Law Maker in the National Assembly. A total sum of ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION, ONE AND FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND NAIRA ONLY (N127, 145,000.00) was received by Igboho from his financiers between 22nd October, 2013 and 28th September, 2020 through Adesun International Concept Ltd accounts.\n\nA total sum of TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THREE MILLION, ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT THOUSAND, TWO HUNDRED NAIRA ONLY (N273,198,200.00) transaction outflows was recorded from Sunday Igboho\u2019s account between 15th March, 2013 and 11 the March, 2021.\n\nInvestigation reveals that Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) transferred the sum of twelve million seven hundred and fifty thousand naira (N12, 750,000) to Abbal Bako & Sons.\n\nIt might be recalled that Abbal Bako & Sons and its promoter Abdullahi Umar Usman are suspects in the on-going Joint Terrorist Financing Investigation. Abdullahi Umar Usman is by way of financial transaction connected to SURAJO ABUBAKAR MUHAMMAD (who was sentenced to life imprisonment in UAE on charges of financing terrorism [Boko Haram]).\n\nThis report shows the nexus between separatists\u2019 agitation, terrorism financing and disruptions of peace in the country.\n\nThe report found connections of financial transaction between Adesun International Concept Ltd (belonging to Igboho) and some construction companies and businesses among others.\n\nHaving received the reports, the Federal Government remains solute in its determination to have a peaceful Nigeria. The Federal Government will do the needful, within the context of the legal provisions, in ensuring that the matter is giving the deserved attention and those found guilty will be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nI thank you most sincerely.\n\nAbubakar Malami, SAN Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former Kogi West Senator in the eighth National Assembly, Dino Melaye, graduated with Second Class Lower Division and grappled with several \u201ccarry-overs\u201d while studying Law at the Baze University in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nA carry-over is a common tertiary institution slang used in Nigeria for students who have to repeat a course after failing it the first time.\n\nSaharaReporters obtained the Baze University convocation booklet which showed, contrary to trending reports that Melaye finished top of his class, that the senator finished with a second class division degree.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that Melaye, with Matriculation Number, BU/18B/LAW/3226, also had \"carry-overs\" during his degree.\n\n\u201cContrary to trending stories that Dino graduated on top of his class with a First Class Degree, he never did and actually had several carry-overs for the period he studied law at Baze.

          "text": "A Benue State-based businessman, Sesugh Akume, has approached the National Judicial Council (NJC) to report two judges, W.I Kpochi and A. Ityonyiman, of the High Court of Justice in Benue State for their alleged breaches of the code of conduct for judiciary officers.\n\nAkume disclosed this in a press statement released on Friday, which he made available to SaharaReporters on Saturday.\n\nSesugh Akume\n\nHe argued that the justices in handling a case between him and the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, \u201ctake things personal and even insult, harass and intimidate litigants using their exalted positions.\u201d\n\nThe businessmen also noted that they gave contradictory rulings on March 17, 2021.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u201cCitizen Fights Back, Drags Two Benue Judges to NJC for Misconduct and Abuse of Privilege.\u201d\n\nIt partly read, \u201cThe Honourable Mr Justices W I Kpochi, and A Ityonyiman of the High Court of Justice of Benue State sitting in Makurdi, have today been dragged to the National Judicial Council (NJC) for their serial violations of the Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and contravening the rules of professional conduct for judges, misconduct and misbehaviour.\n\n\u201cIn the matter of Sesugh Akume and Governor of Benue & Others (MHC/182/2019, delivered on 21 July 2020) Justice Kpochi held that it was okay for governors to appoint local government caretaker administrations (as against having democratically-elected local government councils) contrary to the express provisions of the Constitution and Supreme Court judgements on the issue.\n\n\u201cHe also held that I did not have the locus standi (the right to sue) to bring up the matter to court when I approached it. Even though relying on the most recent Supreme Court authorities on locus standi which give me the right, the judge refused to be persuaded, however much my lawyers tried to convince him.\n\n\u201cJudges are to follow the law as it is written and what the superior courts say it is. Going contrary to Supreme Court judgements means a judge has gone rogue.\n\n\u201cIn the matter of Sesugh Akume and Governor of Benue & Another (MHC/293/2020, delivered on 17 March 2021) this same judge, among other things, cited sections of the Benue Local Government Law that are not so, in support of his judgement. What he claimed the referenced sections said is not what is written in the law at all.\n\n\u201cFurther to that he insulted me in the judgement, referring to the modest effort of seeking judicial interpretation of various sections of the Benue Local Government Law to attain local government autonomy and extricate that tier of government from the stranglehold of the emperor-governors, as a \u2018waste of time\u2019, and further called me a \u2018gold digger\u2019 in a matter that I made absolutely no monetary claims whatsoever, nor does the judge know me personally anywhere.\n\n\u201cJudges are to be respectable, dignified and courteous, they are not to descend into the arena, take things personal and even insult, harass and intimidate litigants using their exalted positions.\n\n\u201cIn the matter of Sesugh Akume v Government of Benue & Others (MHC/294/2021, delivered on 17 March 2021) Justice Ityonyiman held that I lacked the locus standi in a matter whereby I had made Freedom of Information (FOI) applications at the offices of the accountant-general of Benue, and chairman of Logo Local Government both of which were denied.\u201d\n\nAkume said it was unthinkable that he would lack the locus standi to seek redress in court regarding a letter he personally wrote and was denied his right to access a reply.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt has increasingly become a trend for judges to hide behind the issue of locus standi to side with the government and deny citizens justice, even when it is clear that it does not apply.\n\n\u201cThis same judge refused to answer the questions I brought before him, to wit, whether FOI applies to the state and local government system, etc. Judges are duty-bound to answer questions brought to them and not refuse to answer them at all ostensibly because a person lacks the locus standi.\n\n\u201cThese 2 judges (along with another) seem to have the unenviable reputation in the Benue judiciary of being pro-government, others insist. On that 17 March 2021, also both judges gave contradictory judgements on the issue of locus standi in the same day. Both cannot be right at the same time on this issue that has been resolved and now settled.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of the judiciary to assert itself as independent, impartial, fair, just, in order to inspire faith and confidence in it. When judgements are delivered it is not enough that justice is done, it is critical that justice is seen to be done.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, when a party is not satisfied with a judgement at the trial court they are to appeal at a superior court, which we have done. However, superior courts do not address issues of misbehaviour, misconduct, abuse of privilege, partiality, etc. Only the NJC does.\n\n\u201cIn my submission at the NJC today, I attached copies of the Benue Local Government Law, and the three judgments referred to above, as annexures for them to look at the issue dispassionately and determine it on its merit.\n\n\u201cAs a citizen, I have played my part and given the judiciary the opportunity to introspect, investigate this matter, and discipline the erring judges. They may choose to do the right thing or cover up. That will be entirely their call.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has countered an article by The Economist, which criticises the federal government on the security challenges in the country and describes \u201cmany\u201d soldiers as \u201cghosts\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe article, published earlier on Saturday, had made references to security agencies such as the army and the police, noting that the government needs to do more improve security.\n\n\u201cWhen violence erupts, the government does nothing or cracks heads almost indiscriminately. Nigeria\u2019s army is mighty on paper. But many of its soldiers are \u201cghosts\u201d who exist only on the payroll, and much of its equipment is stolen and sold to insurgents,\u201d the article reads.\n\n\u201cThe army is also stretched thin, having been deployed to all of Nigeria\u2019s states. The police are understaffed, demoralised and poorly trained. Many supplement their low pay by robbing the public they have sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe article, however, makes recommendations for improved security, adding that \u201cto stop the slide towards lawlessness, Nigeria\u2019s government should make its own forces obey the law\u201d.\n\nBut in a statement issued hours after the article was published, the army criticised the position of The Economist on the efforts of the military, describing it as a report done \u201cwithout due diligence\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven as the real intention of the otherwise respected Economist magazine in publishing such toxic concoctions weaved up as report on Nigerian Government\u2019s response to the multi-faceted security challenges assailing the country is yet to be unraveled, the source of the article is very clear. It is one of those deliberate falsehood and noxious narratives orchestrated by a network of detractors and coven of dark forces working very hard to adorn the Nigerian Army in an unfitting garb of infamy,\u201d a statement by Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesman, reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vile report which the Economist chose to offer its platform for publication, spared no effort in trying to vilify and rubbish the image, character and reputational standing of the Nigerian Army, but failed woefully.\n\n\u201cAs a professional, hard-fighting and globally respected institution that has continued to occupy deserved glorious position in the comity of global defence forces, the Nigerian Army is certainly not what the so-called report by the Economist tried to characterise it. Even more ludicrous was the embellishments of the said report by the notorious unprofessional media outlets that were quick to republish the obvious falsehood.\n\n\u201cHow is it conceivable that an international magazine worth its name and professional reputation would agree to lend its medium for a hatchet job of an article without as much as committing little effort to finding out the real truth about the Nigerian Army? How is it imaginable that the Nigerian Army that has distinguished itself as a worthy contributor to global peace and security through regional, continental and international peace keeping and peace support operations would be characterised as \u201cMighty on paper\u201d? How can the Nigerian Army that has restored democracies, brought peace to troubled lands and stabilised the sub-region through the dint of hard work, commitment to duty, discipline and professionalism be so denigrated?\n\n\u201cIs it the \u2018ghost soldiers\u2019 of the Nigerian Army that have weathered the storm of terrorism and insurgency of Boko Haram and Islamic State of West African Province Terrorists (ISWAP) in the north eastern part of the country and parts of the Lake Chad region?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn case the Economist magazine and those who fed it all the lies it published do not know, the Nigerian Army working in a joint environment, has been able to stop ISWAP, a very formidable international terrorist organisation in its tracks, in spite of all the obstacles, including arm sale blackouts on its way. The Economist and its ilk ought to have known that the Nigerian Army has long distinguished itself as a professional force that does not toy with accountability nor shirk from its statutory responsibility of defending Nigeria from external aggression or internal insurrection.\u201d\n\nThe army added that despite the content of the article, it remains \u201cundeterred, undistracted and totally unfazed by the harebrained assertions contained in that silly report\u201d.",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations.

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal.

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Technology is awesome, but it\u2019s yet to conquer stuttering",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I spoke with Charles Isidi \u2014 a growth marketing expert and digital media and marketing communications professional \u2014 over the phone, both of us stuttering to varying degrees as we discussed stuttering, words from a 2001 R&B song came back to me.\n\nWithout bogging you down with details, the chorus goes, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re lying, because when you\u2019re replying, stutter, stutters, stutter, stutters.\u201d\n\nLovers of R&B know that in the rest of the song, Joseph Lewis Thomas, known mononymously as Joe, suspected his partner was cheating on him. Yes, he smelt cologne. Yes, she didn\u2019t pick up when he called. But, his strongest point was that she stuttered when answering his questions about her whereabouts.\n\nAnd therein lies a major misconception: people stutter when they are lying. Twenty-one years later, the chorus of that song still forms the basis of many people\u2019s interactions with stutterers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with a slight stutter, I\u2019d be irked if people conclude I\u2019m fibbing because I can\u2019t get my words out coherently or quickly enough (for them). And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n\nSadly, being branded a liar because of a stutter is just one of the issues we stutterers face.\n\nStuttering in a tech-enabled world\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering. Stuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\n\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children. Treatment at any age seeks to improve speech fluency while simultaneously building the stutterer\u2019s confidence, thus helping them participate in school, work, and social settings.\n\nExpectedly, tech interventions exist, with many applications \u2014 Balbus Speech, Smarty Ears, and Stamurai (I like this name), to mention a few \u2014 for smartphones and tablets to help people with stuttering.\n\nStamurai, for instance, is a mobile app available on Google Play Store and the App Store. With the app, people learn and practice speech therapy exercises for stuttering. The best result they can get, however, is improved speech control.\n\nIn a world where social media is the go-to for content, many creators generate content from people\u2019s challenges for their jokes. Mildly put, this is insensitive and hurtful, and Charles strongly believes that people should be kinder to not only stutterers but everyone dealing with a disability.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer a paper on the International Stuttering Association website titled, Increasing Stuttering Awareness in Africa, 11% of children in Africa \u2014 nearly 6.5 million \u2014 of pre-school age (between 2 and 5 years of age) stutter. About 20% or 1.3 million of these children are at the risk of developing chronic stuttering in adult life, and approximately one million school-age children and over ten million adults stutter in Africa.\n\nScience trumps mythology\n\nAcross Africa, traditional beliefs about stuttering abound, varying from one location to the next.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, stuttering is believed to result from leaving a baby out in the rain, failing to inform ancestors of imminent childbirth, emotional trauma, and tickling a baby too much, among others.\n\nThe remedies for stuttering in these circles border on the hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nThankfully, science has provided clarity \u2014 for those ready to accept it \u2014 about the causes of stuttering.\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nFor some reason, stuttering is more common in boys than girls. Consequently, it tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys.\n\nOngoing research shows that people who stutter appear to process speech and language differently than those who don\u2019t. And while children with speech problems or developmental delays are more likely to stutter, strokes and traumatic brain injuries can also contribute to stuttering in adults.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to proceed without stating that proponents of traditional African ideologies about stuttering are right about emotional trauma having an impact; however, they\u2019d probably struggle to explain how. But science has shown that families with fast-paced lifestyles, high expectations, and emotional trauma often have stutterers.\n\nBeyond words; into the mind\n\nOther physical senses somewhat compensate for the loss of any sense, and so the blind, for instance, have keener senses of smell and hearing.\n\nPeople who struggle to speak often fill the vocal expression gap with writing, artwork, and other predominantly non-vocal forms of communication. Mostly, however, writing does it.\n\nFun fact: Isaac Newton stuttered throughout his life.\n\nFor Charles, who has stuttered for as long as he can remember, writing as early as seven has been a valuable alternative to sharing his experiences and documenting his thoughts.\n\nSpeaking about misconceptions he\u2019s had to deal with, he said, \u201cGrowing up in a country like Nigeria where people don\u2019t approach stuttering from a scientific point of view, you either get pity from people, or they assume you have anger issues.\u201d\n\nChioma, a recent mass communications graduate, shares Charles\u2019 thoughts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learnt over time that I\u2019m okay; there\u2019s nothing incredibly wrong with me.\u201d\n\nPutting it succinctly, Charles said, \u201cstutterers are simply audibly different from other people, and that shouldn\u2019t be an indictment on capability or anything else for that matter,\u201d and with the right support systems in place from people, workspaces, and other social touchpoints, they can control their stutters, but even more, feel safe to be someone who stutters.\n\n\u201cHaving understanding parents helped me a lot; they shielded me from people who had the worst to say about me. The support of my extended relatives was also a good thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnother misconception people have is that stutterers bottle things up and are impatient. So they are often encouraged to speak up.\n\nHolders of the belief that stutterers don\u2019t know what they want to say often complete their sentences for them, suggesting words and phrases that they think express the thoughts in the speakers\u2019 minds. Interestingly, they are not always right, and Charles couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents never completed my sentences; they were always patient enough for me to get my words out. But in my experience as an adult, people try to finish my sentences or, as they think they\u2019re doing, help me out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to do this because you\u2019re more or less saying \u2018I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re incapable of doing this on your own,\u2019 and that\u2019s not true. All that\u2019s required of listeners is a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nResearch by Leila Cherif and other members of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hedi Chaker Hospital and University of Sfax, Tunisia, shows that \u201cstuttering children (SC) are perceived negatively by peers and are rejected by peers more often than children who do not stutter. SC are often exposed to negative social experiences with both their peers and families such [as] teasing and bullying. These problems interfere negatively with self-esteem (SE) development and anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nConsequently, stutterers\u2019 personalities are shaped by their experiences and interactions with people wherever they go.\n\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself. It\u2019s hard to express my feelings, so, rather than talk, I write down my thoughts,\u201d Chioma submitted.\n\nBeing sensitive to the issues people face is a no-brainer, yes? Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t in some circles.\n\nA very Nigerian challenge is comedians joking about people\u2019s speech difficulties, such that rather than being given room for expression, they become the butt of jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the comedians; the audiences who find these jokes funny are the people with whom stutterers have to interact daily during their commutes, at work, at home, everywhere.\n\nRegardless of what they say, no one likes to be laughed at. So I was not surprised at how emphatically Chioma responded when asked if she would be open to trying out something to help with her stuttering.\n\n\u201cABSOLUTELY, I would like to speak without it looking like I have hot yam in my mouth.\u201d\n\nCharles, however, had different thoughts.\n\n\u201cA philosophy in support circles is do not do anything for anyone that they are capable of doing for themselves, it\u2019s a form of theft of people\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, having a speech defect is an important structure around which my life is built. I won\u2019t exactly say that taking that away is wrong. Stuttering or any disability adds to a person\u2019s humanity in a sense, and I don\u2019t know what kind of world we would have if we cannot feel the way others feel.\n\n\u201cTo take away a disability from someone who has likely lived this way all their lives is to level the playing field for them knowing that they didn\u2019t start the race at the same time. And I think that\u2019s unfair.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking it away with tech or medical intervention, I\u2019d rather create a world where people are kinder to those who function differently from how people typically act.\u201d\n\nInternational Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is a day set aside to raise awareness of the issues faced by millions of people who stutter or stammer. It is celebrated annually on October 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecious Mogoli Website I love love and a little peace and quiet.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
          "summary": "Stuttering in a tech-enabled worldOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering.\nStuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children.\nNumbers don\u2019t lieAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself.",

In 2021, over 1 million people registered to take the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams in Nigeria. This is a compulsory test that determines qualification for entrance into a Nigerian university. But, it continues.\n\nAfter JAMB, students undergo another test from their chosen universities. These processes are one-off. If they don\u2019t pass, most young people have to reapply the following year. Some schools have the direct entry option but with the same level of uncertainty\u2014the ones who can leave the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis cycle thrives because of low spending power, lack of options, and the tendency to acknowledge skill or relevance based on a university degree. This lack of degree options and the scarcity of developers is what TalentQL is looking to solve with AltSchool.\n\nFounded by Adewale Yusuf, Opeyemi Awoyemi, and Akintunde Sultan, TalentQL launched in November 2020 as a talent pipeline to connect developers with jobs. On Thursday, October 21, 2021, AltSchool was launched.\n\nWhat is AltSchool? It is a 9-month mentorship and upskilling program to train entry-level developers. Open to everyone above age 16, no technical background is required. Participants receive a diploma in Software Engineering and a three-month internship opportunity upon completion.\n\nThere\u2019s more: TalentQL launches AltSchool Africa to train entry level tech talent for free\n\nSo you care about your privacy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nUnder the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) 2019, all citizens have several rights over their personal data.

Small and medium enterprises in Nigeria, however, need even more applause.\n\nIn a country where everything from infrastructure to capital is a struggle, it takes a lot of grit, unusual strength, and patience to run a business.\n\nEnter BIZ301. With two decades of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) experience, Toyin Akintayo acutely understands this struggle. And with the help of his team, he decided to build BIZ301 to help entrepreneurs digitise small businesses operations.\n\nThink of a platform that manages expenses and budgets, invoices, employee and payroll management, helpdesk, and facility management applications. For as low as \u20a61000 a month, users can access all this on BIZ301.\n\nCurious?

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, Brass, a Nigerian digital bank, announced $1.7 million in funding to aid their growth across Africa. The raise saw participation from US-based early-stage investors, Hustle Funds, Acuity Ventures, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund.\n\nProminent ecosystem individuals like Flutterwave\u2019s Co-founder, Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, and Paystack\u2019s Co-founder, Ezra Olubi, also participated in this round.\n\nWhat does Brass do? Sola Akindolu, ex-Head of Products at Nigerian fintech, Kudi, and Emmanuel Okeke, ex-Engineering Manager at Paystack, launched Brass in July 2020 to provide SMEs with banking services and help business owners have control over their money operations.\n\nCurrently, the platform provides SMEs with various services, including payroll and expense management, credit and payment services, and API support.\n\nBrass has reportedly served thousands of businesses from schools to restaurants and malls, with a customer portfolio that includes platforms like Mono and Eden.\n\nThey claim to have disbursed $2 million in credit via their crediting platform, Brass Capital, which is still in the Beta phase.\n\nWhere are the funds going? With this raise, the startup is looking to scale and improve upon its products. Already, they have completed incorporation in Kenya and are looking to do the same in South Africa. By 2022, they want to launch in both countries fully.\n\nThe big picture is to develop innovative products that offer all-inclusive banking solutions in Africa.\n\nNeobanks spree? With the number of Business to Customers (B2C), and Business to Business (B2B) neobanks like PayHippo, Prospa, and Sparkle already offering similar services, one wonders what makes Brass different. Per TechCrunch, Akindolu shares that the company\u2019s focus is financial operations and cash flow support for SMEs.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nTechpoint Awards 2021: Nominate your favourite startups, influencers, and investors.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents. Through partnerships with over 40 banks and financial institutions in the country, customers can access funds in their accounts without using an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in a secure manner.\n\nWith 54 countries in Africa, providing financial services to users comes with lots of regulatory hurdles in each country. However, startups need to build services for users regardless. Usoro stated that being able to build solutions that allow for these differences could fix these challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the technology and fintech level, the ability for us to build an interoperable switch to allow multi-currencies, multi-wallets, to speak to each other seamlessly may be one of the things we need to do to fix that hurdle.\u201d\n\nSome may argue that there are too many players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector but with the scale of the problem, there might be a need for more players to throw their hats in the ring to solve some of the problems.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "There is a wave of excitement around three Nigerian startups that have hit a $1 billion valuation this year. They have become unicorns.\n\nIn business, a unicorn is a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was first popularised in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures.\n\nThese $1 billion companies, typically referred to as Unicorns include Flutterwave, Opay and Andela in fintech.\n\nThese tech startups have attracted massive funding from investors including angel, seed, as well as, early-stage and later-stage venture capitalists across the globe in the recent past.\n\nOpay\n\nOPay is a company that enables users to accomplish more with their money by providing smart financial services. It is a one-stop mobile-based platform for payment, transportation, food and grocery delivery, and other important services in everyday life.\n\nFounded by Yahui Zhou in June 2018, the startup has raised $570 million in funding over 3 rounds, with SoftBank Vision Fund as its lead investor and three others.

Additionally, the malware creates a backdoor which grants access to the user\u2019s device, thus enabling the invader or attacker to perform other criminal actions, including launching other variants of malware.\n\nIn view of this discovery and understanding of the process by which this malware operates, and in order to protect millions of telecom consumers and prevent criminal forces, irrespective of location, from using telecom platforms to perpetrate fraud and irredeemable damages, the NCC reiterate the advisory of ngCERT which includes:\n\n\u201cDo not click on the link if you receive a suspicious text message, and do not install any app or security update the page asks you to install, Use updated antivirus software that detects and prevents malware infections, Apply critical patches to the system and application, Use strong passwords and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) over logins, Back-up your data regularly, If you have been affected by this campaign, you should reset your device to factory mode as soon as possible. This will delete any data on your phone, including personal data,\n\nOther measures given by the commission are: \u201d Do not restore from backups created after installing the app.\n\nYou may contact ngCERT on incident@cert.gov.ng for technical assistance, You will also need to change the passwords to all of your online accounts, with urgency, around your online bank accounts, If you have concerns that your accounts may have been accessed by unauthorised people, contact your bank immediately.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Friday, charged the judiciary to speed up the process of justice delivery on cases of sexual and gender-based violence, noting that the conviction of more offenders will serve as a deterrent to others who might have the intention of committing the same crimes.\n\nObaseki gave the charge at a one-day sensitization and capacity building workshop on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) for High Court Judges and judicial officers in Edo State, held in Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor us in Edo, we consider gender-based violence as serious, which is why from the onset of our government we made a commitment to protecting the rights of vulnerable persons in our state.\n\n\u201cWe saw a tremendous increase in gender-based violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has prompted us to increase our actions in tackling the issue of abuses.\u201d\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe gruesome murder of Uwaila Omozuwa was a wake-up call for us. As a government, we couldn\u2019t just sit and allow our society to accept such conduct. It is our collective responsibility to drive the desired changes that are required to ensure that we have a society that is free of violence, particularly gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary is a very critical arm of government; you must play a very active role in addressing these challenges. We must get a lot more convictions because it\u2019s only convictions that serve as a deterrent to the abuse of persons.\n\n\u201cWe have worked with our lawmakers to update our statues to meet our present-day challenges, and are very much aware and understand the tasks ahead in establishing synergy and ensuring policy consistency across our three arms of government, as part of the efforts that we must understand to rein in offenders.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to protecting the girl-child in the state, the governor stated, \u201cIn Edo, our commitment to address gender-based violence or violence against persons has been demonstrated as we are one of the first states in Nigeria to sign the Violence Against Persons (VAP) Bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe have launched a sexual offenders\u2019 register which serves as a tool to shame all those persons who have been convicted in gender-based violence. We have linked our register with that of the national register. We are driven by the need to ensure that those who perpetrate gender-based violence are apprehended and made to face justice strictly.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cIt is important to note that Edo has established the Sexual Assault Referral Centre which is named after a girl, Vivian Ogu, whose life was cut short by criminals who tried to rape her, years ago. Addressing the menace of sexual-based violence has to be holistic and thorough.\n\n\u201cYou are all gathered here today because we want you to take charge of this mandate. We are lucky in Edo because the majority of our judges are women, so we do not have to preach to the converted.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the wife of Edo Governor, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki, who is the Chairperson of the Edo State Gender-Based Violence Management Committee, reiterated the need for more convictions in support of the government\u2019s fight against gender-based violence in the state.\n\nShe noted, \u201cLet us all be committed and take all we have learned from the workshop seriously and put them into practice, and taking our work to the international high level. At the end of the day, we want to see more convictions.\n\n\u201cThe governor has assured us of providing requisites; we need to build new courthouses and a special courthouse for gender-based violence, with special judges assigned to these courts.\u201d\n\nIn her welcome remarks, Ms. Comfort Lamptey, United Nations (UN) Women Representative to Nigeria and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who spoke via zoom, described the judiciary as crucial in ensuring access to justice for women and girls.\n\nLamptey further applauded the state government\u2019s commitment to ensuring access to justice for all, especially for women and girls in Edo.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has accused a London-based magazine, \u201dThe Economist\u201d of trying to denigrate, demonise and destabilise the Nigerian government in its recent article entitled \u201cInsurgency, secessionism and banditry threaten Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe respected news outlet, in the piece, had aptly reflected the worsening insecurity, banditry, and agitations that continue to ravage parts of the nation despite the efforts of the security agencies to curb the spike.\n\nBut the Director, Army Public Relations, Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement reacting to the piece on Saturday, disagrees, apparently seeing the article as a direct attack on the army.\n\nHe said the \u201cNigerian army remained a professional, hard-fighting and globally respected institution\u201d.\n\nMr Nwachukwu said the nation\u2019s army had continued to occupy deserved glorious positions in the comity of global defence forces.\n\nHe said the Nigerian army had distinguished itself as a worthy contributor to global peace and security through regional, continental and international peace keeping and peace support operations.\n\nThe army spokesperson said \u201cit was also wrong to denigrate an army that had restored democracies, brought peace to troubled lands and stabilised the sub-region, through dint of hard work, commitment to duty, discipline and professionalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the same army that had weathered the storm of terrorism and insurgency in the north eastern part of the country and parts of the Lake Chad region,\u201d he said, pointing out that the offending article contained \u201csome unimaginable slurs targeted at the Nigerian military and the Nigerian army in particular.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven as the real intention of the otherwise respected Economist magazine in publishing such toxic concoctions weaved up as report on Nigerian Government\u2019s response to the multi-faceted security challenges assailing the country is yet to be unravelled, the source of the article was very clear.\n\n\u201cIt is one of those deliberate falsehoods and noxious narratives orchestrated by a network of detractors and coven of dark forces working very hard to adorn the Nigerian Army in an unfitting garb of infamy.\n\n\u201cThe vile report which the Economist chose to offer to its platform for publication, spared no effort in trying to vilify and rubbish the image, character and reputational standing of the Nigerian army, but failed woefully.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian army is certainly not what the so-called report by the Economist tried to characterize it.\n\n\u201cEven more ludicrous was the embellishments of the said report by the notorious unprofessional media outlets that were quick to republish the obvious falsehood,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Nwachukwu also accused the international magazine of allowing its medium to be used for a \u201chatchet job\u201d and failing in its effort of finding out the real truth about the Nigerian army, saying \u201cwhat the magazine and its sources did not know, was that said army had successfully stopped the Islamic States West African Province (ISWAP)\u201d.\n\nHe said the magazine was misled by those who were uncomfortable with the commitment of army troops in stamping out terrorism, banditry and other violent crimes assailing the country and the West African sub-region.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe gallant officers and soldiers of Nigerian army were undeterred, undistracted and totally unfazed by the hare-brained assertions contained in that silly report.\u201d (NAN)",

          "text": "UK based magazine, The Economist, has described the government of President Muhammadu as inept, dictatorial and incompetent, that the Nigerian leader also failed to tackle corruption, which was his main campaign message in 2015.\n\nThe London based magazine which made the submission in an editorial titled, \u2018The Crime Scene at the Heart of Africa,\u2019 published in its October 23, 2021 issue, said due to Buhari\u2019s mismanagement of the economy, food prices had soared while life had become more difficult for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEconomic troubles are compounded by a government that is inept and heavy-handed. Mr Buhari, who was elected in 2015, turned an oil shock into a recession by propping up the naira and barring many imports in the hope this would spur domestic production,\u201d the editorial said.\n\n\u201cInstead he sent annual food inflation soaring above 20 per cent. He has failed to curb corruption, which breeds resentment. Many Nigerians are furious that they see so little benefit from the country\u2019s billions of petrodollars, much of which their rulers have squandered or stolen.\u201d\n\nThe Economist stated that even before COVID-19 last year, Nigeria was already witnessing unprecedented poverty, noting that this economic hardship was fuelling the current insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cTwo factors help explain Nigeria\u2019s increasing instability: a sick economy and a bumbling government. Slow growth and two recessions have made Nigerians poorer, on average, each year since oil prices fell in 2015,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cBefore COVID-19, 40 per cent of them were below Nigeria\u2019s extremely low poverty line of about $1 a day. If Nigeria\u2019s 36 states were stand-alone countries, more than one-third would be categorised by the World Bank as \u201clow-income\u201d (less than $1,045 a head). Poverty combined with stagnation tends to increase the risk of civil conflict,\u201d it argued.\n\nAccording to the editorial, the Nigerian military organisation as only strong on paper, even as it alleged hat the army had ghost workers on its payroll and often sold equipment to insurgents who destabilise the nation.\n\nThe news magazine said the Nigeria Police Force was poorly trained and underpaid hence they rob innocent citizens in order to augment their salaries.\n\nThe editorial further read, \u201cWhen violence erupts, the government does nothing or crack heads almost indiscriminately. Nigeria\u2019s Army is mighty on paper. But many of its soldiers are \u2018ghosts\u2019 who exist only on the payroll, and much of its equipment is stolen and sold to insurgents. The army is also stretched thin, having been deployed to all of Nigeria\u2019s states.\n\n\u201cThe police are understaffed, demoralised and poorly trained. Many supplement their low pay by robbing the public they have sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nIt called on the Department of State Services to stop disobeying court orders and release all those being detained illegally.\n\nThe Economist described as scandalous the refusal of the Nigerian government to arrest and prosecute any of the security operatives that killed protesters in Lagos last year.\n\nThe news magazine said in order to stop the slide towards lawlessness, Nigeria\u2019s government should make its own forces obey the law.\n\nThe editorial further read, \u201cSoldiers and police who murder or torture should be prosecuted. That no one has been held accountable for the slaughter of perhaps 15 peaceful demonstrators against police abuses in Lagos last year is a scandal. The secret police should stop ignoring court orders to release people who are being held illegally. This would not just be morally right, but also practical: young men who see or experience state brutality are more likely to join extremist groups.\u201d\n\nThe news magazine noted that Nigeria was home to one of the largest film industries in the world and had the most successful start-ups in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIt argued that despite the great potential of the country, youths were beginning to emigrate in droves because of the sorry state of Nigeria",

          "text": "The governorship election in Anambra state on 6 November looks uncertain after the Indigenous People of of Biafra (IPOB), declared one week sit-at-home protest from 5 Nov. till 10 November.\n\nThe group said the protest would be relaxed on Sunday 7 November to allow people to go to church.\n\nIf past experience is anything to go by, the streets of Anambra will be desolate on election day, unless Kanu is released before on on 4 November.\n\nIPOB\u2019s Media and Public Secretary , Emma Powerful announced the group decision in a statement on Saturday.\n\nHe said the action is being taken to protest the continuous incarceration of the leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, who has been held by DSS since late June, after he was kidnapped in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nIPOB said: \u201dFollowing the adjournment of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s court case to 10th of November 2021, by the Federal High Court Abuja, we the great movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra wish to inform Biafrans, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom that IPOB will lock down Biafraland from Nov. 5 to Nov. 10 except Sunday, Nov.7, a day our people worship the Almighty God if the Nigeria Government fails to release our leader unconditionally before Nov. 4 2021.\n\n\u201cOur leader must be released unconditionally on or before Nov. 4, because he has not committed any offence known to any law.\n\n\u201cFailure to release our leader on or before Nov. 4, 2021, our one week Sit-At-Home begins on Nov. 5, 2021 till Nov. 10.\n\n\u201cAlthough we quite understand the pains and adverse effects of this option on our people, we are compelled to take it to achieve a better purpose in the collective interest of Biafrans.\n\n\u201cWe have taken time to analyse what transpired on Oct. 21 when our Leader was arraigned in court and discovered that the federal government is not sincere and only wants to humiliate him and keep him perpetually in DSS custody to rot there.\n\n\u201cWe all saw how lawyers, journalists, Igbo delegates and respected traditional rulers and other people who came from all around the world to witness his court case were restricted and denied access into the court premises by security agents who kept them outside under the scorching heat of the sun. What a humiliation and wickedness!\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept that anymore. We can never allow our leader Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to be tried Secretly and we can never also allow him to be tried under Sharia law under any guise. Nigeria must follow International laws in handling our leader.\n\n\u201cUnless the federal government releases him unconditionally before November 4, we shall sacrifice one week for him as a warning protest to convey to our oppressors that Nnamdi Kanu represents over 70 million Biafrans.\n\n\u201cHe is innocent of all the charges preferred against him. As long as he is in detention our individual businesses do not matter so much because he is suffering for us all and we can\u2019t abandon him.\n\n\u201cWe seriously regret the inconveniences this may cause our people but it\u2019s a necessary sacrifice we need to make until we have our full independence. Nobody resident in Biafra land is expected to flout this directive as doing so amounts to challenging the will of the people on the Biafra project,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari and his security team appeared to have anticipated the action by IPOB as the issue came up at their meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe National Security Adviser Maj. General Babagana Monguno said Buhari has ordered that Anambra be overwhelmed by security men to ensure the election successfully holds.\n\nHowever, since the IPOB has been declaring sit-at-home protests, compliance level has been very high as IPOB appears to be the real political power in the south east region.\n\nLittle may change on 5 November when the protest begins.",

We have taken time to analyse what transpired on October 21 when our Leader was arraigned in court and discovered that the federal government is not sincere and only wants to humiliate him and keep him perpetually in DSS custody to rot there.\n\n\u201cWe all saw how lawyers, journalists, Igbo delegates and respected traditional rulers and other people who came from all around the world to witness his court case were restricted and denied access into the court premises by security agents who kept them outside under the scorching heat of the sun. What a humiliation and wickedness!\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept that anymore. We can never allow our leader onyendu Mazi Nnamdi KANU to be tried SECRETLY and we can never also allow him to be tried under SHARIA law under any guise. NIGERIA must follow International laws in handling our leader.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi KANU is in DSS dungeon today because of his passion for Biafra independence, and we must sacrifice all we can to ensure that he regains his freedom. He has sacrificed so much for us all, so we must be prepared to sacrifice little for him.\n\n\u201cUnless the federal government releases him unconditionally before November 4, we shall sacrifice one week for him as a warning protest to convey to our oppressors that Nnamdi Kanu represents over 70 million Biafrans. He is innocent of all the charges preferred against him. As long as he is in detention our individual businesses do not matter so much because he is suffering for us all and we can\u2019t abandon him.\n\n\u201cWe seriously regret the inconveniences this may cause our people but it\u2019s a necessary sacrifice we need to make until we have our full independence. Nobody resident in Biafra land is expected to flout this directive as doing so amounts to challenging the will of the people on the Biafra project.\n\n\u201cThis one week sit-at-home is also to let our oppressors understand that we are not going to tolerate any plan to torment or abandon our leader in DSS custody through frivolous court adjournments. Any plans to subject him to trauma in detention through long adjournments while real terrorists and mass murderers are having fun across the country cannot fly. Nnamdi Kanu must be freed because he committed no crime. Asking for referendum so that Biafrans will decide whether or not they want to continue as part of Nigeria is no crime. He should not suffer for seeking justice for his people.\n\n\u201cWe have been enslaved and caged enough by the Fulani controlled federal government of Nigeria and its allies.

Abas Tajudeen, the Director-General of the agency, Dr. Omale Joseph explained that not less than 15 percent of every 1,000 women die due to blood loss during childbirth and urged Nigerians to imbibe the practice of donating blood.\n\n\u201cAs you donate blood, you\u2019re saving a life, and not only that, research has shown that people who donate blood regularly live more healthy\u201d, he submitted.\n\nAccording to the DG, the Commission was putting the mechanism in place to check sharp practices by hospitals in the use of blood for patients, adding that through its One Million Safe Blood Initiative, it was expected that safe blood will be accessible for Nigerians in the six geopolitical zones of the country at any point in time.\n\nSpeaking further, he said the Commission which had the three core mandates of \u201cregulation, coordination and ensuring the provision of safe blood to the people\u201d, gave the assurance that plans were already in top gear to ensure that wastage of stored blood is halted through the use of expired blood for the production of usable components, noting that safe blood had a viable lifespan of between 30 and 35 days.\n\nFielding question on how Nigerians could be encouraged to have their blood groups handy to help in cases of emergency, the DG disclosed that for a start, the Commission was already collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) , to ensure that drivers\u2019 licenses are issued with the holder\u2019s blood IDs.\n\nEarlier Hon. Tajudeen had described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Bill as \u201ca very important milestone achieved in the health sector\u201d, as according to him, blood transfusion before now had been largely unregulated, with a lot of sharp practices involved.\n\nThe lawmaker said available statistics have shown that over 40 percent of voluntarily donated blood was unsafe for use, with the majority of donors doing so for monetary gains, adding that in some cases, recipients ended up being infected with diseases, but that with the Commission in place, a lot of such issues will be addressed.\n\nIt would be recalled the Commission\u2019s establishment Bill, which was introduced by Hon. Abas Tajudeen in the House of Representatives was passed in March 2021, got Senate\u2019s concurrence in June, and was subsequently signed into law by President Buhari.",

          "text": "The US Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on Nov. 1 a challenge to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on the procedure and lets private citizens enforce it \u2013 a case that could dramatically curtail abortion access in the United States if the justices endorse the measure\u2019s unique design.\n\nThe justices took up requests by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and abortion providers to immediately review their challenges to the law. The court, which on Sept. 1 allowed the law to go into effect, declined to act on the Justice Department\u2019s request to immediately block enforcement of the measure.\n\nThe court will consider whether the law\u2019s unusual private-enforcement structure prevents federal courts from intervening to strike it down and whether the federal government is even allowed to sue the state to try to block it.\n\nThe measure bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. It makes an exception for a documented medical emergency but not for cases of rape or incest.\n\nLiberal Justice Sotomayor dissented from the court\u2019s deferral of a decision on whether to block enforcement of the law while the litigation continues. Sotomayor said the law\u2019s novel design has suspended nearly all abortions in Texas, the second most populous U.S. state, with about 29 million people.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s gambit has worked. The impact is catastrophic,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.",

Instead, when Baldwin pulled the trigger Thursday, he killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, who was standing behind her.\n\nThe tragedy came nearly three decades after Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, died in a similar case, and it prompted horrified questions about how it could have happened again.\n\nThe executive producer of ABC\u2019s police drama \u201cThe Rookie\u201d announced Friday the show would no longer use \u201clive\u201d weapons because the \u201csafety of our cast and crew is too important.\u201d\n\nDetails of the shooting at the ranch on Bonanza Creek Road were included in a search warrant application filed by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Investigators were seeking to examine Baldwin\u2019s blood-stained costume for the film \u201cRust,\u201d as well as the weapon that was fired, other prop guns and ammunition, and any footage that might exist.\n\nThe gun was one of three that the film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, had set on a cart outside the building where a scene was being acted, according to the records. Halls grabbed the gun from the cart and brought it inside to Baldwin, unaware that it was loaded with live rounds, a detective wrote in the search warrant application.\n\nAP",
