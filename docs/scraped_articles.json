          "title": "Despite pictorial evidence, military says helicopter shot oil thieves in Rivers, not boat passengers",
          "text": "The Defence Headquarters on Sunday stated that a military chopper did not shoot boat passengers but \u201cillegal oil bunkerers\u2019\u201d carrying refined oil products in the Bonny Island of Rivers State last Thursday.\n\nSome Rivers boat operators last Thursday alleged that a military chopper opened fire on them while travelling from Port Harcourt to Bonny Island, injuring them in the process. They had claimed that the combat helicopter attacked their local wooden boat loaded with foodstuffs.\n\nHowever, in a statement published on DHQ Facebook page, the Director, Defence Information, Benjamin Sawyerr, said that the injured persons were oil thieves.\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018Re: Military Chopper Fires At Cargo Boat On Bonny River\u2019, partly reads, \u201cThe Air Component of the Joint Task Force Operation Delta State received reports from ground troops who were on clearance operations but encountered resistance at the point of encounter.\n\n\u201cOn receiving the report, a combat helicopter was dispatched to provide close air support mission along the Cawthorne Channel.\n\n\u201cThe helicopter encountered an illegal oil bunkerers\u2019 boat popularly called \u2018Cotonou Boat\u2019. The boat, which was being escorted by two speedboats, was suspected to be carrying illegally refined oil products in large drums along the Channel in the direction of OPDS patrol boats.\n\n\u201cOn sighting the boat, warning shots were fired to dissuade the crew from hostile action. The crew fired back at the helicopter and the boat was engaged accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe two speedboats detached from the convoy at high speed, leaving the \u2018Cotonou Boat,\u2019 which was neutralised.\n\n\u201cThe helicopter later went after the two speedboats but was unable to track it. The suspects are still at large and a manhunt has been sent out to apprehend them.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the DHQ failed to post photos showing the \u201cneutralised Cotonou Boat\u201d or \u201cillegally refined oil products in large drums\u201d to substantiate its claim, photos sent by our Rivers State Correspondent, Dennis Naku, who visited the scene of the incident on Thursday and spoke with the victims, show that the passenger boats had food items, with blood splattered all over them.\n\nWhen contacted via telephone on Monday morning, Sawyerr confirmed the DHQ statement to our correspondent, adding that the \u201cCotonou Boat\u201d was sunk and there were no photos of the incident.\n\nOf recent, the Nigerian Military has been accused of bombing innocent Nigerians, including soldiers, due to alleged miscalculations.\n\nIn April 2021, over 20 soldiers on ground were allegedly slain in Mainok, Borno State, when a Nigerian Air Force fighter jet responding to attacks on a military camp by Boko Haram insurgents bombed the military camp based on a wrong coordinate.\n\nNAF spokesman, Edward Gabkwet, had said that the incident was under investigation.\n\nSee photos of the attacked Rivers passenger boats as forwarded by our correspondent who visited the scene:",

          "title": "Rockets target U.S. troops as Afghanistan withdrawal enters final stage",
          "text": "U.S. anti-missile defences intercepted as many as five rockets fired at Kabul\u2019s airport early on Monday, a U.S. official said, as the United States rushed to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan to end its longest war.\n\nAfghan media said the attack was launched from the back of a vehicle.\n\nThe Pajhwok news agency said several rockets struck different parts of the Afghan capital.\n\nInitial reports did not indicate any U.S. casualties, the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.\n\nThe attack followed a huge Islamic State suicide bombing outside the airport gates on Thursday that killed scores of Afghans and 13 U.S. troops and another reported attempted bombing on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. and allied forces have evacuated about 114,400 people, including foreign nationals and Afghans deemed \u201cat-risk\u201d, in an effort that began a day before Kabul fell to the Taliban on Aug. 15. The forces themselves are due to pull out by a Tuesday deadline agreed with the Islamist militants.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reconfirmed his order for commanders to do \u201cwhatever is necessary to protect our forces on the ground\u201d after he was briefed on Monday\u2019s rocket fire, the White House said. He was told airport operations continued uninterrupted, it added.\n\nOn Sunday, Pentagon officials said a U.S. drone strike killed a suicide car bomber who had been preparing to attack the airport on behalf of ISIS-K, a local affiliate of Islamic State that is an enemy of both the West and the Taliban.\n\nU.S. Central Command said it was investigating reports of civilian casualties.\n\n\u201cWe know there were substantial and powerful subsequent explosions resulting from the destruction of the vehicle, indicating a large amount of explosive material inside that may have caused additional casualties,\u201d it said.\n\nThe drone attack killed seven people, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told China\u2019s state television CGTN on Monday, criticising the U.S. action on foreign soil as unlawful.\n\nIt was the second such condemnation after a U.S. drone strike on Saturday killed two Islamic State militants in the eastern province of Nangarhar, in an attack the spokesman said had wounded two women and a child.\n\nAfghans fearful of reprisals under Taliban rule continued to crowd the airport, appealing to foreign powers for a way out.\n\n\u201cWe are in danger,\u201d said one woman outside the airport. \u201cThey must show us a way to be saved. We must leave Afghanistan or they must provide a safe place for us.\u201d\n\nTwo U.S. officials told Reuters evacuations would continue on Monday, prioritising people deemed at extreme risk. Other countries have also put in last-minute requests to bring out people in that category, the officials said.\n\nThe Taliban will take full control of Kabul airport after the American withdrawal on Tuesday, Qatar\u2019s Al Jazeera television network cited an unidentified Taliban source as saying.\n\nAs the evacuations wind down, a \u201cfar greater humanitarian crisis\u201d looms ahead for the nation of 39 million people, the U.N. refugee agency warned.\n\nAgency chief Filippo Grandi reiterated a call for borders to remain open and for more countries to share the \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d of accepting refugees with Iran and Pakistan, which already host 2.2 million Afghans.\n\n\u201cMore resettlement options are sorely needed.\n\n\u201cThey are critically important, not only to save lives but also as a demonstration of goodwill,\u201d added Grandi, whose agency said last week that up to 500,000 Afghans could flee by year-end.\n\nREAD ALSO: Russia calls for conference to rebuild Afghan economy\n\nBiden attended a ceremony on Sunday at Dover Air Forces Base in Delaware to honour members of the U.S. military killed in Thursday\u2019s suicide bombing.\n\nAs the flag-draped transfer caskets carrying the remains emerged from a military plane, the president, who has vowed to avenge the Islamic State attack, shut his eyes and tilted his head back.\n\nNone of the fallen service members was older than 31, and five were just 20, as old as the war in Afghanistan itself.\n\nThe departure of the last troops will end the U.S.-led military intervention in Afghanistan that began in late 2001, after the al Qaeda Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nU.S.-backed forces ousted a Taliban government that had provided safe haven for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was finally killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011 and have engaged in a counter-insurgency war against the Islamist militants for the past two decades.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s rule from 1996 to 2001 was marked by a harsh version of sharia Islamic law, with many political rights and basic freedoms curtailed and women severely oppressed.\n\nSpokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has said the Taliban will announce a full cabinet in the coming days, and that difficulties will subside quickly once the new administration is in place.\n\nBut the economy has been shattered by decades of war, with the added burden of a drought and the coronavirus pandemic, and now faces a sudden halt in inflows of billions of dollars in foreign aid.

          "text": "Amid concerns over dwindling quality of products being churned out by educational institutions in Nigeria, the Catholic Primary Education Commission of Enugu Diocese is poised to employ artisan skilled workers to teach primary school pupils basic skills and technical education.\n\nSecretary of the commission, Very Rev. Fr. Michael Okoh made the disclosure, on Sunday, when the St. Joseph School of basic Skills and Development Ugwogo-Nike, was commissioned by the Auxiliary Bishop of Enugu Catholic Diocese, Most Rev. Ernest Obodo.\n\nPerforming the official commissioning and blessing of the school, Most Rev. Ernest Obodo said that the skills development school will uplift education standard, noting that in other climes, children begin from the cradle to combine learning with practical handcraft.\n\nObodo said that skills education creates faster employment and generates wealth and prayed to God to use the school to bring glory and upliftment to the people of Ugwogo-Nike community.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate Rev. Fr. Michael Okoh for the beautiful school, one of the best in Nigeria, it will now uplift education standard in Ugwogo. In other climes children begin from cradle to learn how to practice handcraft. That will generate employment and wealth creation,\u201d Bishop Obodo said.\n\nFounder of the School and Secretary of Catholic Primary Education Commission in Enugu Diocese, Very Rev. Fr. Dr. Michael Okoh said he was motivated into establishing the school because had been in charge of the management of the mission primary education since 2013 and found a missing gap in children\u2019s education.\n\nAccording to Rev. Fr. Okoh, \u201cMy long time study of primary education shows that there are so many important subjects they do right from primary one, even up to JS3, very good to our children but those subjects are not handled very well. They are just done theoretically and not practical.\n\n\u201cBecause the practical aspect is lacking, the children do not implement that, after school or even while at school, so that made me to think how we can make it possible so that a child will finish maybe primary six , even JS3 and be self employed and become an entrepreneur, so that you don\u2019t begin to look for work anywhere.\n\n\u201cThat made me begin to look into those subjects that one can also practically handle such as Basic science and Technology that covers a lot of things that one can practically do such as electrical works and solar installation is also into that and then computer is also technology and it will help our children very well.\n\n\u2018There is also the prevocational study which is vocational studies but because our children are not grounded practically they come out and there are a lot of skills related to that such as Fashion and Designing and so many other crafts. You can also talk about cultural and creative arts; music is there, playing of organ, recorders and others.\n\n\u201cSo because of that I decided to set up this school so that we can now combine basic education with skills development whereby the basic education system will be going on in basic 1, 2 and 3, children will be learning how to form syllabus and words and when they get to primary four, basic 4 basic 5 and basic 6 they can then be introduced to these various workshops and various skills, from there they can now continue so that before ever they finish JS3 they would have been trained very well in one thing or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nRev. Fr. Okoh disclosed that the school will employ artisans who would teach the pupils various technical skills in the very practical manner that they are done in the outside society workshops, noting that as a mission school, the cost of education will be subsidized.\n\nAccording to him, the school has skills departments such as Integrated Farming; Home Economics department; Carpentry and Upholstery department; Music department; Fashion and Designing; Electrical and Solar Installation department; Computer and Internet department and Solution Production department.\n\n\u201cWe are going to draw a curriculum and scheme of work for all these workshops, and we can be getting artisans, doing that theoretically, we can be getting artisans who have knowledge and also help us, they will be coming to help the children and train them. Going through the curriculum and the scheme of work, they can now use it with what they already know practically in order to help them out.\n\n\u201cThe teacher for Upholstery and Carpentry will be coming maybe once a week, the teacher will come and demonstrate practically and go and other teachers in other departments will be coming like that, so that if one is not good in wood work, he may be good in electrical works. If he is not good there, he may be good in Home Economics or even Fashion and designing or even in integrated farming,\u201d he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, delivering a paper on \u201cThe Role of Education in Community Development: Celebrating the Selflessness of a Genuine Soul-Blessing of St. Joseph School of Basic Skills Development (SJS) Ugwogo-Nike,\u201d Rev. Fr. Nnaemeka Udeonu said that the school had the capacity to increase access to university education for future skilled children who could eventually be of serious help in reduction of the financial burdens associated with university education.\n\n\u201cAkuruouno is truly pregnant with a lot of meaning that has the capacity to transform Ugwogo Nike into an unbeatable example of a Modern city. The selflessness of Very Rev. Fr, Dr. Michael Ndubuisi Okoh is an excellent example and unbeatable motivation in this regard,\u201d Rev Fr Udeonu said.\n\nIn a remark, the House of Representative member for Enugu East/Isi-Uzo Federal Constituency, Hon. Cornelius Nnaji said that the school came at the right time when there is a lack of jobs for the younger Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe school is good because there are no more jobs, but with a skills school such as this, a foundation for job creation is already made.\n\n\u2018Rev Fr. Ukoh had done a similar thing in Nchatacha-Nike because of his passion for education of children and the youths and we thank him for these personal efforts,\u201d Nnaji stated.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is a worthy initiative. Everybody present was delighted and applauded those behind it as the details were unfolded at a well attended meeting of some private schools owners in Lagos and a public \u2013 spirited organisation.\n\nWith a mission to enrich lives through social development while improving the delivery of academic knowledge among pupils, \u201d Call to Love Initiative \u201d is determined to provide funding to what it calls \u201d low cost private schools\u201d in Lagos state.\n\nSuch schools are mainly found in neglected neighbourhoods and low income areas in the state and attended mainly by children of low income earners.\n\nThe learning environment of such schools is poor, buildings dilapidated, instructional materials inadequate and staff poorly remunerated. Nonetheless, the owners are rendering services that cannot be discountenanced. To raise the quality of services being rendered, the Call To Love Initiative has come out with a special package in conjunction with the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund.\n\nFounder of the initiative, Omowumi Ajila, espoused the details at the meeting held at office of the Lagos state branch of the Nigerian Red Cross Society.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cOver the years, we collate feedback from our beneficiaries about their school; they are grateful for their school and teachers and wish their school had better facilities and ambience.\n\n\u201cWhile we are aware that the schools are passionate about giving the best to their pupils, most of the facilities require funding.\n\nRead Also: Research on inclusive education presented in Lagos\n\n\u201cThat is why we are glad that the Lagos State Government through, the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund, has a dedicated fund for low fees schools to improve the quality of facilities and education to these pupils.\u201d\n\nShe said the LSETF for low-cost Private Schools, by the Lagos State Government, was to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe loan program of LSETF, in partnership with First Bank of Nigeria and EdFin Microfinance Bank, is to address the challenges of access to fund by low-cost schools operating within Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThe criteria to access the loan include; schools operational in Lagos State, a maximum loan size of N5 million with a 12 to 24 months tenure, an interest rate of 9 per cent and equity provided by approved beneficiaries which will be 5 per cent of loan size.\u201d\n\nSpeaking more about the organisation, she said Call To Love was founded in 2010, and has impacted over 900 beneficiaries through its plethora of interventions.\n\n\u201cOne of these interventions is the annual Making A Difference with Education (MWE) Summer Camp programme for low-cost school pupils, a flagship programme created for children unable to complete their education; to attain their full potential.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to build the beneficiaries capacity outside of their core, give academic, financial and social support and improve the teaching environment of primary schools.\u201d\n\nAddressing guests at the graduation ceremony of the 2021 MWE Summer Camp, which was held simultaneously with the breakfast forum, Omowunmi said: \u201cOur approach of engagement is to bond with these children and get to know areas where we can be of assistance in terms of their social development.\n\n\u201cThey are the sixth set and introduced to a wider range of soft skills like catering, graphic design, recycled art and wellness.\u201d",
          "summary": "Everybody present was delighted and applauded those behind it as the details were unfolded at a well attended meeting of some private schools owners in Lagos and a public \u2013 spirited organisation.\nSuch schools are mainly found in neglected neighbourhoods and low income areas in the state and attended mainly by children of low income earners.\nTo raise the quality of services being rendered, the Call To Love Initiative has come out with a special package in conjunction with the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund.\nFounder of the initiative, Omowumi Ajila, espoused the details at the meeting held at office of the Lagos state branch of the Nigerian Red Cross Society.\n\u201cWhile we are aware that the schools are passionate about giving the best to their pupils, most of the facilities require funding.",

          "text": "By Wilfred Eya, Magnus Eze, Enugu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa, Tony Osauzo, Benin, Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nNigeria\u2019s apex socio-cultural organisations, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere, Middle-Belt Forum, the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), Intersociety, as awell as former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Ghali Umar Na\u2019Abba, leader of the defunct Niger Delta Volunteer Force (NDVF), Alhaji Mujadid Asari-Dokubo, ormer secretary general of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and others have lambasted the Federal Government for defending the non-classification of bandits and killer herdsmen as terrorists.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu in an interview with BBC Pidgin on Saturday gave reasons why President Muhammadu Buhari was yet to declare bandits wreaking havoc across states as terrorists like he did to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\n\u201cWhat the Buhari administration has done to the arms-wielding bandits is worse than being declared as terrorists. Do you know that there is a subsisting order by the President that any arms-wielding, AK-47 bandits should be shot on sight? I am saying yes, IPOB has been prescribed by law of the land. There is no shoot-on-sight order on IPOB. There is nothing to suggest that these bandits are treated preferentially,\u201d the Presidency spokesman had said.\n\nHe also argued that Buhari\u2019s administration was not in anyway giving bandits any form of preferential treatment as they were being killed in their hundreds.\n\nAsked why bandits who have done more harm compared to the proscribed IPOB were still not declared terrorists by President Buhari administration, Shehu said: \u201cYes, we hear that a lot of times. But I want to say I disagree with that position. The Nigerian Airforce is busy bombing locations in the forest, the military is there on the ground exchanging fire and taking them out in hundreds, that is certainly not treating people lightly. Well, I am not suggesting bombing IPOB or anybody. I want to say that the entire weaponry is today targeted at these bandits and terrorists.\u201d\n\nBut respondents, yesterday, accused President Buhari\u2019s administration of double standards and playing politics with lives of the people.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo Socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, said whether government declared bandits terrorists or not, their actions have portrayed them as such.\n\n\u201cYou become a terrorist the moment you compel people into action that is contrary to their decision. So, whether the government declares them terrorists or not, that is what they are. The earlier you identify your problem properly, the earlier you begin to articulate solutions to the problem. A good diagnosis will lead to a better prescription, but when you diagnose wrongly, there is no way you will get an appropriate prescription. Therefore, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo will urge the Federal Government to diagnose properly in order to get a good prescription to the problem,\u201d he stated.\n\nLeader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Nigerians cannot be fooled any longer as they were aware that the body language of the president encourages herders and bandits in their activities.\n\nHe wondered what the Federal Government had done to the often arrested members of Boko Haram to serve as a deterrent to others.\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus, said whether government calls them bandits, herdsmen or unknown gunmen, they were agents of terror and as such they are terrorists.\n\n\u201cFor the government not to have declared people who are agents of terror as terrorists, simply means that the government is protecting them from the punishment that terrorists deserve. The international community has declared the Fulani herdsmen as the fourth most dangerous terrorist groups in the world. So, whether government accepts it or not, they are terrorists and Nigerians see them as such,\u201d he submitted.\n\n\u2022FG giving preferential treatment to bandits, herdsmen\n\nYCE Secretary-General, Dr. Kunle Olajide, said Federal Government has been biased in the way it handled the issues of Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) in the South East, Yoruba self-determination groups in the South West, Miyetti Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and banditry in northern Nigeria.\n\nHe said government has been unfair to IPOB and self-determination groups, including the Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Federal Government has not declared bandits as a terrorist group means that they are enjoying preferential treatment. In fact, Miyetti Allah has been very severely offensive at a time, addressing the media, threatening people, issuing threats and insisting that they would continue open grazing on our land, as well as maiming and killing people. Then the bandits anyway, their acts are there for everybody to see. They commit crimes almost on daily basis. So, I do not see what IPOB has done to merit being declared as a terrorist organisation. It is an unfair treatment to IPOB. Then, the government has to be a little bit discreet and they should reconsider their stand in declaring IPOB as a terrorist organisation.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the Federal Government is frightened. Possibly, they themselves have judged their steps, and believe that this self-determination agitation must have genuine basis; that is why they embarked on terrorising or at least harassing those who are leading self-determination groups. But self-determination is allowed in democracy, if you have enough numbers as recognised by the United Nations. Then, the UN might start considering conducting a referendum. You cannot be compelled to belong to where your life is being threatened and where you don\u2019t have justice.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Igboho has merely been demonstrating. He has not carried arms. He has not done anything and against the herdsmen, except those that went to his house. And he would not have known if they were police. Those that were defending him heard gunshot at the dead of the night and they responded too. So, I think the Federal Government needs to be a little bit careful. They should not increase the tension and the political temperature of the country, and they should be seen to be very mature.The Federal Government should declare bandits as terrorist group too. Anybody who maims and kills without justification is a terrorist.\u201d\n\nFormer Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Ghali Umar Na\u2019Abba also faulted Garba Shehu\u2019s position that there is a subsisting shoot-sight order against AK-47 carrying herders as it was not backed by any law.\n\nHe accused the Presidency of politicising important security matters and trying to be clever by half.\n\nThree leading groups in the South East, ADF, COSEYL and Intersociety accused President Muhammadu Buhari was treating bandits and self-determination agitators with partiality.\n\nCOSEYL president, Goodluck Ibem cited the way the Federal Government hurriedly proscribed unarmed self-determination group, IPOB, without due lawful or constitutional process, as a good case in point if its partiality.\n\n\u201cFulani herdsmen and bandits kill Nigerians on daily basis and the Federal Government has kept quiet without proscribing them. Since the Federal Government gave directive to security agents to shoot-at-sight gun-welding herdsmen, who have they shoot or arrested since such order was given,\u201d Ibem queried.\n\nADF spokesman, Abia Onyike, said IPOB has been proscribed since 2017 while other separatist movements, organizations and killer squads were being pampered.\n\nOnyike however, stated that the shoot-at-sight order by a democratically elected president means that he \u201csupports extra-judicial killings in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBoard Chairman of Intersociety, Emeka Umeagbalasi said the Presidency\u2019s statement confirmed that it has been involved in genocidal acts.\n\nUmeagbalasi said: \u201cThis same Government sending soldiers and police special squads to invade forests and critical social enclaves to kill innocent and defenseless Igbo citizens and criminally and atrociously labeling them is the same brazenly and rapaciously romancing with Islamic jihadists of different colours and identities including amnestying them, protecting them, shielding them and conscripting them into the armed forces. We have a verified video evidence recorded and aired as a national news where former governor Shettima of Borno State was welcoming hundreds of Boko Haram jihadists, tagged \u201cex-Boko Haram fighters\u201d into the armed forces.\u201d\n\n\u2022Buhari\u2019s govt thinks we\u2019re stupid\n\nLeader of NDVF, Asari-Dokubo, described the Buhari-administration as the most insensitive government in the history of Nigeria. He said government would suffer the consequences of its deceit.\n\n\u201cSo, why did the government declare IPOB as a terrorist organisation and left bandits? Has IPOB done half of what bandits have done? These bandits have attacked school and kidnapped schoolchildren. They have killed people and even attacked the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA). The Buhari government is the most wicked government in the history of Nigeria. The government thinks we are stupid. Their actions would definitely have consequences.\u201d\n\n\u2022Hidden agenda\n\nProfessor at the University of Benin, Edeaghe Ehikhamenor, claimed refusal to declare bandits as terrorists is because of a hidden agenda of President Buhari. He said the president is aware that the moment he declares Meiyetti Allah and bandits as terrorist groups, those networking with them from outside would stop doing so.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that Nigerians in their numbers know these people are terrorists\u201d, he said, lamenting that whereas those agitating for self-determination have been declared terrorists, those kidnapping people, schoolchildren and who killed hundreds of Nigerians and confined thousands of others into IDPs camps were being compensated instead of being declared terrorists. The only thing that can save Nigeria now is a major implosion in the camp of the bandits,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting, Sani, said those using terror to attack people should be declared terrorists.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, all those using terror or violence, be they insurgents, armed robbers, rapists and ritual killers are terrorists precisely because they use terror to torment and kill innocent people. They are terrorists and should be treated as such.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

What did he take as his oath of office? Banditry is now a great trade in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLook at the massacre in Jos and the president keeps quiet only for the security operatives to react when the youths decided to defend the people. Human lives have become nothing in Nigeria. And you cannot advise the Federal Government because the man in charge and his people have a mindset,\u201d he said.\n\nThe archbishop wondered what the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) was waiting for before it could rise to the occasion to say no to what he described as holocaust sweeping across the country.\n\n\u201cChristian leaders are keeping quiet. What is the CAN doing? If all the religious leaders could come out en masse whether Catholic, Pentecostal, Anglican and whatever denomination, indeed, all church leaders and stage a nationwide protest for the whole world to hear them, that would be a good step in the right direction, \u201c he said.\n\nThe archbishop said his support for the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, hinged on the fact that Kanu is the Moses of the present generation of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cLet them let us go because it is even in their own advantage because we will be exporting a lot of things to them as we are highly enterprising.\n\n\u201cOur governors keep quite because they are getting peanuts from the centre. The economy of South East can receive a boom if railway lines are built crisscrossing the major cities in the zone.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian military has been compromised. How can bandits swoop on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), kill three Christian military officers and escape just like that. People are being killed like rats every day and you want me to be happy as a religious leader. No. That is too bad,\u201d he said.\n\nThe archbishop said going to Okigwe Archdiocese was like sending him back to his root which, he said, would offer him the opportunity to put in his best to reposition the place.\n\nHe said his becoming an archbishop was divine as there was no struggle for it.\n\n\u201cGod told me I was not competing with anybody, that I should walk at my own pace. My elevation to the position of an archbishop witnessed the hand of God in it and what God has destined can never be changed by any man. I thank the Prelate, Samuel Uche, and every other person God used to elevate me and I promise, I will never disappoint anybody. I give God the glory,\u201d he said.\n\nLay President of the Onitsha Diocese, Onyeka Nwulor, who flanked the archbishop in the course of the interview, said the election of Onuagha was unopposed and the hand of God as he witnessed it, saying the Onitsha Diocese was very excited.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Concerns Mount as Court Injunctions, Orders Threaten Nation\u2019s Democracy",
          "text": "\u2022Rulings for sale to highest bidder\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe increasing meddlesome interventions of the judiciary in almost every stratum of the political turf is fast threatening the nation\u2019s hard earned democracy and becoming a source of concern to stakeholders, especially, as the country moves closer to the 2023 elections.\n\nFrom Port Harcourt to Kebbi and then, Calabar as seen in the past few days in the Peoples Democratic (PDP) as well as events leading to the Anambra gubernatorial election, stakeholders are worried that the trend signposts possible dangers ahead, even as they rebuked members of the judiciary for making themselves readily available for the dirty biddings of politicians.\n\nThe courts, many well-meaning Nigerians are worried, might have become a market place for politicians to buy injunctions and exparte orders, and at the rate things are going, it may be difficult to draw the lines that Judges will not cross just to do the bidding of politicians.\n\nThe ease with which judges allow themselves to be manipulated by senior lawyers in pursuit of narrow self-interest is baffling to many, who now see the judiciary as a major threat to the nation\u2019s democracy. Some of the actions of judges defy logic and reason causing the layman on the street to ask questions and raise suspicion of underhand dealings.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now embarrassing. It is now so easy for any group to move into any court to get a judgment. All they need do is to get a pliant judge. It is unfortunate that the judges are the ones that determine, who holds political position in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are so many interventions by the judiciary across the country. They make governors, senators; they issue injunctions and they now sell injunctions. You have case in Akwa Ibom, you go to Sokoto to get a judgment and then INEC has to obey. So, it is an abuse. With the way they are going, you can even get an injunction for marriages in Jigawa,\u201d a senior lawyer, who pleaded to remain anonymous, said.\n\nFor instance, in the PDP, early last week, a High Court in Rivers State, had issued an order of interim injunction, restraining Uche Secondus from carrying on as national chairman of the party, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office.\n\nSecondus, according to the ruling, had been ordered to stop parading himself as a member of the PDP on grounds of his suspension from the party.\n\nJustice O. Gbasam of the Degema Division of a High Court of Rivers State, sitting in Port Harcourt, had issued the orders while delivering ruling in an exparte application by some chieftains of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nBut two days after, Justice Nusirat. I. Umar, a vacation Judge of the Kebbi State High Court of coordinate jurisdiction with the one in Rivers State and who was clearly aware of the case already in Rivers State, not only entertained the case, she gave her own orders restoring the embattled National Chairman of the party to his position.\n\nThis was after the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Party, Elder Yemi Akinwomi, had assumed leadership of the PDP in acting capacity.\n\nIn a suit brought before her in Birinin Kebbi, the state capital in case KB/AC/M. 170/2021, Justice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affidavit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable court granting leave to the first respondent (Uche Secondus) to continue exercising all the constitutional powers of the office of Chairman of PDP (second defendant) as enshrined in both 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended and the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s constitution pending the hearing and final determination of applicant\u2019s motion on notice,\u201d the order stated.\n\nRegrettably, 24-hours after the Kebbi State ruling, the crisis in the political party took a new twist as this time another court in Calabar, Cross River State, further restrained Secondus from parading himself as chairman as well as from presiding over the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party held at the weekend.\n\nAny right thinking person will know that something was surely wrong with a system that tolerates such abuse and mockery of such a critical arm of state. But Judges and many senior lawyers appear to care less about the consequential implications of their behaviour, which had brought disrepute and dishonour to the judiciary.\n\nThe interim order was issued by the court, presided over by Justice Edem Kufre, last Friday, upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani.\n\nThe situation is not different in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), which had also been engulfed with leadership squabble between the Jude Okeke and Victor Oye factions. This has seen leaders of the same party move from one court to the other shopping for injunction in their quest to control the party and ensure their candidates are recognised ahead of the November gubernatorial election, thus further polarising the party.\n\nIn the case of the APGA, former Cnetral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Chukwuma Soludo is having a running battle with Chukwuma Umeoji. The litigations are tied to who is the authentic Chairman of APGA in Anambra State amongst Chief Victor Oye, Chief Njoku and Jude Okeke.\n\nMeanwhile, judges in Anambra, Jigawa, Imo and Abuja have intervened in the matter causing INEC to at various times list and delist both the names of Soludo and Umeoji as candidate of APGA.\n\nThe electoral umpire had on July 16 published the name of Umeoji as the APGA candidate following an order by the Jigawa State High Court on June 28.\n\nOn July 18 justice Charles Okaa of Anambra State High Court directed INEC to publish Soludo\u2019s name as APGA\u2019s candidate. Meanwhile justice Iheka of the Imo State High Court again ordered INEC to publish Umeoji\u2019s name.\n\nReacting to the confusion, Justice Nwosu-Iheme berated the judges for indulging politicians, who go round the country shopping for judgments to enable them be on the ballot. According to her, the judges, who indulge these politicians are bringing the legal profession to public ridicule.\n\nThe PDP in Anambra State is in a terrible position as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) presently does not recognise either the Valentine Ozigbo or Senator Ugochukwu Uba factions, because of a plethora court injunctions.\n\nA former National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, was also removed after legal fireworks that saw the former labour leader and his then rivals from the Federal High Court in Kano, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, among others, in the battle for the soul of the party.\n\nSome three weeks ago, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) warned that except the leadership of both the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and the National Judicial Council (NJC) intervened, the seemingly endless and conflicting court orders over political parties\u2019 affairs could jeopardise preparations for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC, which lamented the level of distraction the commission had begun to face as a result of litigations arising from the Anambra State governorship primary elections, however, restated its commitment to the use of technology in conducting elections, because it was the only way to credible and transparent polls.\n\nWhile maintaining that new and conflicting court orders from all parts of the country kept flooding its headquarters on a daily basis, the commission said it was not only frustrating but also causing it to keep recognising one candidate over the other, and changing same again in the major political parties.\n\nNational Commissioner for Voter Education, Festus Okoye, who hinted at the concerns in Awka, Anambra State, said, \u201cThis (litigations) is frustrating. What the commission does in terms of obedience to court orders is that if a judgment comes today, the commission obeys the order, because it is the latest in time.\n\n\u201cIf on the same issue, another court of coordinate jurisdiction, or from a court of another judicial division comes to us, because that one is the latest in time, the commission obeys that one.\n\n\u201cSo, what the political parties have been doing, and what they are doing is that they anticipate the commission, and the moment you\u2019re proceeding, they get court orders. This is impeding our performance and making things difficult.\n\n\u201cElections require sanctity and adherence to guidelines, the leadership of the NBA and the NJC should look at this. This is urgent and imperative, because if it persists, this can jeopardise the conduct of the 2023 general election. We are having court orders on a daily basis from courts in all parts of the country and that is not right.\u201d\n\nAlthough sections of the country\u2019s constitution and the Electoral Act allow the judiciary, (courts and election tribunals) to intervene particularly, when issues of non-compliance, manipulation, violence etc are alleged to mar the process of electing a particular representative, however, recent developments seems to portray the fact that these days, the judges rather than the people choose the leaders.\n\nA peculiar case in recent times is that of a South Eastern State where the governor was referred to as the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d governor, simply because he was declared winner of the 2019 governorship election, after coming a distant fourth in the poll.\n\nThe intervention of the courts whether at pre-election cases or election petitions are taking a worrisome dimension as their judgments to most aggrieved parties and even the people seem to be far from justice, particularly, when such courts or judges lacked the necessary jurisdiction in the first place to hear the case brought before them.\n\nThe situation, was so bad that sometime last year, former Chief Judge of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Justice Ishaq Bello had to issue a practice directive warning justice against delving into cases outside their jurisdiction as well as issuing all sorts of retraining orders in election matters.\n\nBut it seems the warning may have fallen on deaf ears as the situation rather than abating is getting worse. Only recently, a Justice of the Court of Appeal, Chioma Nwosu-Iheme, while delivering judgment called for the punishment of a Jigawa State High Court judge, Justice Ubale and his Imo State counterpart, Justice B. C. Iheka over what she described as professional misconduct by dabbling into the Anambra State gubernatorial election controversy and gave consequential judgments on it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Katsina already training people to defend themselves\n\n\u2022Reiterates stand on call to arm\n\n\u2022Worries state is policed by less than 3,000 officers\n\n\u2022Insists open grazing is causing trouble\n\nObinna Chima\n\nFor the umpteenth time, the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has said if the country truly intended to get a hold of the deteriorating security situation, then, it must embrace multi-level policing otherwise called state police.\n\nThe governor, whose state has been under intense fire from bandits and insurgents, reiterated his recent call for the people of Katsina to procure arms and defend themselves, sand added his government had begun to train people to defend themselves.\n\nWhile decrying the growing insecurity in the country, Masari expressed concern that the number of policemen available to his state were less than 3,000 and therefore not enough to protect the citizens.\n\nMasari, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who spoke in an interview monitored on national television at the weekend, therefore, reiterated his support for state police, saying there was a need for it to be accommodated in the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, working with the Nigeria Police Force, his administration had been training people to defend their villages and communities.\n\n\u201cKnowing full well how long it will take the police to improve its capacity to be able to provide the much-needed security for villages and communities, are you saying people should fold their arms?\n\n\u201cIf somebody slaps you, the natural instinct is to raise your hands up, and if he comes with a stick, you take a stick to protect yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s home state governor, disclosed that this week, his government would complete the training of 500 vigilantes, who were trained by the police and armed forces, saying in the coming week, training for another 500 would be completed.\n\nHe said the target was to have 3,000 trained vigilante working with the police and other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe situation we have on ground is such that bandits would come to a village, kidnap and collect over N500,000 from villagers and in some cases get N5 million from them.\n\n\u201cAnd in same village, when you say come let us contribute and train these vigilantes to defend them at night, they would not give you N20,000,\u201d he said.\n\nLamenting that Katsina, which has an estimated population of between seven and eight million persons, the governor claimed presently has only 3,000 policemen.\n\nDefending his recent call for citizens to defend themselves as the way out of the the present situation, Masari argued that the efforts his administration made to achieve peace in his first two years in office could not be sustained because same wasn\u2019t made in Zamfara and some other neighboring states at that time.\n\n\u201cI have no regret in what I said (that people should defend themselves). But what is the natural instinct of every living thing? It is to protect himself against events happening around him for him to survive.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a simple scenario. Katsina State as of 2006 had a population of 5.6 million, even if we are growing at three per cent, what would be the population by 2021?\n\n\u201cWe are projecting a population of seven to eight million. Now, what is the total strength of the police in Katsina? The total strength of the police in the state is not up to 3,000. So, if you divide the number of policemen by the population, you have an average of one policeman to over 200,000 people. What form of ammunition does the policemen have?\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, Masari explained that, in his state, a local government with 34 policemen, had over 300 villages and towns to secure.\n\n\u201cThey (police) lack logistics in terms of equipment to move around, they lack the necessary weapons and above all, they lack the technology.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the military, how many are they in Katsina? The military are in all the states of the country, what equipment and level of technology are they applying? Look, when you are faced with reality of daily killings, daily kidnappings, daily raping and daily cattle rustling, you will understand. In Katsina, we wake up every day to these realities,\u201d Masari added.\n\nLending his support for the anti-open grazing legislation, the president\u2019s governor said, his state had a ranching programme that would cost about N12.5 billion, out of which the federal government already supported it with 50 per cent, while the state would provide 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cWhen we were growing up we had community grazing areas, where you take your sheep, goat and cattle to graze, without going to other people\u2019s farm,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe, therefore, advocated that, \u201cWe should stop open-grazing; it is causing trouble,\u201d adding that, \u201cAnybody living in the forest, for me, is a criminal.\u201d\n\nAbout a week ago, the seemingly helpless security situation in Katsina had caused two members of the state House of Assembly to publicly shed tears while deliberating on the worsening state of insecurity in the state.\n\nDuring plenary presided over by the Speaker, Alhaji Tasi\u2019u Maigari, the Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Shehu Dalhatu-Tafoki, in a motion of urgent public importance, decried how despite government and security agencies\u2019 efforts, the insecurity situation in the state seems to be increasing.\n\nDalhatu-Taofiki, urged the government in conjunction with security agencies, to adopt a new approach and also increase the number of outposts, especially, in the affected areas to tame the menace of banditry in the state.\n\n\u201cThe security operative need to increase their outposts across the state, especially, in the areas mostly disturbed by the bandits. The outposts in those areas are not enough; they cannot overpower the bandits, despite the huge amounts of money being spent on them,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAlso, reacting to the motion, Alhaji Haruna Goma, member representing Dandume Constituency, could not hold back his tears as he narrated how the cruel bandits wasted the lives of not less than 11 persons and abducted scores in Dandume recently.\n\nSimilarly, Alhaji Abubakar Mohammed, member representing Funtua constituency, equally wept why recounting how the hoodlums terrorised their communities in the last one month, killing and kidnapping scores.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the insecurity challenge plaguing the state was unimaginable, because about 32 out of the 34 LGAs in the state were now being threatened by the bandits.\n\nIn May, Deputy Speaker of the state, Shehu Tafoki, had also cried profusely while talking about rising insecurity in his constituency. He broke down in tears during a special sitting on insecurity by the Assembly.\n\nHe said hardly did a day go by without reported attacks across the area, adding that many had been killed, maimed and kidnapped.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nIn a clear demonstration of its resilience, Zenith Bank Plc has announced its audited results for the half-year (HI) ended 30 June 2021, recording positive growth across key financial metrics despite a challenging macroeconomic environment exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited half-year financial results presented to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), the Group recorded a growth in profit before tax of three per cent, from the N114 billion reported in H1 2020, to N117 billion in H1 2021.\n\nThe Group also recorded a nine per cent growth in non-interest income from N116 billion in June 2020, to N127 billion in June 2021.\n\nOverall, the significant reduction in interest expense by 26 per cent and growth in non-interest income by nine per cent culminated in improved profitability.\n\nThe Group\u2019s retail journey continued to deliver positive results as retail deposits grew by N38.2 billion from N1.72 trillion to N1.76 trillion year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAlso, the financial institution\u2019s savings balances grew marginally by two per cent YTD to close at N1.18 trillion, from N1.16 trillion as at December 2020.\n\nThe drive for increased retail deposits and a low-interest yield environment helped reduce the cost of funding from 2.2 per cent to 1.3 per cent in the current period. Furthermore, the results showed that operating expenses grew by 10 per cent year-on-year, but growth remained below the inflation rate, while the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS), which grew two per cent from N3.30 to N3.38 for the half-year ended June 2021.\n\nThe Group also increased total customer deposits by eight per cent to close the period at N5.77 trillion, demonstrating growth in its market share, just as total assets grew marginally to N8.52 trillion as at June 30, 2021, from the N8.48 trillion recorded as at December 31, 2020.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic induced challenges and the challenging operating environment, the Group grew its risk assets as gross loans were up three per cent year-to-date, from N2.92 trillion to N2.99 trillion.\n\nThis was conservatively achieved at a low non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio of 4.51 per cent (FYE 2020: 4.29%) and a reduced cost of risk of 1.3 per cent (June 2020: 1.8%).\n\nIt prudential ratios such as liquidity and capital adequacy also remained above regulatory thresholds at 69.9 per cent and 22 per cent respectively.\n\nDespite the continued prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is cautious optimism that the global economy will continue to recover as vaccination programmes are intensified.\n\nOn the domestic economy, Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, and the inflation rate, which peaked in March 2021 at 18.17 per cent is gradually trending down and currently at 17.38 per cent as at July 2021.\n\nZenith Bank in the statement explained that it has been well-positioned to maximise the opportunities that the recovering fundamentals present while leveraging technology to expand its retail footprints to deliver improved returns to all its stakeholders.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom.\n\nAlso, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, and Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine.\n\nThe bank was also recognised as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020, Retail Bank of the year at the 2020 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards, and Best Company in Promotion of Good Health and Well-Being as well as Best Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment at the Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2020.\n\n\u201cZenith Bank has grown enormously in 30 years to become Nigeria\u2019s largest and one of Africa\u2019s largest financial institutions by tier-1 capital, with shareholders\u2019 funds of NGN1.1 trillion ($2.64 billion) as at 31st December 2020.\n\n\u201cThe bank continues to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices.\n\n\u201cZenith Bank is the clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in the deployment of innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Denies deposit of N9.7bn in his account, bank refutes report\n\n*Ex-minister threatens to sue online newspaper, demands N3bn compensation over defamatory publication\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nA former Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr Ibe Kachikwu, has explained how he recovered his jaguar car, which was erroneously impounded by US authorities, and maliciously described as stolen in some online reports. Kachikwu denied receiving N9.7 billion in his bank account, and threatened to sue an online publication that claimed he smuggled the jaguar car to the US and was impounded.\n\nFirst Bank also denied the publication with regard to his transaction with the bank.\n\nThe former minister made a demand of N3 billion compensation from the online publication, People\u2019s Gazette, following the false and malicious publication.\n\nThe minister, in a letter addressed to the Publisher of the People\u2019s Gazette through his counsel, Mike Ozhekome\u2019s Chambers and titled: \u201cLibelous Publications against Dr Ibe Kachikwu-Demand for Retraction and Compensation\u201d, sought the sum of N3 billion as compensation and a retraction of the said publication.\n\nIt said the online newspaper had in its August 23, 2021 edition claimed that Kachikwu purchased a stolen vehicle, which was smuggled from a United Kingdom Assembly to California in the United States. It said the publication \u201cmaliciously and falsely\u201d portrayed the former minister as a smuggler.\n\nThe letter also stated that the publication claimed the former minister received the sum of N9.7 billion in his First Bank account while he served as minister, which it said denoted his appetite for luxury goods and accommodation.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cThe aforementioned publications, which were deliberately calculated to do maximum damage to his esteemed person, image and hard-earned goodwill and integrity, falsely alleged that our client smuggled a stolen jaguar car into the United States of America.\n\n\u201cYou went further in your baseless, provocative and malicious publication to falsely allege that our client \u2018received N9.7 billion in his personal First Bank account, which denotes his appetite for luxury good and accommodation\u2019 and portrayed our client as a corrupt, dishonest, dishonourable, unscrupulous, debased and degenerated decadent public officer.\u201d\n\nKachikwu, also a former Group Managing Director of NNPC, said through his lawyers he was inundated with calls, messages, emails from friends and associates from within and outside the country, who have expressed worry and concern over the development.\n\nThe letter further explained that the former minister had procured a jaguar car from Nigeria and used it for some years after which he sent it as a gift to a relation in the United States.\n\nHe said, \u201cUS Customs erroneously impounded the car mistaking it as a stolen car and an emission control infringement as cars with European and African emission control specifications cannot be used in the USA.\u201d\n\nHe said he made the details of the purchase available to the US authorities, who reached out to the car dealer in Nigeria, and later apologised to him upon which it was released to him and he subsequently brought the car back to Nigeria.\n\nKachikwu also debunked the claim that some N9.7 billion was found in his First Bank account, insisting that while he maintained a domiciliary account, the statement put out a false transaction of N9.7 billion inside a dollar domiciliary account.\n\nThe minister, therefore, demanded that the publishers pay him N3 billion compensation, retract the story and desist from further similar, defamatory publication and tender an unreserved apology to be published in five national dailies.\n\nThe letter said failure to adhere to the demands within seven days, the former minister would be left with no other option than to seek legal redress.\n\nMeanwhile, First Bank Nigeria PlC, has faulted the accuracy of the details provided by the online publication.\n\nA letter written to the minister in response to the status of the account with regard to the publication did not emanate from the bank.\n\nThe letter obtained by THISDAY and signed by Rotimi Akinbode and Janice Aleto, said the published bank statements did not reflect the true state of the accounts.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cWe refer to your email of August 24 in which you attached court statements purportedly belonging to you that were published by an online blog and requested us to confirm whether the statements reflect the true statement of your account with our bank.\n\n\u201cHaving reviewed the statement, we wish to state that the account numbers quoted are your visa infinite card and US dollar account with First Bank. However, the statements are not in line with those issued by First Bank and did not emanate from us. They do not reflect the true state of your accounts and are therefore false.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "MaxAB, an Egyptian eCommerce platform that serves food and grocery retailers, has raised an additional $15M from existing investors bringing its total Series A funding to $55M, the largest ever by an Egyptian startup.\n\nIn addition, it announced its acquisition of WaystoCap, a Morocco-based e-commerce and distribution platform that connects retailers with suppliers across Africa.\n\nFounded in 2015 by Niama El Bassunie, Mehdi Daoui, Anis Abdeddine and Aziz Jaouhari Tissafi, WaystoCap was originally a cross-border trade platform for transacting business goods in Africa. Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. It later pivoted to a model similar to MaxAB\u2019s own, pulling out of Ivory Coast and Togo to focus on growing its network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco.\n\nThe acquisition will see MaxAB accelerate its expansion into the Maghreb market \u2013 Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 empowered by WaystoCap\u2019s expertise in the region.\n\nWaystoCap is the second African YC-backed company to exit over the past year after Paystack got acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last October.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take the food and grocery industry to another level in North Africa,\u201d Co-Founder and CEO at MaxAB, Belal El-Megharbel, said on the company\u2019s expansion and the synergies with WaystoCap.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this new super-team, combining a powerhouse of talent, technological know-how, on the ground infrastructure, boosted supply chains and WaystoCap\u2019s phenomenal experience of the region is very exciting.\u201d\n\nMaxAB\u2019s acquisition will now see more than 70,000 retailers supplied with essential food and groceries across multiple markets.\n\nNiama El Bassunie, CEO & Founder of WaystoCap who will take on the position of the managing director at MaxAB Morocco added: \u201cWe are thrilled to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team being created and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.\u201d\n\nFor MaxAB, the Maghreb market is a new territory and this new strategic acquisition will position the expanded team to be North Africa\u2019s leading business-to-business eCommerce platform for retailers and suppliers.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "With less than two years to the 2023 general election in Nigeria, there have been increased debates in recent times on who should succeed incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari when his tenure expires.\n\nWhile some stakeholders and political leaders have spoken in favour of zoning the presidency to the Southern region, considering that President Buhari hails from Northern Nigeria, others have also said region or state should not be the yardstick in electing Nigeria leader in 2023. They say competency should rather be the yardstick for electing Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nSuch was the case recently, when former military leader, Ibrahim Babagida said the country\u2019s next president should be able to speak to Nigerians, understand the economy, and have friends in every region.\n\nPerhaps the quest to fulfilling that dream and bridging that gap in giving the country a leader that is detribalised, purposeful, visionary and nationally accepted informs the move by Ezekiel Eya-Etok, director-general, Nigeria first project and steering committee member National Consultative Forum (NCF), to initiate a process aimed at recruiting a credible, acceptable and responsive leader for the nation in 2023 to challenge the candidates of the two major parties.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on Channels TV breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily, recently, Eya-Etok faulted the leadership recruitment process in the country, saying that the process initiated by his group would lead to the emergency of a credible presidential candidate in 2023.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Who will rebuild Nigeria?\n\nEya-Etok revealed that the process would be open to all Nigerians to nominate individuals irrespective of tribe, state or ethnic group that could lead the country, adding that the nominated individuals would later be prune down by eminent Nigerians to 40 from each geo-political zones, while they would be brought together for Nigerians to engage them.\n\n\u201cNational conservative front is a platform that would bring every Nigerian to say who do you think can be the president in 2023? We would have entries nominated by Nigerians and eminent Nigerians would see the nominated names and bring out 40 from geo-political zones. We bring them together to get Nigerians engaged with them\u201d, Eya-Etok said.\n\nThere is the need for Nigeria to change the status quo and approach towards the leadership recruitment process because the current method has failed the country, he said.\n\nUntil the best people are elected into public offices poor governance across Nigeria would linger, he said, saying in view of the present state of the country Nigerians must be meticulous in choosing who they cast their vote for in 2023.\n\nAccording to Eya-Etok, \u201cI want to appeal to concerned Nigerians who are nationalists, these are people who know that there is a line between governance and politics. Politics is the process that takes you to the governance platform. When you get on the governance platform, which is the management of the people, you can\u2019t but be professional to get the desired result.\n\n\u201cIf you get a non-pilot into a cockpit that aircraft may crash, but if you get a pilot into an aircraft he would know how to stabilise the aircraft.\n\n\u201cGovernance is not what you dash people, either at the local government or any level you recruit the best, it is like a bank. You recruit people to manage the resource for the general interest of all. And if we have this in mind the process that we look is the recruitment process of our leaders,\u201d he stated.",

It is our collective responsibility to take care of children whose parents cannot provide for their daily feeding.\u201d\n\nHe further called for an extension of school hours for children in primary schools across the state, noting that it will improve the gains recorded by the Edo Basic Education Section Transformation (EdoBEST) in the last three years.\n\nObaseki stated that extending the school closing time by one hour will increase the teacher-pupil contact, give the pupils more time to learn and cover the school curriculum, noting, \u201cThe extension of school closing time by one more hour will give the children more time for learning and to cover the school curriculum especially as the COVID-19 pandemic had made us lose so much time in the last one year.\u201d\n\nHe said through the deployment of technology, the state government has been able to monitor progress made by over 270,000 children in public schools across the state, adding that his administration will leverage on the use of ICT to strengthen the Ministry of Education with the support of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) to track and monitor the development and learning process of children irrespective of the school they attend.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith the introduction of EdoBEST, we have changed the culture of our classroom by simplifying the curriculum to make learning fun and easy through the deployment of technology. The change was made possible through the support of Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), teachers and parents.\n\n\u201cWe have succeeded because we have decided to gather our limited resources to improve infrastructure in our schools. We have built more than 204 classrooms while renovating over 9,000 others, as it is now comfortable for our children.

When the vaccines came to Nigeria, I signified interest in taking the vaccine, I took it along with my wife, and nothing has happened to me or my wife. I have continued to encourage my friends to come out and get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nIze-Iyamu continued: \u201cI urge Edo citizens to seize the opportunity created by the Edo State Government and get vaccinated. This is the time to take it when there is no rush because a time is coming when we will beg and fight for it.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the government for making it available and encouraging us to take it. I encourage you all to go and take it; the vaccine is good and safe.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Parish Priest of St. Peter Catholic Church Ugbor, Very Rev. Fr. Stephen Okojie, noted: \u201cWe are happy that we have vaccines now to defeat this pandemic; the rumour about the vaccines is not true. We took vaccines while growing up, there is no issue with vaccination against the COVID-19 pandemic. I am fully vaccinated; I have taken my two doses and we have over 60 percent of parishioners here already vaccinated. We have been preaching about it and encouraging our people to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate what the governor is doing and the level of acceptance by the people. Preachers should stop discouraging people from being vaccinated; if they don\u2019t want to be vaccinated they should allow their people who want to be vaccinated to do so.\n\nOn her part, Uabor applauded the Christian faithful for accepting the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe acceptance rate by Christians across churches visited today is tremendous and encouraging.

The Plateau Economic and Investment Summit earlier scheduled for the 1st and 2nd of September 2021 has been postponed. A new date will be announced and communicated to all our invitees. We apologise for any inconveniences this postponement might cause.\n\n\u201cWe are facing a very difficult moment and we must work together to overcome. There is an obvious plan by those who desire to see Plateau in perpetual crises to employ all divisive methods to achieve their objectives. We must not allow them to use politics, religion, and ethnicity to divert our attention from their criminal activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy determination as your governor is to ensure that I encourage all citizens to embrace one another and use peaceful means to settle any disagreement.\n\n\u201cI shall continue to ensure that we build the capacities of our security agencies including the Operation Rainbow, the newly trained three thousand vigilantes, as well as our traditional institutions to be able to respond promptly and effectively to criminals so that we can enjoy peace and tranquillity.\n\n\u201cFinally, I call on all citizens of Plateau State to work in synergy and promote the long-standing ideals of accommodation, tolerance, love, hardwork godliness and forgiveness which we are known for Plateau State remains the Home of Peace and Tourism.\n\n\u201cGod bless Plateau State and the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has blamed climate change for what he called \u201cfarmers/herders clashes,\u201d a reference to attacks carried out by herdsmen in Plateau, Benue and other parts of the country, while slamming the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) for \u201cunleashing terror on the South-East and parts of the South-South,\u201d describing them as thieves and terrorists.\n\nBuhari who said this in a statement by his media aide Garba Shehu on Sunday, maintained that to achieve success, communities must unite against these horrific attacks, saying retributive violence was not the answer.\n\nHe challenged religious, traditional, and community leaders on the need to preach peace and preventing violence.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dAttempts to simplify the reasons into a basic narrative may help raise donor-dollars for international NGOs, fill pages of overseas newspapers and burnish foreign politicians\u2019 faith credentials. But this does not increase understanding, nor offer solutions. If anything, simplistic theorising and finger-pointing make the situation worse.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cit is important both for Nigerians and the international community to appreciate that there are\u201d a multitude of factors responsible for the worsening insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nBuhari, according to News Agency of Nigeria, further explained that \u201cthere are no religious connotations at all when the primary purpose of these acts is to extract money.\u201d\n\nThe president insisted that the \u201cherder-farmer\u201d violent conflict was a matter of \u201cwater and land,\u201d not religion.\n\n\u201cThen the herder-farmer clashes. While international voices and some Nigerian politicians who seek personal gains from division declare this a matter of religion, for those involved, it is almost entirely a matter of access to water and land,\u201d he stated. \u201cHerders have moved their cattle into contact with farmers for millennia. But increasingly, due to population pressure, escalating aridity of northern states, and climate change, they are forced to travel further south to find grazing lands.\u201d\n\nOn the activities of IPOB, Mr Buhari noted that \u201cfurther afield in the South-East, IPOB are not struggling for freedom when they attack police stations and property, but rather committing acts of terrorism\u201d to steal money.\n\n\u201cIPOB is not defending Christians, as their highly paid foreign lobbyists claim,\u201d Mr Buhari pointed out, \u201cwhen almost every citizen of those states they terrorize is uniformly Christian.\u201d\n\nA few months ago, Mr Buhari\u2019s regime repatriated IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu from Kenya, and now facing various criminal charges in court. He is in detention. Mr Kanu and IPOB are seeking the secession of the South-East from Nigeria.\n\nHowever, Mr Buhari has urged Nigerians to be united against \u201cthose who seek to divide us for their own nefarious financial and political gain, NAN reported.",

          "title": "H1 2021: Zenith Bank dazzles at the top",
          "text": "Peter Okorie\n\nZenith Bank Plc , one of the largest financial institutions by assets has defied the odds to post a profit before tax (PBT) of N117.05 billion for six months as of June 30, against N114.12 billion achieved in the comparative period of 2020.\n\nThis was stated in the company\u2019s interim report signed by the Company Secretary, Mr. Micheal Otu, posted on the website of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Ltd. on Friday in Lagos.\n\nAccording to the result, gross earnings of the Group stood at N345.55 billion for the period under review, as against N346.08 billion reported in the comparative period of 2020.\n\nAlso, profit after tax (PAT) grew from N106.11 billion recorded as of June 30, whereas N103.82 billion was posted in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nThe result also showed company\u2019s income tax expense of N10.94 billion for the period under review, against N10.29 billion recorded in 2020.\n\nAlso, basic, and diluted earnings per share of the bank stand at N3.38 in the period under review, while N3.30 was recorded in the same period of 2020.\n\nAccording to the result, the Board of Directors proposed an interim dividend of 30 kobo per share, the same as the 2020.\n\nIt explained that the decision would be presented for ratification by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe resilience reflected clearly in the bank\u2019s impressive results for the first quarter ended 31st March 2021, with Profit Before Tax (PBT) rising by 4% to N61.0 billion, compared to N58.8 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nAccording to the unaudited statement of account presented to the publicon Friday, 30th April 2021, Profit After Tax (PAT) also grew by 5% from N50.5 billion in Q1 2020 to N53.1 billion in Q1 2021, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe profitability, the Bank said, was driven by the optimisation of the cost of funds and improvement in non-interest income. The Bank\u2019s cost of funds reduced significantly from 2.6% in March 2020 to 1.1% in March 2021. This was also reflected in interest expense which dropped by 45% from N32.8 billion to N18.0 billion over the same period. Non-interest income increased by 10% from N46.6 billion to N51.2 billion, driven by growth in credit-related fees and fees on electronic products.\n\nNon-interest income was boosted by the increase in fees and commission income, which resulted from the increased volume of transactions across all the Bank\u2019s channels. Cost of risk dropped from 0.6% in March 2020 to 0.5% in March 2021, which affirms the Bank\u2019s prudent risk management, even as gross loans increased by 2% from N2.92 trillion to N2.98 trillion in Q1 2021.\n\nThis, in addition to qualitative customer services have remained the attraction to the bank which has carted away many awards over the years. Analysts believe that Zenith bank has remained unbeatable given its antecedents, drive and focus.\n\nCommenting on the banks\u2019 impressive performance, Managing Director of High Cap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adonri, told Business Hallmark that the management of Zenith Bank has not only continued to be focused but that it has also utilized the advantages of technology and digital incursions to push its operations, especially in this Covid-19 period.\n\nRecently, the bank recorded an addition to its many laurels, emerging the Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021.\n\nAccording to the July 2021 edition of the World Finance Magazine, the rank was based on individual banks\u2019 ability to adapt to a continually evolving technological environment while maintaining top-class customer relations and bolstering their financial footing amidst the upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis comes barely two weeks after the tier 1 lender emerged as the best lender in the West African sub-region, according to data released by the Banker Magazine, a subsidiary of the Financial Times Group.\n\nEarlier in June, Zenith Bank, for the second consecutive year, was named as the Best Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. The award, which was published in the June 2021 edition of The Ethical Boardroom magazine, was in recognition of the bank\u2019s adherence to global best practices and institutionalization of corporate governance, setting an industry-wide example of best practices in that field.\n\nIt has been award and recognition galore for the bank in recent times driven by its track record of excellent performance and commitment to global best practices. Zenith Bank was voted as Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nAlso, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, and Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2020 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine among many others.\n\nZenith Bank has been generally adjudged a Corporate Governance compliant bank by the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), hence its listing on the Premium Board of the Exchange. The bank continues to sustain this reputation and reappraise its processes to ensure that its business conforms to the highest global standards at all times.\n\nWith its core business strategy anchored on People, Technology and Service, the bank leverages robust Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure to provide cutting-edge solutions and products through its network of branches and electronic/digital channels to create value for its numerous clientele.\n\nWorld Finance is a leading international magazine providing comprehensive coverage and analysis of the financial industry, international business and the global economy.\n\nThe editorial combines award-winning reportage, covering a broad range of topics from banking and insurance to wealth management and infrastructure investment, with contributions from some of the world\u2019s most well-respected economists and theorists as well as consultants in government think tanks and the World Economic Forum.\n\n,",

Those who sit in the front row of the church can testify that in the last two years, he was shaking even while in the chair.\n\n\u201cSome days ago when he finished preaching I had to rush from my seat to come and help him back to his seat because he could not move, check your videos , you know Papa very well, for him not to read the Bible, he is a walking word. That he couldn\u2019t read the Bible! When you watch your videos of clips recorded in the church, you will see the signs.\n\nShe added that, \u201cTwo Saturdays ago, I could not keep him at home, he wanted to come and lead prayers. Those of you brothers who gather to hold him in the church every Saturday, you can testify that something was wrong, you see me always coming to interrupt you and always saying enough.\u201d\n\nA professor who was taking care of him asked him to stop preaching , he was feeling for me, he would say, Mama they would drag your name, they would say you have taken over, allow me to be there. He was protecting me, that\u2019s why he kept coming to church to preach. So that people will not say I took over the church.",

          "text": "Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has called on presidential aides to stop what it described as discriminatory response to terror attacks in the region.\n\nMBF said the gabble of a response signed by the presidential spokesman, Mr Garba Shehu, over the interview Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State granted Channels Television was unfortunate.\n\nIn a statement issued by the MBF president, Bitrus Pogu, the group said, it was irrefutable that while the Benue State governor came out speaking truth to those living in self-denial, it found it incompressible and strange why Mr Shehu refused to speak on issues raised by the governor but resorted to accusing Ortom of attempting to incite genocidal attacks against the Fulani.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe MBF stated that the indelible footprints of Governor Ortom on our nation\u2019s political sands speak of a patriot who is not afraid to speak when it matters the most, adding that watching the interview, Dr Ortom made no pretences over the real problems confronting Nigeria.\n\nIt said true to his character, the governor has never left anyone in doubt as to his position on national issues, especially on matters relating to insecurity and the urgency required in tackling the myriad of tragedies ripping across Nigeria caused by armed herdsmen, unlike some state chief executives who would prefer to remain silent in the face of existential threats.\n\nThe group stated that the embarrassing silence and discriminatory disposition by the federal government over the intentional obliteration of their communities and massive massacre of their people must be brought to an end, adding that the Buhari-led government must stop its discrimination in the manner it reacts to terror attacks on other groups and take swift actions against perpetrators. It noted that the governor is not an instigator of violence, but a patriot who can\u2019t keep silent in the face of glaring multiple injustices and destruction of communities, saying Ortom ought to be praised for what he stands for and not to be vilified by a biased presidential spokesman that is living in self-denial.\n\nIt asserted that in our democracy that is fraught with subdued silence for fear of higher political forces, Governor Ortom remains a symbol of hope for a nation whose democratic leaders have remained impotent in speaking out against unprovoked murders and premeditated decimation of communities in the country, especially in the Middle Belt region.\n\n\u201cAs someone who is in his second and final term as governor, the presidency needs to be reminded that Dr Ortom remains a popular political leader in Benue State, and that it was that popularity that earned him a second term despite ploys by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to truncate his comeback bid in 2019. That he is still the governor of Benue State today is a clear demonstration that he carries the flame of overwhelming acceptability that was freely given through the ballot by the electorate in Benue,\u201d it said.",

Retributice violence is not the answer. \u201cWhile these troubled communities are being reinforced with security personnel, our religious, traditional and other community leaders must not allow the use of use of their spaces for the propagation of violence and incitement to violence.\n\n\n\n\u201cAttempts to simplify the reasons into a basic narrative may help raise donor-dollars for international NGOs, fill pages of overseas newspapers, and burnish foreign politicians\u2019 faith credentials: but this does not increase understanding, nor offer solutions. If anything, simplistic theorising and finger-pointing makes the situation worse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is important both for Nigerians and the international community to appreciate that there are a multitude of factors attendant to these troubles.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorism, as well as the spate of kidnappings for ransom, transformed by some misinformed global media into a Muslim-on-Christian threat. Yet, in reality, there are no religious connotations at all when the primate purpose of these acts is to extract money.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen the herder-farmer clashes. While international voices and some Nigerian politicians who seek personal gain from division declare this a matter of religion, for those involved it is almost entirely a matter of access to water and land. Herders have moved their cattle and into contact with farmers for millennia. But, increasingly, due to population pressure, the increased aridity of northern states, and climate change they are forced to travel further south to find grazing lands.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen, further afield in the south-East, IPOB are not struggling for freedom when they attack police stations and property, but rather committing acts of terrorism in order to steal money. IPOB is not defending Christians \u2013 as their highly-paid foreign lobbyists claim \u2013 when almost every citizen of those the states they terrorize is uniformly Christian. Yet mistakenly, and because the lobbyists for IPOB have duped them, some misguided foreign media and politicians believe it so.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs for Nigerians, what we need is to come together. And we must do this firstly and for the most part by our own hands, by casting asunder those who seek to divide us for their own nefarious financial and political gain.\u201d",

          "text": "Association of Shop Owners in Area 7 Abuja in a bid to protect the investments of its members has called on the FCT minister to intervene and revert the purported demolition of the area 7 UTC Shopping complex by Abuja Investment Company Limited under the guise of remodeling the complex.\n\nIn a joint meeting held with the Abuja Markets Management Limited, the association \u201cdemanded proof that the Abuja Investments Company Limited are the owners of the complex.\u201d Despite promises made by Abuja Markets Management Limited to get answers from its parent body, nothing has been heard of to date.\n\n\u201cWe have so much at stake in this enterprise and totally ignoring us as the Management is currently doing is tantamount to stretching our resilience beyond limits. It\u2019s on this premise we resolved to offer the following prayers to the Minister of FCT for his prompt intervention.\n\n\u201cWe pray that this very unusual plan by Management is rescinded for now especially at this trying time in the economic life of this nation. And that prompts us to ask the salient question; who owns Urban Shelter, and why is it being used as a veiled instrument to dispossess law-abiding citizens of their legitimate properties? We wish to state also that the complex was not built as a shopping mall; rather as a safe haven for the struggling masses especially retired civil servants to thrive in whatever business they choose to embark on.\n\n\u201cThe market; we that are there say is overbuilt as three other shopping malls and plazas are gradually turning the only road running through the complexes a motorists nightmare. Erecting a completely new structure in the vicinity would further worsen the already bad situation. It is hereby suggested that the complex and UTC Block be given a facelift, instead,\u201d a statement signed by its Chairman, Godfrey Ojarikre reads.\n\nThe association explained that If the remodeling must take place; all stakeholders must be accommodated as partners in progress on the negotiation table.\n\n\u201cThis presupposes that every Shop Owner would be offered the first right of refusal over any new allocation. Moreover; the modalities geared towards the full and successful implementation of any new project would be jointly addressed by all stakeholders.\n\nThe Association recalled that the Federal Capital Development Authority had in the year 1992, allocated spaces to the citizens of FCT, adding that in 1997, letters of reconfirmation of allocated spaces.\n\nIt also noted that the Abuja Investment Company Limited came into existence in 2008 and has taken several steps including sending letters of termination, most of which it said, it ignored because the Investment Company was not responsible for issuance in the first place.\n\n\u201cFurther to our earlier oral and written representation to the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council that was mandated by the Permanent Secretary to investigate the circumstances surrounding threats by the Abuja Investments Company Limited. to Remodel the Area 7 Shopping Complex / UTC, we hereby make our final submission as follows;\n\n\u201cIn the year 1992; the Federal Capital Development Authority allocated shops/space to Four Hundred and Seventy One citizens of the FCT majority of who were retired civil servants. In 1997 a letter of reconfirmation of allocation of shop/space was issued with directives to not only enter into a tenancy agreement with the FCT Market Management Committee, but convert the shop space to permanent structures in accordance with the approved prototype design which was attached and that the conversion would be supervised by authorized professionals. The allotment was duly supervised and the shops built by individuals with hard earned monies derived from loans, pensions and gratuities\n\n\u201cThe Abuja Investments Company Limited and the Abuja Markets Management Limited came into existence in 2008 and in line with the oppressive style of leadership in the affairs of the FCT then, a notice of termination of tenancy was issued on the 16th July 2008. We remained unperturbed over the notice because it was not from the Authority that allocated the shops to us in the first place,\u201d the statement added\n\nThis, the statement said, was followed by a Letter of Offer for a Five Year Lease on March 30th, 2009, and finally, a Letter of Offer for Tenancy was issued on 30th June 2013, six months short of the Five Year Lease agreement, which is still operational till date.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place on good authority that we constituted ourselves into an Association in early 2009 and we were duly registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission. Moreover; Management has over the years been addressing us by our registered name. All Shop Owners have been consistent in their payment of Ground Rent to the Abuja Investments Company Limited; and Service Charge to the Abuja Markets Management Limited from January; 2009 till date. And that lawfully confers on every Shop Owner the statutory right of ownership.\u201d",

          "text": "Rockets were fired at Kabul\u2019s airport on Monday where US troops were racing to complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan and evacuate allies under the threat of Islamic State group attacks.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has set a deadline of Tuesday to withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan, drawing to a close his nation\u2019s longest military conflict, which began in retaliation for the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe return of the hardline Islamist Taliban movement, which was toppled in 2001 but took back power a fortnight ago, triggered an exodus of terrified people aboard US-led evacuation flights.\n\nThose flights, which have taken more than 120,000 people out of Kabul airport, will officially end on Tuesday when the last of the thousands of American troops pull out.\n\nBut US forces are now focused chiefly on flying themselves and American diplomats out safely.\n\nThe Islamic State group, rivals of the Taliban, pose the biggest threat to the withdrawal after carrying out a suicide bomb attack at the perimeter of the airport late last week that claimed more than 100 lives, including those of 13 US troops.\n\nBiden had warned more attacks were highly likely and the United States said it carried out an air strike on Sunday night in Kabul on an IS-prepared car bomb.\n\nThat was followed on Monday morning by rockets being fired at the airport.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t sleep\u2019\n\nThe White House confirmed there had been a rocket attack directed at the airport, but said operations there were \u201cuninterrupted\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2026 has reconfirmed his order that commanders redouble their efforts to prioritise doing whatever is necessary to protect our forces on the ground,\u201d the White House statement said.\n\nAn AFP photographer on Monday took images of a destroyed car with a launcher system still visible in the back seat.\n\nA suspected US drone strike had hit the car, about two kilometres (1.2 miles) from the airport.\n\nA Taliban official at the scene said he believed five rockets had been fired, and all were destroyed by the airport\u2019s missile defence systems.\n\nWhile there were no reports of fatalities or airport damage from the rocket attacks, they caused greater anxieties for locals already traumatised by years of war.\n\n\u201cSince the Americans have taken control of the airport, we can\u2019t sleep properly,\u201d Abdullah, who lives near the airport and gave only one name, told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt is either gun firing, rockets, sirens or sounds of huge planes that disturb us. And now that they are being directly targeted, it can put our lives in danger.\u201d\n\n\u2018Potential loss of innocent life\u2019\n\nThe United States said the air strike on Sunday night on the car bomb had eliminated another threat from the Islamic State jihadists.\n\nHowever, it may have also have killed civilians.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today,\u201d Captain Bill Urban, a US Central Command spokesman, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe would be deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the Islamic State\u2019s Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.\n\nThey have massacred civilians at mosques, public squares, schools, and even hospitals.\n\nWhile both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamists, they are bitter foes \u2014 with each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.\n\nLast week\u2019s suicide bombing at the airport led to the worst single-day death toll for the US military in Afghanistan since 2011.\n\nThe IS threat has forced the US military and the Taliban to co-operate in ensuring security at the airport in a way unthinkable just weeks ago.\n\nOn Saturday, Taliban fighters escorted a steady stream of Afghans from buses to the main passenger terminal, handing them over to US forces for evacuation.\n\nTaliban leader\n\nThe Taliban have promised a softer brand of rule compared with their first stint in power, which the US military ended because the group gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda.\n\nBut many Afghans fear a repeat of the Taliban\u2019s brutal interpretation of Islamic law, as well as violent retribution for working with foreign militaries, Western missions or the previous US-backed government.\n\nWestern allies have warned many thousands of at-risk Afghans have not been able to get on the evacuation flights.\n\nOn Sunday, the Taliban revealed their supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada was in southern Afghanistan and planning to make a public appearance.\n\n\u201cHe is present in Kandahar. He has been living there from the very beginning,\u201d said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.\n\nAFP",

If anything, simplistic theorizing and finger-pointing make the situation worse.\n\n\u201cIt is important both for Nigerians and the international community to appreciate that there are a multitude of factors attendant to these troubles.\n\n\u201cThere is the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorism, as well as the spate of kidnappings for ransom, transformed by some misinformed global media into a Muslim-on-Christian threat. Yet, in reality, there are no religious connotations at all when the primary purpose of these acts is to extract money.\n\n\u201cThen the herder-farmer clashes. While international voices and some Nigerian politicians who seek personal gain from division declare this a matter of religion, for those involved, it is almost entirely a matter of access to water and land. Herders have moved their cattle into contact with farmers for millennia. But, increasingly, due to population pressure, escalating aridity of northern states, and climate change, they are forced to travel further south to find grazing lands.\n\n\u201cThen, further afield in the South-east, IPOB are not struggling for freedom when they attack police stations and property, but rather committing acts of terrorism in order to steal money. IPOB is not defending Christians \u2013 as their highly-paid foreign lobbyists claim \u2013 when almost every citizen of those states they terrorize is uniformly Christian. Yet mistakenly, and because the lobbyists for IPOB have duped them, some misguided foreign media and politicians believe so,\u201d the President explained.\n\nHe added that as for Nigerians, what needs be done is to come together and cast asunder those who seek to divide the nation for their own nefarious financial and political gain.",

The boat which was being escorted by 2 speedboats was suspected to be carrying illegally refined oil products in large drums along the Channel in the direction of OPDS patrol boats.\n\n\u201cOn sighting the boat, warning shots were fired to dissuade the crew from hostile action. The crew fired back at the helicopter and the boat was engaged accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe 2 speedboats detached from the convoy at high speed leaving the \u2018Cotonou Boat\u2019 which was neutralized,\u201d General Sawyerr narrated.\n\nHe further disclosed that the helicopter later went after the 2 speedboats but was unable to track it.\n\n\u201cThe suspects are still at large and a manhunt has been sent out to apprehend them,\u201d the DHQ Spokesman added.\n\nAccording to him, the military remains a professional institution that operates in line with best practices through the application of rule of engagement and code of conduct.\n\n\u201cIt is also positioned to protect the populace rather than victimising them. Efforts by anyone to protect criminality by disparaging the actions of the Military in preventing economic sabotage and other sundry crimes need to be condemned by all,\u201d the General\u2019s communique read in part.\n\nHe on behalf of the military urged the general public to disregard any report at variance to what had been detailed.\n\nCitizens were also enjoined to continue providing accurate information to troops that will lead to the attainment of the military\u2019s operational mandate of safeguarding lives, properties as well as government assets in the South-south region.",

Even though they are quickly given ethno-religious connotations, there is no justification for the killing of any human being.\n\n\u201cWe are a society that is guided by rules which do not permit anyone to take the laws into his or her hands no matter the grievances,\u201d the governor said at a press briefing.\n\n\u201cThere is an obvious plan by those who desire to see Plateau in perpetual crises to employ all divisive methods to achieve their objectives. We must not allow them to use politics, religion, and ethnicity to divert our attention from their criminal activities.\n\n\u201cMy determination as your governor is to ensure that I encourage all citizens to embrace one another and use peaceful means to settle any disagreement.\u201d\n\nThe governor also noted that after reviewing certain decisions earlier taken in the wake of the attacks, he has relaxed the curfew in Jos north, Jos south, and Bassa local government areas.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the review, Government took the following decisions: i. The curfew in Jos North is to be relaxed. Beginning from Monday 30th August 2021, the curfew shall be enforced from 6 pm to 6 am until further notice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe curfew in Jos South and Bassa is to also be further relaxed. As from Monday 30th August 2021, the curfew shall be enforced between 10 pm to 6 am until further notice.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Tricycles (Keke NAPEP) and hawkers remains in force within Jos/Bukuru metropolis.\n\n\u201cMy dear citizens, our long term goal is to foster dialogue, collaboration, understanding and proactive dispute resolution mechanisms that will make it difficult for people to resort to criminality in the name of self-help and reprisals whenever there is any disagreement.\n\n\u201cThose who fail to follow lawful means to settle their grievances should be ready for a showdown with government as we will never tolerate killings and destruction of properties under any guise.\n\n\u201cDuring these trying times, I have watched with great disappointment the unfortunate comments and utterances of some citizens including religious, political and community leaders from within and outside the state who rather than calm nerves and join hands with the government to ensure the quick restoration of peace, resorted to pushing out ethno-religious sentiments that further created tensions.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "title": "Nigeria: Again, Katsina Governor Masari Canvasses for State Police",
          "text": "For the umpteenth time, the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has said if the country truly intended to get a hold of the deteriorating security situation, then, it must embrace multi-level policing otherwise called state police.\n\nThe governor, whose state has been under intense fire from bandits and insurgents, reiterated his recent call for the people of Katsina to procure arms and defend themselves and added his government had begun to train people to defend themselves.\n\nWhile decrying the growing insecurity in the country, Masari expressed concern that the number of policemen available to his state was less than 3,000 and therefore not enough to protect the citizens.\n\nMasari, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who spoke in an interview monitored on national television at the weekend, therefore, reiterated his support for state police, saying there was a need for it to be accommodated in the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, working with the Nigeria Police Force, his administration had been training people to defend their villages and communities.\n\n\u201cKnowing full well how long it will take the police to improve its capacity to be able to provide the much-needed security for villages and communities, are you saying people should fold their arms?\n\n\u201cIf somebody slaps you, the natural instinct is to raise your hands up, and if he comes with a stick, you take a stick to protect yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s home state governor disclosed that this week, his government would complete the training of 500 vigilantes, who were trained by the police and armed forces, saying in the coming week, training for another 500 would be completed.\n\nHe said the target was to have 3,000 trained vigilante working with the police and other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe situation we have on ground is such that bandits would come to a village, kidnap and collect over N500,000 from villagers and in some cases get N5 million from them.\n\n\u201cAnd in the same village, when you say come let us contribute and train these vigilantes to defend them at night, they would not give you N20,000,\u201d he said.\n\nLamenting that Katsina, which has an estimated population of between seven and eight million persons, the governor claimed presently has only 3,000 policemen.\n\nDefending his recent call for citizens to defend themselves as the way out of the present situation, Masari argued that the efforts his administration made to achieve peace in his first two years in office could not be sustained because the same wasn\u2019t made in Zamfara and some other neighbouring states at that time.\n\n\u201cI have no regret in what I said (that people should defend themselves). But what is the natural instinct of every living thing? It is to protect himself against events happening around him for him to survive.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a simple scenario. Katsina State as of 2006 had a population of 5.6 million, even if we are growing at three per cent, what would be the population by 2021?\n\n\u201cWe are projecting a population of seven to eight million. Now, what is the total strength of the police in Katsina? The total strength of the police in the state is not up to 3,000. So, if you divide the number of policemen by the population, you have an average of one policeman to over 200,000 people. What form of ammunition does the policemen have?\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, Masari explained that, in his state, a local government with 34 policemen, had over 300 villages and towns to secure.\n\n\u201cThey (police) lack logistics in terms of equipment to move around, they lack the necessary weapons and above all, they lack the technology.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the military, how many are they in Katsina? The military is in all the states of the country, what equipment and level of technology are they applying? Look, when you are faced with reality of daily killings, daily kidnappings, daily raping and daily cattle rustling, you will understand. In Katsina, we wake up every day to these realities,\u201d Masari added.\n\nLending his support for the anti-open grazing legislation, the president\u2019s governor said, his state had a ranching programme that would cost about N12.5 billion, out of which the federal government already supported it with 50 per cent, while the state would provide 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cWhen we were growing up we had community grazing areas, where you take your sheep, goat and cattle to graze, without going to other people\u2019s farm,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe, therefore, advocated that, \u201cWe should stop open-grazing; it is causing trouble,\u201d adding that, \u201cAnybody living in the forest, for me, is a criminal.\u201d\n\nAbout a week ago, the seemingly helpless security situation in Katsina had caused two members of the state House of Assembly to publicly shed tears while deliberating on the worsening state of insecurity in the state.\n\nDuring the plenary presided over by the Speaker, Alhaji Tasi\u2019u Maigari, the Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Shehu Dalhatu-Tafoki, in a motion of urgent public importance, decried how despite government and security agencies\u2019 efforts, the insecurity situation in the state seems to be increasing.\n\nDalhatu-Taofiki, urged the government in conjunction with security agencies, to adopt a new approach and also increase the number of outposts, especially, in the affected areas to tame the menace of banditry in the state.\n\n\u201cThe security operative need to increase their outposts across the state, especially, in the areas mostly disturbed by the bandits. The outposts in those areas are not enough; they cannot overpower the bandits, despite the huge amounts of money being spent on them,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAlso, reacting to the motion, Alhaji Haruna Goma, a member representing Dandume Constituency, could not hold back his tears as he narrated how the cruel bandits wasted the lives of not less than 11 persons and abducted scores in Dandume recently.\n\nSimilarly, Alhaji Abubakar Mohammed, a member representing Funtua constituency, equally wept why recounting how the hoodlums terrorised their communities in the last one month, killing and kidnapping scores.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the insecurity challenge plaguing the state was unimaginable, because about 32 out of the 34 LGAs in the state were now being threatened by the bandits.\n\nIn May, Deputy Speaker of the state, Shehu Tafoki, had also cried profusely while talking about rising insecurity in his constituency. He broke down in tears during a special sitting on insecurity by the Assembly.\n\nHe said hardly did a day go by without reported attacks across the area, adding that many had been killed, maimed and kidnapped.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "title": "Concerns Mount as Court Injunctions, Orders Threaten Nigeria\u2019s Democracy: THISDAY",
          "text": "The increasing meddlesome interventions of the judiciary in almost every stratum of the political turf is fast threatening Nigeria\u2019s hard-earned democracy and becoming a source of concern to stakeholders, especially, as the country moves closer to the 2023 elections, a THISDAY says.\n\nFrom Port Harcourt to Kebbi and then, Calabar as seen in the past few days in the Peoples Democratic (PDP) as well as events leading to the Anambra gubernatorial election, stakeholders are worried that the trend signposts possible dangers ahead, even as they rebuked members of the judiciary for making themselves readily available for the dirty biddings of politicians.\n\nThe courts, many well-meaning Nigerians are worried, might have become a marketplace for politicians to buy injunctions and exparte orders, and at the rate things are going, it may be difficult to draw the lines that Judges will not cross just to do the bidding of politicians.\n\nThe ease with which judges allow themselves to be manipulated by senior lawyers in pursuit of narrow self-interest is baffling to many, who now see the judiciary as a major threat to the nation\u2019s democracy. Some of the actions of judges defy logic and reason causing the layman on the street to ask questions and raise suspicion of underhand dealings.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now embarrassing. It is now so easy for any group to move into any court to get a judgment. All they need do is to get a pliant judge. It is unfortunate that the judges are the ones that determine, who holds political positions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are so many interventions by the judiciary across the country. They make governors, senators; they issue injunctions and they now sell injunctions. You have a case in Akwa Ibom, you go to Sokoto to get a judgment and then INEC has to obey. So, it is an abuse. With the way they are going, you can even get an injunction for marriages in Jigawa,\u201d a senior lawyer, who pleaded to remain anonymous, said.\n\nFor instance, in the PDP, early last week, a High Court in Rivers State, had issued an order of interim injunction, restraining Uche Secondus from carrying on as national chairman of the party, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office.\n\nSecondus, according to the ruling, had been ordered to stop parading himself as a member of the PDP on grounds of his suspension from the party.\n\nJustice O. Gbasam of the Degema Division of a High Court of Rivers State, sitting in Port Harcourt, had issued the orders while delivering ruling in an exparte application by some chieftains of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nBut two days after, Justice Nusirat. I. Umar, a vacation Judge of the Kebbi State High Court of coordinate jurisdiction with the one in Rivers State and who was clearly aware of the case already in Rivers State, not only entertained the case, she gave her own orders restoring the embattled National Chairman of the party to his position.\n\nThis was after the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Party, Elder Yemi Akinwomi, had assumed leadership of the PDP in an acting capacity.\n\nIn a suit brought before her in Birinin Kebbi, the state capital in case KB/AC/M. 170/2021, Justice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affidavit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable court granting leave to the first respondent (Uche Secondus) to continue exercising all the constitutional powers of the office of Chairman of PDP (second defendant) as enshrined in both 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended and the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s constitution pending the hearing and final determination of applicant\u2019s motion on notice,\u201d the order stated.\n\nRegrettably, 24-hours after the Kebbi State ruling, the crisis in the political party took a new twist as this time another court in Calabar, Cross River State, further restrained Secondus from parading himself as chairman as well as from presiding over the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party held at the weekend.\n\nAny right-thinking person will know that something was surely wrong with a system that tolerates such abuse and mockery of such a critical arm of the state. But Judges and many senior lawyers appear to care less about the consequential implications of their behaviour, which had brought disrepute and dishonour to the judiciary.\n\nThe interim order was issued by the court, presided over by Justice Edem Kufre, last Friday, upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani.\n\nThe situation is not different in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), which had also been engulfed with leadership squabble between the Jude Okeke and Victor Oye factions. This has seen leaders of the same party move from one court to the other shopping for an injunction in their quest to control the party and ensure their candidates are recognised ahead of the November gubernatorial election, thus further polarizing the party.\n\nIn the case of the APGA, former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Chukwuma Soludo is having a running battle with Chukwuma Umeoji. The litigations are tied to who is the authentic Chairman of APGA in Anambra State amongst Chief Victor Oye, Chief Njoku and Jude Okeke.\n\nMeanwhile, judges in Anambra, Jigawa, Imo and Abuja have intervened in the matter causing INEC to at various times list and delist both the names of Soludo and Umeoji as candidates of APGA.\n\nThe electoral umpire had on July 16 published the name of Umeoji as the APGA candidate following an order by the Jigawa State High Court on June 28.\n\nOn July 18 justice Charles Okaa of Anambra State High Court directed INEC to publish Soludo\u2019s name as APGA\u2019s candidate. Meanwhile, justice Iheka of the Imo State High Court again ordered INEC to publish Umeoji\u2019s name.\n\nReacting to the confusion, Justice Nwosu-Iheme berated the judges for indulging politicians, who go round the country shopping for judgments to enable them to be on the ballot. According to her, the judges, who indulge these politicians are bringing the legal profession to public ridicule.\n\nThe PDP in Anambra State is in a terrible position as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) presently does not recognise either the Valentine Ozigbo or Senator Ugochukwu Uba factions, because of a plethora of court injunctions.\n\nA former National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Adams Oshiomhole, was also removed after legal fireworks that saw the former labour leader and his then rivals from the Federal High Court in Kano, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, among others, in the battle for the soul of the party.\n\nSome three weeks ago, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) warned that except the leadership of both the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and the National Judicial Council (NJC) intervened, the seemingly endless and conflicting court orders over political parties\u2019 affairs could jeopardise preparations for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC, which lamented the level of distraction the commission had begun to face as a result of litigations arising from the Anambra State governorship primary elections, however, restated its commitment to the use of technology in conducting elections, because it was the only way to credible and transparent polls.\n\nWhile maintaining that new and conflicting court orders from all parts of the country kept flooding its headquarters on a daily basis, the commission said it was not only frustrating but also causing it to keep recognising one candidate over the other, and changing same again in the major political parties.\n\nNational Commissioner for Voter Education, Festus Okoye, who hinted at the concerns in Awka, Anambra State, said, \u201cThis (litigations) is frustrating. What the commission does in terms of obedience to court orders is that if a judgment comes today, the commission obeys the order, because it is the latest in time.\n\n\u201cIf on the same issue, another court of coordinate jurisdiction, or from a court of another judicial division comes to us, because that one is the latest in time, the commission obeys that one.\n\n\u201cSo, what the political parties have been doing, and what they are doing is that they anticipate the commission, and the moment you\u2019re proceeding, they get court orders. This is impeding our performance and making things difficult.\n\n\u201cElections require sanctity and adherence to guidelines, the leadership of the NBA and the NJC should look at this. This is urgent and imperative because if it persists, this can jeopardise the conduct of the 2023 general election. We are having court orders on a daily basis from courts in all parts of the country and that is not right.\u201d\n\nAlthough sections of the country\u2019s constitution and the Electoral Act allow the judiciary, (courts and election tribunals) to intervene particularly, when issues of non-compliance, manipulation, violence etc are alleged to mar the process of electing a particular representative, however, recent developments seem to portray the fact that these days, the judges rather than the people choose the leaders.\n\nA peculiar case in recent times is that of a South Eastern State where the governor was referred to as the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d governor, simply because he was declared winner of the 2019 governorship election, after coming a distant fourth in the poll.\n\nThe intervention of the courts whether at pre-election cases or election petitions are taking a worrisome dimension as their judgments to most aggrieved parties and even the people seem to be far from justice, particularly, when such courts or judges lacked the necessary jurisdiction in the first place to hear the case brought before them.\n\nThe situation was so bad that sometime last year, former Chief Judge of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Justice Ishaq Bello had to issue a practice directive warning justice against delving into cases outside their jurisdiction as well as issuing all sorts of restraining orders in election matters.\n\nBut it seems the warning may have fallen on deaf ears as the situation rather than abating is getting worse. Only recently, a Justice of the Court of Appeal, Chioma Nwosu-Iheme, while delivering judgment called for the punishment of a Jigawa State High Court judge, Justice Ubale and his Imo State counterpart, Justice B. C. Iheka over what she described as professional misconduct by dabbling into the Anambra State gubernatorial election controversy and gave consequential judgments on it.\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
          "summary": "The electoral umpire had on July 16 published the name of Umeoji as the APGA candidate following an order by the Jigawa State High Court on June 28.\nOn July 18 justice Charles Okaa of Anambra State High Court directed INEC to publish Soludo\u2019s name as APGA\u2019s candidate.\nMeanwhile, justice Iheka of the Imo State High Court again ordered INEC to publish Umeoji\u2019s name.\nWhat the commission does in terms of obedience to court orders is that if a judgment comes today, the commission obeys the order, because it is the latest in time.\n\u201cSo, what the political parties have been doing, and what they are doing is that they anticipate the commission, and the moment you\u2019re proceeding, they get court orders.",
