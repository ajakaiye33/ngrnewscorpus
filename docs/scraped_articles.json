          "text": "A former Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, Sam Ohuabunwa, on Monday, declared his intention to run for the office of President in 2023, on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nThe renowned pharmacist and industrialist, who is also the Convener of the New Nigeria Group, unfolded his agenda at a news briefing in Abuja.\n\nOhuabunwa noted that membership of his NNG cuts across other parties, he decided to run on the platform of the PDP because of the party\u2019s internal democratic ethos.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis new direction indicating an enviable reformation was exhibited at its National Convention for the election of Party officials at the end of October 2021, during which it peacefully elected a new and competent crop of national leaders.\n\n\u201cThe PDP in our view has shown that it has learnt some useful lessons during the past 6 years of being in the opposition at the federal level, and seems prepared to correct all mistakes it may have made when it was in power, and to refocus\n\n\u201cGovernance at all levels to the true enhancement of the security, wellbeing and happiness of the citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe that in doing this, the new thinking, the new vision, the new values and the freshness we bring will be in sync with the new mission of the PDP.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, we are fully persuaded that the birth of a new Nigeria, which we espouse will find fulfillment through the platform of the PDP.\u201d\n\nOhuabunwa added that his declaration to run for Presidency has fully debunked the erroneous assertion that no politician from the South East geopolitical zone had shown serious interest in running for the office of President in 2023.\n\nHe said he was seeking to govern the country in 2023 to address the worsening conditions of things, which according to him, seemed more divided than in 1970 after the Civil War, with many retreating into their ethnic enclaves.\n\nHe promised to make Nigeria a country where poverty, low quality of life and joblessness will be vastly eliminated, thereby making Nigeria globally competitive.\n\nOhuabunwa said, under his leadership, law and order would reign supreme and that lives would be sacrosanct while citizens have access to quality education, health care and housing supported by mortgage.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are also convinced that the competence, character and courage we bring to the political leadership will put the party in good stead.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi,(retd.), has said insecurity in the country has assumed a new dimension with the calls for secession by various groups.\n\nHe added that the prevalence of the security threats had adversely affected food security and economic growth in the country.\n\nMagashi spoke at the opening of a retreat for Defence Advisers/Attaches Conference, organised by the Defence Intelligence Agency on Monday in Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cA look at the security challenges in Nigeria today reveals new dimensions with increasing agitations for secession. In the North-East, attacks by Boko Haram Terrorists and the Islamic State in West Africa Province continue to pose serious security threats in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the North-West and North-Central zones, the activities of bandits, armed herders/militia attacks and kidnappers are prevalent.\n\n\u201cThe littoral states in the South-South region are plagued with illegal oil bunkering, piracy and militancy, while the South-East is challenged with secessionist activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra.\n\n\u201cThe South-West region is equally faced with secessionist inclination driven by ethnic agitators, as well as occasional tension between herders and farmers. Distinguishing the threats Nigeria is currently facing and understanding their socio-geographic context is pivotal for adapting appropriate and lasting counter-measures.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the prevalence of these threats has continued to endanger not only national security and economic growth, but food security as well. In particular, food security has been adversely affected with the attendant rise in the prices of food stuff across the country which portends a new dimension of threat. \u201d\n\nHe added that this made it imperative for the various security agencies in the country to continue to collaborate to tackle the menace in order to create an enabling atmosphere for economic activities to thrive and to attract Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nMagashi however, said to support the country\u2019s surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces had recruited over 17,000 personnel, adding that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, had approved the recruitment of 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\nThe National Security Adviser (NSA), retired Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno, said the defence Attach\u00e9s/Advisers were considered as critical stakeholders in surmounting the myriad of security challenges facing Nigeria.\n\nMonguno, who was represented by his Principal General Staff Officer, Maj. Gen. Abubakar Ndalolo, said Nigeria had been adopting both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches in dealing with security challenges, adding that both approaches had been yielding results.\n\nThe Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa (retd.), urged attach\u00e9s to use their position to support the fight against drug abuse and trafficking in Nigeria.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu \u2013 Abuja\n\nString of subdued protests greeted a smart move by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice, Hon. Ugonna Ozurigbo to prevent Abubakar Malami (SAN) from discloing the whereabouts of recovered loots and the actual amount involved.\n\nMalami, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, had appeared before the Committee to defend the ministry\u2019s 2022 budget estimates.\n\nDone with the presentation, some lawmakers took turn to ask questions on the current status and the exact amount of recovered loots.\n\nFirst to speak in that direction was Hon. Chinyere Igwe (PDP, Rivers). He said that the record needed to be set straight on the matter in view of the controversy surrounding its custody.\n\nIgwe also enquired to know why Nigeria was paying hugely on consultancy services on the Paris Club refund.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are trending issues in the Nigeria polity today and one of the issues is the payment of consultancy services for Paris Club. A whopping sum in the region of 400 to 500 million dollars is being paid and I am sure you are aware of that.\n\n\u2018Two, you made reference to the recovery of looted assets. With the successes recorded so far in this regard, Nigerians need to know what has been recovered and where the money has been kept because there has been controversy as to whether the money is with the EFCC and ICPC. Where is this money?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Hon. Ademorin Kuye (APC, Lagos) requested to know why the Ministry of Justice was outsourcing legal services to private lawyers when those in the employ of government can easily take up the responsibilities.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, over N2.5 billion had been expended on legal services.\n\nKuye also asked about the decongestion of Correctional Centres across the country, prosecution of offenders, the number of persons released and the number of convictions and why the Ministry was outsourcing the Maritime cases to lawyers outside the Ministry.\n\nAnother area of concern to the lawmaker was the current status of the anti-torture legislation.\n\nHe said: \u201cI saw the sum of N43 million appropriated for local training in your 2021 budget and N35 million has been released, while N32.1million has been expended. Despite these trainings for our lawyers, we still see that a lot of the jobs are outsourced.\n\n\u201cWe spent N2.5 billion for legal services. You spoke of some limitations about lawyers not been able to take up those jobs. What are these limitations?\n\n\u201cI want to ask about the anti-torture legislation. You will recall that most of the protests are as a result of abuse of office by some of our police officers.\n\n\u201cI want to find out if the legislation is now in place and if it has not been put in place, what is the Ministry doing about putting it in place. Also, sometime in 2017, you promised us an anti-torture policy. I want to find out how far you have gone with that policy.\u201d\n\nAt this juncture, the Committee chairman who had allowed the questions to fly intoned that the answers to the questions will be supplied in the future.\n\n\u201cThe questions are noted. We will have to give the Minister another date to respond to these questions\u201d, Ozurigbo said, hitting the gavel.\n\nThe chairman ignored a string of protests that ensured from among the members as he discharged the Minister who had earlier made his presentation.\n\nMembers were also not allowed to raise questions on the budget presentation.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Malami decried poor budgetary allocation to the Justice sector.\n\nThe AGF also disclosed that there were more funds stashed abroad.\n\nHe, however, said efforts were being made to recover and repatriate them.\n\nThe Minister also disclosed that the Federal Executive Council, FEC had asked his office to cause a memo for the establishment of a Federal Taskforce to review and validate contracts, Judgments and Arbitral Awards and implement the Federal Verification System.\n\nThis, according to him, was to prevent cases similar to the P&ID.\n\nMalami also said that approval had been given by the government to incorporate the funding requirements of a Federal Contracts Administration System (FCAS) in Nigeria in the Federal Ministry of Justice\u2019s 2022 Budget proposal just as he highlighted that cases of COVID-19 pandemic, kidnapping and armed banditry were some of the challenges faced by the ministry in the outgoing fiscal year.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nImaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim on Monday made startling revelations about the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) the country, placing their number at 3 million.\n\nIbrahim who is the Federal Commissioner for the National Refugees for National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons said that the number added by one million in the past one year.\n\nThe Commissioner also said over 500,000 Nigerians were awaiting repatriation from Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Libya and other countries.\n\nShe added that country was also host to about 73, 000 refugees from 23 countries.\n\nIbrahim spoke while defending the 2022 budget of the agency with the House of Representatives Committee on IDPs and Refugees chaired by Hon. Mohammed Jega.\n\n\u201cDue to the current unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Nigerian and the alarming growth rate of displacement, the number of IDPs have increased in the past one year by about 1milion causing the number of displaced persons in Nigeria to rise to a frightening 3 million.\n\n\u201cNigeria is also host to about 73, 000 refugees from 23 countries with over 500, 000 Nigerians awaiting repatriation from Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Libya and other countries.\n\n\u201cWe know that data is very scarce in this area of work we do but we are still working on ensuring that we have accurate data that we can properly reference but whatever we have we would present based on the figures that I have given\u201d, she said.\n\nSpeaking on the 2022 budget, the Commissioner said that the proposed aggregate expenditure for 2022 is N5, 740, 063, 922.\n\nThe details, she said, consisted of N1, 182, 728, 095 for recurrent cost and N4, 457, 335, 827 for the capital component.\n\nShe called for increase in the budgetary allocation of the agency to enable it increase its presence across the 6 geo-political zones and deliver on its mandate effectively.\n\nA member of the committee, Hon. Darlington Nwokocha had in his remarks asked Ibrahim to make the data of the refugees and others available to enable the committee take positive measures.\n\n\u201cThis is budget defence and we expect that after this presentation, we now transmit to appropriation and then to the main House of the Whole.\n\nYou said that in Nigeria is also host host to about 73, 000 refugees from 23 countries with over 500, 000 Nigerians awaiting repatriation from Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, Cameroon, Libya and other countries. I think it is important that you have presented the indices of this particular information because we need to verify.\n\n\u201cWe are not verifying that you are not doing then right thing or the wrong thing. We would like to have the numbers of these people, the location and things alike that because that would give us the strength and ability to track their information to ensure it is properly included cost wise in this budget\u201d, he said.\n\nSimilarly, another member of the Commitee, Hon. Awaji Abiante (PDP, Rivers) also raised a question about recurring issue of resetting the people of Bakassi to which N200 million was appropriated in 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long we would be resettling Bakassi IDPs. I don\u2019t know for how long. That has been around for over 10 years. We keep resettling them. We resettle until we resettle the fourth generation.

          "text": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has asked the Kaduna State Police Command to release the National publicity secretary of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union Mr. Luka Biniyat, immediately.\n\nHURIWA said the reported detention for over five days of Biniyat on the alleged order of the State Commissioner for internal security on the accusation of defamation, amounted to an abuse of power.\n\nRecall that the Kaduna State commissioner for internal security Mr. Samuel Aruwan had on Sunday alluded to his role in the detention of Biniyat in a briefing he gave to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nReacting to the development, HURIWA, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, faulted the resort to self-help by Aruwan for purportedly deploying the services of the Kaduna State Police Command to clamp into detention someone he accused of defaming his person instead of following the due process of law.\n\nHURIWA also argued that the principle of the rule of law makes it incumbent that he who alleges must prove his allegations in the competent court of law and not through what seemed like the manipulation of state security apparatus to pursue personal matters.\n\nThe organization quoted the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, to have affirmed that \u201cDefamation\u201d means \u201cHolding up a person to ridicule, scorn or contempt in a respectable and considerable part of the community; maybe criminal as well as civil\u201d.\n\nHURIWA asserted that defamation is the unprivileged publication of false statements which naturally and approximately result in injury to another. A communication is defamatory if it tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him. The meaning of a communication is that which the recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably understands that it was intended to express. It is important to note that Libel and Slander are both methods of Defamation, the former being expressed by print, written pictures or signs: the latter by oral expressions or transitory gestures Defamatory Statements may consist of libel (written publication) and slander.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to a plethora of decided cases, it has been held that in order to succeed in an action for Defamation, a plaintiff must prove that the libel or slander has been published, that is communicated to some other person or persons other than the plaintiff himself. See UGO V. OKAFOR (1996) 3 NWLR (PT. 438) 542 AT 560\u201d, HURIWA asserted.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Nigerian constitution clearly states that persons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court within a \u201creasonable time\u201d. According to the constitution, the reasonable time means a period of 24 hours when a court of competent jurisdiction is within a radius of 40 kilometres to the police station or a period of two days in any other case.\u201d\n\nHURIWA, therefore, is demanding the immediate release from illegal police detention of Mr. Luka Biniyat since the plaintiff himself decided to take the law into his hand rather than follow the due process of the law by personally instituting either a civil or criminal case against the Defendant and accord him all the rights and privileges of fair hearing as provided for by the Grund Norm of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

Do they have the appropriation for what they have spent? Because all these things are happening every year. Once they retained revenue, the just go and spend it without referring to the committee of appropriation.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is variation of the approval of the national assembly. If you don\u2019t do that, for me, it is misappropriation, he said.\n\nThe Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Hajiya Aisha Abubakar had earlier told the Senator Saidu Alkali led- Committee that the Ministry projected to generate the sum of N1.6 billion in 2021, part of which N1.19 billion was already realised between the month of January and September 2021.\n\nShe referred the Committee to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry to explain how the twenty percent retention was utililsed.\n\nIn a swift reaction, the Permanent Secretary urged Senators to excuse him as he only resumed resumed three months ago which he doesn\u2019t have adequate information to furnish Senators.\n\nMeanwhile, both Director Finance and Administration and Director, Weights and Measures could not explain how and what exactly the money was used for, as they were both interrupted by the Chairman of the Committee, requested that they give details of how the N177 million was expended.\n\nSenator Alkali queried: \u201cthis is performance. You are supposed to bring the details with underlying items.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is, how did you spend the 20% you retained as percentage from the revenue you realised? Where are the details? This is what we are asking. How did you expend the amount you retained under your department? You have indicated here, this you have realised, this is what you have remitted to CRA and this is what you have retained. So we are asking, how did you spend the amount you retained?.\n\n\u201cYou are not supposed to tell us this is how it is spent. It is supposed to be clearly written under a subject. The Ministry is supposed to have it under a subject, which the details are not here.\n\n\u201cWho give you the authority to spend N177 million and how did you spend it because you are supposed to get the approval of the National Assembly\u201d, he further queried.",

PDP and YPP won Ogbaru and Nnewi North respectively while election did not hold in Orumba North and Ihiala LGAs according to their collation officers.\n\nMeanwhile, a little drama played out during the declaration of the collated results of the election at the INEC headquarters in Awka, as the collation officer for Orumba North, Dr. Michael Otu alleged that he signed result of election under duress. He accused the Electoral Officer, Comfort Omoringe, who he worked with of playing double standards. He said he chose to announce the cancellation of the entire result because the entire process was not transparent.\n\nBut Omoringe dismissed the allegations as untrue. She, however, said collation officer had no idea of what his job entailed.\n\n\u201cHe does not know the difference between conducting election and collating election. How could I have carried 253 units to my office to be conducting election? It never happened.\u201d\n\nShe added that she escaped death by the whiskers as the police shot at her twice. She explained that the bullets did not hit her as they passed by her sides, miraculously.\n\nThe state collation officer, Prof. Florence Obi, vice chancellor of the University of Calabar, however, ordered that the Orumba North result should be reviewed by all concerned so that the result could be announced.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC has rejected the outcome of the election, demanding for its cancellation.\n\nChairman of the party in the state, Chief Basil Ejidike, in a statement, said: \u201cWhat is happening in Anambra is never an election but big time electoral fraud and malpractice. We want the whole world to hear our voice that we will never accept the outcome of the Anambra gubernatorial election.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile three civil society organisations (CSOs) have urged Nigerians to continue to support the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in its use of technology for elections.\n\nThe CSOs that monitored the election in Anambra gave the advice against the backdrop of the challenges witnessed in state\u2019s governorship election on Saturday.\n\nThey stated this in a joint statement issued in Abuja, yesterday, and signed by the Executive Director, Adopt A Goal, Dare Atoye; Chief Executive Officer of YSAD, Obinna Nwagbara; and the Executive Director, EaglePost, Dodoh Okafor.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the glitches recorded in the use of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by INEC in the just concluded Anambra governorship poll, there was no alternative to the use of technology in elections,\u201d they said.\n\nThe organisations expressed optimism that the teething challenges could be overcome in future as Nigeria prepares for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cAs partners on electoral governance, we note with great displeasure that despite weeks of preparations and commitments in terms of human and financial resources, the BVAS did not yield the optimal outcome leading to the extension of voting in several places and the disenfranchisement of others.\n\n\u201cWhile we insist that INEC ought to have sorted out these knotty issues before Saturday\u2019s election, our team would like to keep hope alive by believing that these teething challenges can be overcome as we prepare for the general election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe would like to encourage Nigerians to support INEC to overcome these challenges as we work to move away from the old, fraudulent system of voting and recruiting leaders.\n\n\u201cWhile we concede to the people the right to be exasperated by what happened in several polling units today, we would caution against throwing away the baby with the bath water.\n\n\u201cElectronic accreditation and transmission of results are the way to go if we are to restore hope in our elections.\n\n\u201cWe must never move away from these critical objectives because of the challenges witnessed in the Anambra Decides 2021,\u201d the CSOs said.\n\nThe CSOs said they expect INEC, after Anambra election, to sit down with its IT and operational teams and other stakeholders to study the whole events of the election and find out what needs to be fixed to get things right ahead of the general election in 2023.\n\nThey also advised INEC to institutionalise the training and retraining of poll workers/volunteers and have them pooled in its reserves nationwide.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Soludo in Apparent Victory in Anambra Poll, Election to Hold in Ihiala Tomorrow",
          "text": "Nseobong Okon-Ekong, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has declared Anambra election inconclusive, following the failure of the exercise to hold in Ihiala Local Government Area.\n\nThis followed the inability of the commission to deploy staff and materials to Ihiala, as a result of security threat.\n\nReturning officer in the election, Prof. Florence Obi, has however said the Ihiala election would now hold tomorrow, Tuesday, November 9, to complement the 20 local government areas election results, already announced.\n\nObi said, \u201cWe have collated results for 20 local government areas, and Ihiala is still outstanding as the commission was unable to deploy to the area.\n\n\u201cBased on constitutional provision, supplementary election will be held in Ihiala. So, we have to conclude the election in Ihiala to be able to conclude the process.\n\n\u201cI plead with you to support INEC, so we can bring this election to a conclusion, to the glory of God. The election for Ihiala will hold on November 9.\u201d\n\nBut the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, has apparently already surpassed the constitutional threshold for him to be declared winner of Anambra election after winning 18 out of the 21 local government areas in the state.\n\nEven though his victory dance has been delayed by technicality, which forced INEC to declare the vote inconclusive, Soludo appears destined for Government House, Akwa with a comfortable lead well ahead of his closest rival, in distant second place.\n\nAlthough Soludo\u2019s lead is statistically unassailable, yet it is mathematically possible to catch him but extremely unlikely in the circumstance, looking at the turnout of voters statewide, put at 20 percent.\n\nNonetheless, a civil society coalition, the Situation Room, which monitored the election, said except for the malfunctioning of the Bi-Modal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) and late commencement of voting in many areas, the governorship election was peaceful and without much rancour.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Chairman of APGA, Chief Victor Oye, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the outcome of the election, saying his fatherly disposition provided the ground for a free, fair and credible exercise.\n\nWith 18 council areas in the bag for APGA, only Nnewi North Local Government Area for Ifeanyi Ubah\u2019s Young Progressive Party (YPP), and Ogbaru Local Government Area for Valentine Ozigbo\u2019s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Soludo led his closest challenger, Ozigbo, with about 45,000 votes.\n\nBut, Ihiala alone, where voting was suspended, had over 148,000 registered voters.\n\nEarlier last night, collation officers for Ihiala and Orumba North had alleged at the INEC collation centre that elections did not hold in some places due to violence, while the other said he was forced to sign a result sheet.\n\nSpecifically, the collation officer for Ihiala said the election was marred by violence, while his counterpart in Orumba North, Dr. Michael Out, produced a signed result sheet collated by him, but claimed he signed it under duress. He said some political thugs, with the connivance of an electoral officer that was supposed to work with him, had forced him to sign the result sheet.\n\n\u201cI signed the result, but I do not believe in it because I did it under duress. I was tear-gassed, and my life was threatened,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the electoral officer denied the claim, forcing INEC to take a break to review the situation in the two local governments.\n\nWhile decision on Orumba was quick and conceded to Soludo, it was not the same with Ihiala.\n\nWhen INEC officials returned from their break, Chairman of Academic Staff Union of University, University of Calabar, Dr. Othong, who was appointed to look into the Orumba case, said, \u201cAfter looking at the matter, we saw no evidence of use of BVAS, we also discovered police crisis in the local government at the local government collation centre, and also, heavy mutilation of the result sheet.\n\n\u201cCommittee resolved to call for the BVAS machine used in the area, but that was not achievable as the BVAS were said not to be readily available.\u201d\n\nThe committee, after a long time, however, resolved the matter and read out the result as follows: PDP, 1847; APC, 2672 and APGA, 4787, making it the 18th local government won by APGA.\n\nBut with Ihiala still pending, many believed it was unlikely that INEC would disenfranchise more than 148,000 voters in the critical local government area and go ahead to declare a winner in the election.\n\nThat was why the commission declared the election inconclusive to enable it hold supplementary election in Ihiala, and also other polling units, where elections did not hold or were marred by incidences.\n\nHowever, with the results so far released, Soludo has secured the mandatory two-thirds majority votes and spread across the local governments in the state and might be coasting home to victory.\n\nThe former CBN governor, who experienced glitches from the new INEC Bi-modal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) device before he could cast his vote at his Isuofia homestead in Aguata Local Government Area, triumphed over Uba and Ozigbo, who were also from Aguata.\n\nWhile Soludo polled 9,136 votes in the local government area, Uba came second with 4,773 votes, while Ozigbo had3,798 votes.\n\nAPGA\u2019s imminent victory is coming against strong odds, including the recent defection of the deputy governor, Dr. Nkem Okeke, six members of the Anambra State House of Assembly, and some members of the National Assembly, including numerous other stakeholders of the party.\n\nResults so far announced also showed that the three leading candidates, as profiled by popular opinion polls, turned out truly in the lead, running neck and neck in some of the local government areas.\n\nThough APGA, PDP and APC remained predominant winners in most areas, a few other political parties were able to put up a good fight, like the YPP, which overwhelmingly won Nnewi North Local government Area. There were others like the Zenith Labour Party, which performed well in some parts of the state, as well as the Accord Party.\n\nThe candidate of Accord Party, Dr. Godwin Maduka, however lost his local government area, Orumba South, to APGA. The Las Vegas, US-based medical doctor and foremost pain doctor, scored a mere 779 votes in his local government, which had 74,690 registered voters and 10,554 accredited voters.\n\nHe was also defeated by the other leading political parties in the race. Despite being very popular in his local government, APGA scored 4,394 to win the local government, and was followed by APC with 2,060, and PDP with 1,672 votes.\n\nIn Anaocha Local Government Area, APGA defeated PDP, the party of former governor, Mr Peter Obi, and Senator Uche Ekwunife, who is the senator for Anambra Central. Both are from Anaocha Local Government Area.\n\nA former National Chairman of APGA, Senator Victor Umeh, also hails from the local government area.\n\nMeanwhile, the Civil Society Situation Room, has hailed the general conduct of the election, describing it as peaceful.\n\nConvener of the group, Mrs. Ene Obi, who briefed journalists, said, \u201cThe election was generally peaceful. This was against the background of potential violence rhetoric leading up to the election, even though there were pockets of disturbances.\n\n\u201cOn a general note, citizens came out to vote, contrary to the initial apprehension that trailed the beginning of the electioneering process. Even though there were not large crowds of voters, it was still a relief to see citizens come out eventually to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe call on the resilient people of Anambra to remain calm and law abiding as the election runs its course. We call on INEC to ensure the peaceful and transparent conclusion of this election. Situation Room also calls on security agencies to continue to maintain law and order through the remaining phases of this exercise.\u201d\n\nAs part of its observations, the Situation Room said officials of INEC and ad hoc staff arrived late with election materials in 67 per cent of the polling units (PU) and polls commenced between 10am and 12:30pm in 53.5 per cent of the voting locations observed.\n\nSituation Room said there were delays in the commencement of polls in locations, such as PU 001 and 008 in Amansea ward of Awka North Local Government Area, PU 017 and 018 in Uga I ward of Aguata Local Government Area, and several others.\n\nIt also noted that in some places, particularly, voting locations in parts of Ihiala, Idemili North and Idemili South local government areas, no INEC staff or material was deployed.\n\nOn the deployment of BVAS, Situation Room said reports from field observers indicated widespread malfunction of the technology, as it failed to authenticate voters\u2019 fingerprints and detect faces.\n\nAccording to the Situation Room, \u201cThis was the case in 59 per cent of the PUs observed, with a minimum of five minutes to accredit one voter in 65.8 per cent of the PUs observed. Furthermore, some of the ad-hoc staff experienced some difficulty in operating the machines. In some locations, the machines were working rather slowly and took as long as 10 minutes or more to accredit a single voter. This severely stalled the accreditation and voting process.\n\n\u201cThese challenges were observed in the following locations: PU 007 in Awka-Etiti II ward in Idemili South LGA, PU 013 in Nawfia II ward of Njikoka LGA, PU 017 in Uruagu I ward of Nnewi North LGA, amongst others.\u201d\n\nSituation Room also said security officials were present at most of the polling units visited and they were relatively civil in their conduct within and outside polling units.\n\nIt said it received reports of widespread vote buying by political party agents across the state.\n\nOn his part, the national chairman of APGA, Oye, who spoke to newsmen in Awka, yesterday, said Buhari had proven to be a father by giving INEC a free hand to conduct the election.\n\nOye said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has always been a father by allowing INEC to conduct free, fair and credible elections in the country. He will also insist on allowing the people\u2019s will to prevail and not the other way round. Left to some other people, the election will have been rigged in favour of another party. But he has always told them to allow the choice of the people to prevail, that is why APGA is winning the election.\u201d\n\nOye also commended residents of the state for the peaceful conduct of the election, saying, \u201cAnambra people are known to be peaceful. The violence we had some time ago was imported. Our people are not in any way associated with violence.\u201d\n\nOn the calls for a supplementary election in some areas affected by malfunctioning of INEC voting equipment or where violence marred the exercise, Oye said such an election would only enhance the victory of APGA.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Soludo\u2019s Imminent Victory: How Anambra Voted",
          "text": "David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nAll things being equal, the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, is set for victory, having so far won 17 out of the 21 local government areas of the state.\n\nMany variables helped to sway the people\u2019s vote.\n\nIn 2017, outgoing Governor Willie Obiano, a member of APGA, won all the 21 local government areas in the state in what is today popularly referred to as \u201c21 over 21\u201d by the party. During the campaigns for last Saturday\u2019s election, Obiano had during a rally in Awka said, APGA was not only going to replicate the feat by winning all the local government areas, as it did in 2017, but would also go a notch higher to ensure victory in every ward in the state.\n\nBut, yesterday, from the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APGA failed to clear all 21 local government areas. Yet, it put up an impressive showing by winning 18 out of the 20 local government areas, whose results were announced.\n\nFrom the results, the Young Progressives Party (YPP) won Nnewi North, where its candidate, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, hails from, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won in Ogbaru Local Government Area.\n\nBut INEC failed to declare result in two local government areas of Ihiala, where the collation officer claimed elections were marred by violence, and in Orumba North, where the collation officer, Dr. Micheal Out, insisted he signed the result sheet under duress.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that APGA has an overwhelming lead in the election with 18 local government areas, including Dunukofia, Awka South, Oyi, Ayamelum, Anambra East, Anaocha, Idemili South, and Onitsha South. Others are Njikoka, Orumba South, Onitsha North, Aguata, Idemili North, NNewi South, Awka North, and Anambra West. APGA also prevailed in the controversial Orumba North LGA poll which was declared in its favour late yesterday night. The result announced showed that PDP \u2013 184, APC \u2013 2672, APGA \u2013 4787 bringing APGA to winning18 local governments, out of the 21 council areas in the state.\n\nExcept for Nnewi North, where Ubah won overwhelmingly, and Ogbaru, where the PDP won, all other local government areas were taken by APGA.\n\nMany have attributed this level of success to both the popularity of APGA, which has come to be known as the predominant party in the state, the personality of Soludo, and the belief of the people in his ability to transform his dreams and ideas into reality, like he did at the Central Bank of Nigeria, when he was CBN Governor.\n\nLooking carefully at the result, Soludo garnered votes from every senatorial zone of the state, including winning some local government areas that were reputed to be the strongholds of the contestants. Though he hails from the same local government area as two other top contestants \u2013 PDP\u2019s Valentine Ozigbo and APC\u2019s Andy Uba \u2013 Soludo was able to win the local government area with a wide margin, after securing 9,136 votes, with the closest to him, Uba, standing far behind at 4,773.\n\nIn Anaocha, where the leader of the PDP, and former governor of the state, Mr. Peter Obi, and Senator Uche Ekwunife hail from, APGA and Soludo braced the odds to poll the highest votes.\n\nSoludo also won in Orumba South, where Dr Godwin Maduka of Accord hails from, and also in Idemili, where the chairman of United Nigeria Airline, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, comes from, and in Njikoka, where the Deputy Governor of Anambra, Dr Nkem Okeke, who recently defected to APC, comes from.\n\nThe state chairman of APGA, Chief Norbert Obi, once stated that APGA would rule Anambra for 50 years, but beyond such assertion, a public affairs analyst, Mr Okechukwu Eze, said the combination of APGA as a grassroots party, and the integrity and acceptability of Soludo were the reasons for the victory last Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf not so, why did Soludo not win in 2010, when he contested on the platform of PDP, when he was even still very fresh from the CBN?\u201d Eze asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "In 2017, outgoing Governor Willie Obiano, a member of APGA, won all the 21 local government areas in the state in what is today popularly referred to as \u201c21 over 21\u201d by the party.\nBut, yesterday, from the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APGA failed to clear all 21 local government areas.\nYet, it put up an impressive showing by winning 18 out of the 20 local government areas, whose results were announced.\nOthers are Njikoka, Orumba South, Onitsha North, Aguata, Idemili North, NNewi South, Awka North, and Anambra West.\nExcept for Nnewi North, where Ubah won overwhelmingly, and Ogbaru, where the PDP won, all other local government areas were taken by APGA.",

          "text": "*Cuts naira printing costs to N58bn\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that it recorded a significant reduction in the volume and cost of foreign exchange procurement in 2020, the year of COVID, when the entire world was on lockdown and businesses closed.\n\nThe bank said a total of $1.83 billion was procured over the period, representing a decline of $2.12 billion or 53.67 per cent compared to the $3.95 billion procured in 2019.\n\nAccording to the annual report by the apex bank\u2019s Currency Operations Department (COD) which was posted on its website, the CBN also slashed its expenditure on currency printing from N75.52 billion in 2019 to N58.61 billion in 2020.\n\nThe central bank explained that this was used to fund Bureaux De Change (BDC) operations, payment of estacode and Personal Travel Allowances (PTA) to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nThe CBN stated that receipt and authentication of foreign currency deposits by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) reduced significantly due to the downturn in global trade in 2020.\n\nThis represented a decrease of N16.91 billion or 28.84 per cent compared to the preceding year.\n\nAccording to the central bank, currency printing gulped N64.04 billion in 2018.\n\nSources said the reduction was in line with the policy objective of the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to reduce the cost of printing bank notes and cash management, in the country.\n\nThe Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also known as the eNaira, which was unveiled recently by President Muhammadu Buhari, is in line with the policy to further reduce the cost of printing the naira.\n\nAccording to the report, total stock of currency (issuable and non-issuable) in the vaults of the CBN stood at 2.75 billion as at December 2020 compared to 2.64 billion pieces in 2019, indicating an increase of 105.73 million pieces or 4 per cent.\n\nIn the period under review, total issuable notes (newly printed notes and Counted Audited Clean notes) was 592.94 million pieces, compared with 726.43 million pieces in 2019, representing a decrease of 133.49 million pieces or 18.38 per cent.\n\nThe central bank said it generated the sum of N6.50 billion as total income from currency management activities in 2020, compared with N13.24 billion in the preceding year, representing a decrease of N6.74 billion or 50.92 per cent.\n\nThe bank explained that the income generated was largely, from penal charges on unsorted banknotes deposited by Deposit Money Bank (DMBs) and charges for authentication of foreign currency deposits with the central bank.\n\nThe CBN, however, incurred a total of N67.21 billion as expenses on currency operations in 2020, representing a decrease of N17.96 billion or 21.08 per cent, less than N 85.18 billion in 2019.\n\nThe apex bank added that despite the limitations occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact in 2020, the bank nonetheless, concluded upgrade of the Cash Activity Reporting Portal (CARP) for transmission of currency management data from the financial industry to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS).\n\nIt also completed the development of the Mint tracking system application, needs assessment on the infrastructure, user sensitisation, test run at five branches and end-to-end system tests with a view to instituting the pilot launch in 2021.\n\nThe CBN also commenced establishment of the currency lab for banknote quality assessment, authentication and independent investigations as well as to adjudicate cases of suspected counterfeit banknotes.\n\nIt also registered an additional Cash-in-Transit (CIT) company which brought the total to nine CIT companies, to further deepen the private sector participation in CIT services among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The company claimed it entered a contract to build a gas processing plant in Calabar, Cross River state and that the deal collapsed because the Nigerian government did not fulfil its end of the bargain.\n\nDefending the need for the task force, Malami told the senate committee that the P&ID contract did not go through the AGFs office or the federal executive council (FEC) for vetting.\n\n\u201cThe major problem with P&ID is that the contract was never ever allowed to pass through the office of the attorney-general for vetting. So, on the account of that there are embedded in the contract clause that is inimical to the interest of the nation,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause of the fact that there is a preliminary conspiracy among the key promoters of the contract, the contract was never allowed to pass through the federal executive council, FEC for its approval, neither was it allowed to pass through the federal ministry of justice for vetting.\n\n\u201cThe existing structures are there, but they can only act in respect of contracts that are referred to the department. We have developed need for other circulars that these are intended clauses that could be tolerated in public interest and the interest of the nation in mind were attached.\n\n\u201cIn respect of P&ID, there were about nine contracts that were signed at the same time in breach of due processes and procedure. They are there; they simply use the P&ID as a test case.\n\n\u201cIf it has indeed, succeeded in taking away $10 billion out of our economy, those other existing contracts that were signed at the same time in breach could have now have been the contracts we will be faced with in terms of arbitration and associated issues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalami said the proposed task force would review the existing problematic contracts that can undermine the economy as far as the P&ID is concerned.",

The development came after election results for 20 out of 21 local government areas (LGAs) had been collated and announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlorence Obi, the returning officer for the election, said the decision to suspend the collation of results is to give room for a supplementary election in Ihiala LGA.\n\nAhmadu Umar, the collation officer for Ihiala LGA, had earlier said there was no election in the entire area.\n\nAs of Sunday, Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) secured 103,946 votes, followed by Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 51,322 votes, while Andy Uba, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had 42,942.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe margin between Soludo and Ozigbo currently stands at 52,624, and according to the collation officer for Ihiala, there are 148,407 registered voters in the LGA.\n\nObi explained that the final collation of results cannot be done until the polling units in Ihiala LGA are covered.\n\nThe supplementary election in Ihiala has now been fixed for November 9, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable explained all you need to know about an inconclusive poll here.\n\nAs it stands, the fate of the candidate that will steer the mantle of leadership in Anambra for the next four years lies in the hands of the people of Ihiala.\n\nThough Soludo is in the lead with over 50,000 votes, Ozigbo or Uba can still overtake him if either is able to secure about 60,000 votes in Ihiala come Tuesday \u2014 if other scenarios like a runoff election do not play out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut is that going to happen? Can Ihiala swing the tide? Here is what we have learned from the past and what may likely play out in the future.\n\nIHIALA 2010\n\nIn the Anambra 2010 governorship election, the total number of registered voters in Ihiala was 83,348. Of this figure, the total number of valid votes cast stood at 16,029. In the final results, APGA polled 5,996; AC had 1,803; while PDP secured 4,945. APGA won the LGA, ushering in Peter Obi (APGA) as governor for his second term.\n\nIHIALA 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, the total number of registered voters in Ihiala was 111,531 while the total votes cast was 24,203. Again, APGA won the LGA after polling 10,274 votes. PDP came second with 5,520 votes while APC came third with 4,087 votes. The election brought in Willie Obiano (APGA) as governor.\n\nIHIALA 2017\n\nIn the 2017 governorship election in Anambra, a total of 124, 588 voters were registered in Ihiala. In the final results, APGA won the LGA again, after polling 14,379 votes. APC came second with 7,894 votes while PDP followed next with 4,706 votes.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE IHIALA FACTOR?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not expected that geographical affiliation will favour any of the top three candidates as neither is from Ihiala.\n\nAlso, that Ihiala has one of the highest (148,407) registered voters in the state for the 2021 election does not necessarily mean it will churn out a high voters count. From what we have seen in past elections, voter apathy has always been high in Anambra generally and Ihiala specifically.\n\nFrom the past three elections under view, the voter turnout has always been less than 50 percent of the registered voters.\n\nSO, CAN IHIALA SWING THE TIDE?\n\nA simple answer would be no. APGA has won all past three elections and if Ihiala voters are to follow this trend, they will give Soludo more votes, further increasing his winner margin and consolidating his victory.\n\nAlso, it is highly unlikely that all or even half of the registered voters in Ihiala come out to vote. Even if they do, all 18 candidates contesting the election will share the votes among themselves, making it further harder for either Ozigbo or Uba to poll enough votes to outshine Soludo.\n\nBut politics is not simple, and it is quite unpredictable. At the last minute, an alliance can be birthed by two or more parties with the aim of dousing the chances of a stronger contender. So, anything is possible in the final outcome.",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate [November 8, 2021, at 3:33 p.m. WAT]: The launch of Nestcoin\u2019s media platform, Breach, scheduled for November 8, 2021 has been postponed to November 9, 2021.\n\nThe uninitiated usually think of Bitcoin whenever the word blockchain is mentioned.\n\nAnd they can be excused. After all, Bitcoin popularised blockchain technology. But there\u2019s more to it; blockchain has evolved, creating opportunities that are accessible to anyone in the world.\n\nBut it\u2019s complicated, and only the few who can find their way around the blockchain space are harnessing these opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYele Bademosi, Founder and former CEO of crypto and cash payments company, Bundle Africa, wants to change this with his new company, Nestcoin.\n\nToday, the company is also launching its first product, a crypto media platform \u2014 Breach.\n\nNestcoin wants to expose Africans to the benefits and possibilities of Blockchain.\n\nHowever, the idea for Nestcoin was in the works for a while and can be traced to a time when Bademosi knew next to nothing about crypto.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he revealed that his first contact with cryptocurrencies was in 2014. He met someone who had gotten Bitcoin as a gift, and he wanted to know what it was.\n\nHe did some research but still didn\u2019t give it much thought until 2017, when his Twitter feed was agog with this money-making phenomenon \u2014 Bitcoin.\n\nAdmittedly, his interest in Bitcoin was sparked by the possibility of making a lot of money, but that changed when he started reading tweets by AngelList Founder, Naval Ravikant, who explained the core of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\n\n\u201cHe described it as coordination, this idea that you could, without the need for a centralised authority, organise and coordinate millions of individuals and organisations at scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe realised crypto and blockchain are beyond trading and hodling. Bademosi sees it as a technology that could positively transform several sectors of the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been driven personally to try to understand or figure out how we could kind of create alternative systems for economic coordination in Africa.\u201d\n\nBademosi (Netcoin CEO) and Taiwo Orilogbon (Netcoin CTO) are on a mission to make crypto accessible to Africans and transition Africa to a sustainable economy through crypto.\n\nWhat is Nestcoin?\n\nAccording to Bademosi, Nestcoin is an umbrella company with several blockchain and crypto products. He added that it could also make investments in companies with a similar cause.\n\nEssentially, the goal of every Nestcoin product is to create simple platforms where Africans can interact with all things crypto as a way of creating economic value for themselves.\n\nWhat\u2019s the business model?\n\nNestcoin will have varying products with different business models, but most will have native tokens, which will serve as a means of revenue generation.\n\nBademosi explained that in the decentralised world, there isn\u2019t really a need to charge a fee for services like traditional organisations.\n\nHe said incentives can be designed \u201cthrough the tokens that allows one to still benefit from the value created.\n\n\u201cNow, it doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t have products that take a percentage or a fee, but generally, that\u2019s how we would like to design a lot of the products that we create.\n\n\u201cIt gives as much value to users in the ecosystem and keeps our fees or any spreads as low as possible.\u201d\n\nThe same model can be found in decentralised platforms such as Uniswap, an exchange on the Ethereum blockchain helping users swap tokens using the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nAlthough Uniswap takes fees from every transaction, it also generates revenue by issuing its own tokens.\n\nIs crypto secure enough?\n\nWhile the idea of decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO) or decentralised finance (DeFi) could provide Africans unfettered access to financial opportunities, there\u2019s still the question of safety.\n\nThe first DAO suffered a $150 million hack in 2016 due to loopholes in its infrastructure. Recently, Cream Finance, a DeFi platform, lost to a hack $130 million.\n\nTo assure safety, Bademosi said Nestcoin would only expose users to platforms that conduct regular security audits.\n\nHowever, the threat to crypto products or platforms doesn\u2019t end with security concerns; regulations also play an important role in their survival. In Nigeria, for example, the Central Bank restricted banks from facilitating crypto-based transactions.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, describes crypto as \u201cmoney out of thin air,\u201d expressing his distrust in the technology.\n\n\u201cFor us, we take regulation and compliance quite seriously,\u201d Bademosi said. He pointed out that there are crypto companies, such as Coinbase and FTX, that have shown that the crypto business can be regulatory-compliant.\n\nNevertheless, he holds the notion that governments should be pro-innovation.\n\n\u201cOur belief is that over time, people realise that crypto is a positive innovation for the world.\u201d\n\nNestcoin leads the way with Breach\n\nNestcoin is starting its mission with Breach, a globally-focused media platform that\u2019ll simplify crypto and blockchain concepts.\n\nAccording to Breach Product Manager, Chinny Eze, \u201cIt\u2019s a platform that breaks crypto concepts down into digestible bite-sized pieces for anyone to understand.\u201d\n\nShe says Breach will set itself apart from other crypto media platforms, with a new level of simplicity geared towards millennials and Gen Zs.\n\nA Breach Community platform is also in the works. More than creating content for consumption, the Breach Community will be a space for creators to have direct contact with audiences, fostering a better understanding of the concepts.\n\nLeading the Breach team as Managing Editor is David Adeleke, who doubles as Nestcoin\u2019s Communications Lead.\n\nAdeleke has held roles at media companies such as TechCabal, Techpoint Africa, and Ventures Africa.\n\nInterestingly, Breach will also have its native token \u2014 Breach token. Eze says the token is currently in the product roadmap, and the community will play an important role in its use.\n\nMore Nestcoin products?\n\nWhile Breach leads the way as the first in several products, Nestcoin will roll out more products with time.\n\nSome exciting products include a gaming platform where gamers earn in cryptocurrency and an NFT platform.\n\nFinancial products could also be in the works, as Bademosi said that when it comes to crypto, he truly cares about economic opportunities.\n\nHe believes that a person\u2019s geographical location should not determine access or the quality of financial services they get, a problem he\u2019s sure crypto will solve.\n\n\u201cI really believe that making crypto accessible for everybody in Africa and frontier markets is a worthy goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "What MTN, Airtel PSB licence approval could mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, November 8, 2021, telecom giants MTN and Airtel, in separate statements, revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had granted them approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs).\n\nSubject to meeting specific requirements over the next six months, the telecom operators would receive approval to operate PSBs. As expected, the announcements were greeted with support by Nigerians and hailed as an essential step in deepening financial inclusion in the country.\n\nSo what does this mean for financial inclusion in Nigeria? This article provides some answers but first, what are PSBs?\n\nAccording to Mondaq, payment service banks accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, MTN and Airtel would provide these services if they get the final approval. In doing so, they would be joining the likes of OPay and Paga in that space.\n\nSince 2012, an often-stated goal of the CBN has been to deepen financial inclusion in the country.\n\nThe World Bank defines financial inclusion as access to valuable and affordable financial products and services delivered responsibly and sustainably. These services include payments, savings, credit, insurance, and transactions.\n\nIt goes on to say that having a transaction account is the first step towards financial inclusion, as it provides individuals and businesses with a way to receive, send, and store money.\n\nConsequently, while the telcos would not offer a full suite of financial services, they would be able to provide users with an entry into the financial system.\n\nA significant reason for the optimism shown is the potential of telcos to fast-track the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goal. This is mainly due to their comprehensive coverage of the country, especially in rural areas that house most of the unbanked population.\n\nWith the infrastructural cost of setting up branches and security, banks are not opening branches in new locations and, in some cases, are shutting down operations. According to the International Monetary Fund, Nigerian banks closed 234 branches and 649 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in 2020, bringing the number of banks in Nigeria to 5,158 in 2020 from 5,392 in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, MTN and Airtel have the largest and third-largest subscribers at 67.5 million and 42 million, respectively. Even accounting for multiple SIM cards as is common in the country, those figures are significantly higher than the top three Nigerian banks by customer base. According to data from the GSM Association, there were 97.5 million unique mobile subscribers in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) puts the number of bank accounts in Nigeria at 160 million as of May 2021. At the same time, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) reports 190,854,069 active lines as of September 2021.\n\nHowever, the total BVN count as of October 31 was 50,728,469. Given that no one can have more than one BVN, it is safe to assume that the number of bank account holders in Nigeria is around the 50 million mark.\n\nWith the World Population Review putting the population of Nigerians over the age of 18 at 105,841,979, we could infer that there are about 55 million adult Nigerians without a bank account. This presents a huge opportunity for the new entrants and the millions of unbanked Nigerians.\n\nHaving successfully set up mobile money services in other parts of Africa, MTN and Airtel could replicate the success in Nigeria. This development bodes well for Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population as it would serve as a gateway into the financial services sector. While the PSBs cannot give loans, having a transaction account enables their users to access loans for their businesses and education.\n\nGranting PSB licences to the telcos is, however, just one step towards achieving financial inclusion. As we argued in a previous article, financial inclusion entails more than having a bank account.\n\nChallenges such as a lack of a unified identification system and increasing poverty rates remain. Opening an account is one thing but consistently funding that account is another. Admittedly, this is not a task for the telcos but is one they are bound to encounter.\n\nThere is no doubt that granting these telcos a PSB licence would boost the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion goals. However, for it to be truly impactful, it must go beyond adding numbers to the financial system to create tangible value for existing customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Afrobeats pays Nigerian artistes as the world listens",
          "text": "Nearly 45 years after Fela Kuti debuted Zombie, the album that gave the world a new music genre, Afrobeat, a new generation of proteges from Nigeria now has many music lovers around the world addicted. All thanks to a digital world where almost everything including music album launches takes place on a mobile phone.\n\nFor Kuti, building cult-like followership for Afrobeat meant tapping into the unspoken, visceral spirit of his audience through his lyrics and deeply interactive songs.\n\nHowever, for today\u2019s Nigerian artistes, it is mostly about plugging into a thriving streaming market backed by deep-pocket investors and a growing young population with an insatiable appetite for mobile gadgets and innovations that have simplified and even monetised music sharing.\n\nToday, Afrobeats sounds are not only breaking the ceiling on streaming services, gathering huge followers on social media platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, but it is also getting all the love from international music artistes like Robyn Rihanna Fenty known as Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter (Beyonce), Sean John Combs (P. Diddy), among others.\n\nThe year 2020 was particularly a defining moment for the Nigerian music industry in terms of announcing itself on the global stage. Hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, a lockdown, and economic meltdown, the industry sought an alternative. With concert venues shut for almost the entire year, the internet became the new stage, the venue, and the revenue collector.\n\nInterestingly, artistes heavily biased to Afrobeats thrived the most. David Adedeji Adeleke, known as Davido, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun (Wizkid), Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu (Burna Boy), and Olamide Adedeji (Olamide) led the industry\u2019s resurgence in the pandemic.\n\nBurna Boy, who shut into global consciousness in 2019 with his Outside and African Giant albums, a mixture of afrobeat, dancehall, pop, and hip pop, once again announced his genius with \u2018Twice as Tall\u2019 in 2020.\n\nThis time, Twice as Tall released in August 2020 broke many ceilings on various streaming platforms. In its first month, the album was streamed 175.3 million times across all platforms. It had 25 million streams on YouTube; 50.2 million on Audiomack; 34.5 million on Spotify; 18.4 million on Music Africa; 31 million on Music World, and Boomplay 10.5 million.\n\nIt was adjudged the most-streamed album of 2020 with 64 million streams by Spotify, double the 31 million streams garnered by second-placed Wizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos. As of November 4, 2021, all 15 songs on the Twice as Tall album have received about 1 billion views on YouTube.\n\nOn the global music boards, Twice as Tall topped various charts, peaking at No 1 in the World Albums category on Billboard charts.\n\nWizkid, however, took the record-breaking to a whole new level. Starting from 2016, when he was featured by Drake alongside Kyla on the hit song One Dance, Wizkid has seen a transformation unprecedented for any artiste in the Afrobeats genre. In 2019, he was recruited for Beyonc\u00e9 Brown Skin Girl from the Lion King: The Gift. The song also featured Blue Ivy Carter and SAINt JHN.\n\nThe two songs gave Wizkid his Grammy debut; a Grammy nomination (One Dance) and a Grammy win for best music video (Brown Skin Girl).\n\nWizkid\u2019s biggest strides however are on the charts and the streaming platforms his songs keep very busy. Essence, a song he released on October 30, 2020, has the entire music world hooked. The remix of the song featured Justin Bieber and Tems, another Nigerian music sensation. Essence entered the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart making him the first African artiste ever to have a song in the Top 10 Billboard. The Billboard Hot 100 is the music industry standard rating in the United States for songs published weekly by Billboard Magazine.\n\nEssence became the song of the summer \u2013 a position that was conferred on it by RollingStone \u2013 an indication of the coming of age of afrobeats on the global music scene.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 4, 2021, Wizkid became one of the highest nominees for the Soul Train Awards, 2021 by BET. He bagged five nominations in the categories of Song of the Year (Essence), Album of the Year (Made in Lagos), Video of the Year (Essence), Best Collaboration (Essence), and The Ashford and Simpson Songwriter\u2019s Award.\n\n\u201cThese are significant because they are in the mainstream categories. African artistes used to get nominated in the \u201cworld\u201d or \u201cinternational\u201d or \u201cAfrican\u201d categories. So, it\u2019s a first. Breaking Afrobeats into mainstream (and that\u2019s without making music to fit their African stereotypes of war, suffering, poverty and dictatorship). The point is while these things exist, it\u2019s important to show that we also live normal lives \u2013 love, club, build family, build career, build businesses, etc. And that\u2019s the point this wave is making,\u201d says Temitayo Lawal, an African music expert.\n\nIn the beginning, was Fela, then others\n\nThe old Afrika Shrine located at Empire Hotel, Mushin, Lagos, in 1977, that housed Fela\u2019s Egypt 80 band and most of his performances was notorious for many things including becoming a Mecca of sorts for young people seeking to get \u2018high\u2019 on Marijuana.\n\nIts biggest product, however, was the songs \u2013 the trance-like beating of the drums, the perfect blend of the assorted percussion instruments, the trumpeters, the raw energy of the women dancers, and Fela\u2019s voice resonating always minutes after the symphony had begun and soaked the adulating crowd. Every song was like observing a solemn oblation to a deity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Shrine because he asks for a minute of silence to pay homage to the ancestors and the gods,\u201d says Dele Sosimi who was a member of the famous Egypt 80 band. He was also a part of the Positive Force band with Femi Kuti, with whom he performed from 1986 to 1994. In both bands, Sosimi was a keyboard player.\n\nFela\u2019s brand of afrobeat was hinged on heavy instrumentation and lyrics of resistance. Most of the songs start as simmering instrumentals, methodically layering little rifts and long-line melodies into a strong groove; they make way for the messages he sings, then surges ahead with even more urgency.\n\n\u201cFela was Afrobeat,\u201d a senior executive of a global record label told BusinessDay. He pleaded anonymity because he wasn\u2019t in a position to speak for the company.\n\nFela\u2019s creative genius was such that scholars from the UK, the US, and other parts of the world would travel down to Nigeria for research on afrobeat, says Excel Joab, a music executive, entertainment podcaster, and A&R Consultant.\n\nAfter his death, his sons Femi and Seun continued to push the genre and even introduced new adaptations to it. However, it is the new generation of artistes that has taken a little of Fela\u2019s genius, Femi and Seun\u2019s reformed versions, and different global sounds to create a completely new version of afrobeats.\n\nRead also: African music industry getting global recognition \u2013 Samprincepowers\n\nSome music experts now try to make a distinction between Fela\u2019s Afrobeat and those being performed by artistes like DBanj, Olamide, Davido, among others. Some experts have described the new afrobeats as \u201cComputer-driven pop-R&B\u201d due to the visible influence of these genres in the new songs.\n\nNonetheless, the new afrobeats movement has grabbed the attention of not just music lovers but also global investors.\n\nNew money for afrobeats\n\nWhile Afrobeat has become the biggest movement in the Nigerian music industry, it is not immune to the vagaries of the industry, one of which is generating income. The industry is faced with enormous challenges trying to ensure talents receive their due compensation.\n\nBefore streaming service happened, earning income would mean that artistes needed to take their Compact Disks to marketers at Alaba or Onitsha or Pound Road, Aba, to help push in the market or plead with radio stations to give it air time.\n\nAn artiste could hit the big time once listeners start demanding a repeat of the song on radio. Consistent playtime is usually the magic that unlocks the door to being invited to perform at different concerts and on some occasions headline a big show. Hence, artistes made money from performing at events, endorsements by brands, and going on tours.\n\nThe advent of streaming services has however changed how music is consumed and distributed. Importantly, it has presented the artistes with a new global market they could not access before and a new way to earn money from their sweat.\n\nWhile streaming services have now eliminated the problems in the industry, it has enabled investors to realise the untapped market potential in the Nigerian music industry.\n\nThe music streaming market in Nigeria is today dominated by providers such as BoomPlay, which hits 75 million African users in July 2020. In October 2021, the platform\u2019s data were added to the data that inform the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard 200, Artiste 100, and Billboard Global 200 charts, as well as all other Billboard US and global charts that include streaming data.\n\nSpotify, Google\u2019s YouTube Music, Audiomack, and Apple Music are also pushing up their investments in the market. At present, there are about 13 music streaming services in Nigeria.\n\nRevenue in music streaming in Africa is expected to reach $271 million in 2021 and $493 million by 2025, according to data from Statista. Ironically, it is also expected that most of the revenue will be generated from consumers in the US.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a rich musical heritage, cultural diversity, and multiple languages so this translates to a huge range of preferences in music that necessitates agility for any music streaming service to make relevant recommendations and enable discoverability across music genres, personal moods, and moments,\u201d Phiona Okumu, head of music, sub-Saharan Africa, Spotify, told BusinessDay.\n\nApart from streaming investors, the industry is also drawing the attention of global record labels such as Universal Music Group, which came into Nigeria in 2018.\n\nAn expert says it is obvious UMG has seen the potential in the market and as market leaders, that\u2019s why they came early. In comparison to other record labels, the global record label is the only one that has fully functional offices in Nigeria, which is a testament to the potential of this market. It also has offices in Ghana, South Africa, and East Africa.\n\nNew money, old problems\n\nThe arrival of investors and streaming services has not fully addressed the consumption and distribution challenges the market faces. The biggest challenge facing streaming in Nigeria is internet connectivity. The quality of the internet is still low and often does not encourage video streaming.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa has the largest market in terms of streaming numbers, although Nigeria has the most population and commands the biggest number of artistes on the continent.\n\nMobile broadband penetration in Nigeria is at 40 percent compared with South Africa that has achieved over 90 percent. Smartphone penetration is also at 46 percent, which means millions of Nigerians are not able to join the music afrobeat party or experience the growing strength of afrobeats artistes around the world.\n\nOkumu of Spotify says the challenges of low data consumption, network instability, and the use of older mobile devices contribute to the prevalence of piracy.\n\n\u201cTo counter these challenges, we created Spotify Lite: a smaller version of our unparalleled music experience, offering users a reliable way to fully enjoy their favourite music in areas with limited bandwidth, or if they have limited phone storage, and even if they do not have the latest smartphones,\u201d Okumu states.\n\nAfrobeat is not waiting for Nigeria\n\nDespite the challenges the industry faces, stakeholders say the dominance of Afrobeats is just beginning and does not necessarily need to wait for Nigeria to achieve new heights.\n\nLove Nwantiti, an Afrobeat song by Ckay, described as the biggest-ever hit song out of Africa by Bloomberg after it became the first song from Africa to top YouTube\u2019s list of the most-watched music videos with 104.7 million streams. Ckay is also the first African artiste to appear on any of the top 25 lists for Bloomberg\u2019s Pop Star Power Rankings in October.\n\nOn September 11, 2021, Love Nwantiti became the No 1 song on Shazam\u2019s global charts. The chart tracks the most-searched songs in the world and ranks them on a chart.\n\nExcel Joab told BusinessDay in September that Ckay could grow bigger than he already is. However, he thinks Wizkid could get a second Grammy for his song Essence. RollingStone also projects Wizkid\u2019s Essence as one of the top contenders for a major category in the Grammy.\n\n\u201cWizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos has cracked the US via the power of Essence, and the album is getting nominations within their local award circuit. It is been nominated for Album of the Year at the Soul Train awards, further cementing its place in the African music hall of fame,\u201d says Joey Akan, CEO of Afrobeats Intelligence.\n\nWhile the artistes rise globally, experts say Nigeria would only benefit if internet connection is addressed. But Fela wherever he is would likely sleep peacefully knowing the light he lit many years ago is burning more brightly than ever.",

It is been nominated for Album of the Year at the Soul Train awards, further cementing its place in the African music hall of fame,\u201d says Joey Akan, CEO of Afrobeats Intelligence.\n\nWhile the artistes rise globally, experts say Nigeria would only benefit if internet connection is addressed.

          "text": "The global music streaming market has been a gold discovery for many Nigerian music artists as it presents limitless opportunities to reach a world they would have never thought possible. But challenges such as inadequate internet infrastructure, low income, and piracy remain hurdles in fully harnessing the potential of this new market.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers projects that Nigeria would be the world\u2019s fastest-growing entertainment and media market (E&M) with a 12.1 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over a five-year period (2017-2021).\n\nThe report also says that the total revenue that will be generated by all the players in Nigeria\u2019s E&M industry is expected to rise from $7.68 billion in 2021 to $9.03 billion in 2022, to $10.66 billion in 2023, and will increase further to $12.56 billion in 2024 before settling at $14.82 billion by 2025, culminating to an average growth rate of 18 percent during that period.\n\nThe streaming services such as Boomplay, Spotify, Audiomack, YouTube, etc are enabling an environment in which Nigerian creatives including music artists of all genres can not only reach a wide audience but also monetise their content. Before now the only way an artist could earn money was to be invited to perform in a music show or sell their songs to marketers at Alaba or Onitsha.\n\nAn expert in one of the streaming services who pleaded anonymity said streaming music started when a new group of artists that called themselves Alt\u00e9 Kids came on the scene. These artists started putting their songs on SoundCloud, a Swedish-founded audio distribution and music sharing platform. Their bold move made their songs popular and helped them reach more people compared to existing distribution channels. They later collaborated with blogs and magazines like Native Mag which had a diaspora audience. This proved to be a major turning point in music distribution and the streaming market which saw increased adoption.\n\nExperts have also noted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the growth in the streaming market. The PwC report noted that the internet access revenue segment in Nigeria is expected to gain more market share in the next few years as a result of the growth in streaming adoption.\n\nRead Also: Spotify reveals Nigeria\u2019s top music cities, songs they love\n\nAdoption has brought visibility for many music artists in Nigeria. A list from Spotify puts Ckay the artist behind Love Nwantiti as the top streamed artist on Spotify in October 2021 with 7.62 million.\n\nOther artists in the top ten list include Wizkid (2.85 million); Burna Boy (2.83 million); Tems (1.72 million); Davido (710,500); Mr Eazi (619,100); Omay Lay (517,700); Rema (513,800); Joeboy (474,700); and Fireboy (417,000).\n\nCKay\u2019s Love Nwantiti remix with Joeboy and Kuami Eugene was the No 1 top song on YouTube with 69.6 million views as of the time of writing this article in November 2021. In the same month, Wizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos album peaked at No 4 on the Billboard World Albums Chart.\n\n\u201cIt peaked at No 1 and has expanded 51 weeks on the chart,\u201d Chart Africa, a firm that monitors the activities of African music across different platforms in the world, noted on Tuesday.\n\nFor many music artists in Nigeria music streaming is the best thing that happened to the industry and could be the future. Streaming, therefore, presents a lifeline to artists who continue to battle piracy.\n\n\u201cPiracy is one of the most common issues in the music industry, across almost all countries. As such, when Spotify enters new markets, education becomes a key driver. It is important for us to work with partners such as creators and the media to educate users on the benefits of legally streaming music and the positive impact that this has for creators and the economy,\u201d Phiona Okumu, Head of Music, sub-Saharan Africa, Spotify told BusinessDay.\n\nCurrently, the largest streaming service in Africa and Nigeria is Boomplay which has over 74 million users as of June 2021. However, the landscape is expanding with new investors like Spotify, Audiomack, and Amazon expanding their portfolio. Spotify, valued at $50 billion with over 345 million monthly active listeners, said launching in new markets like Nigeria is the next step to fulfilling its ongoing commitment to building a truly borderless audio ecosystem.\n\nDespite the boom, streaming however faces a difficult task in terms of conversion of consumers due to internet quality and dwindling income levels. Mobile penetration is at 40 percent with the coverage of 3G network below 60 percent and 4G at about 30 percent.\n\nNigeria is also on the list of countries where citizens work the most to buy 1GB of data. Nigerians have to work 33 hours 42 minutes to afford the cheapest broadband internet in a month, according to data from Surfshark. The global average is three hours 48 minutes a month.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics report on poverty puts the number of Nigerians living in extreme poverty at over 80 million. With the average Nigerian working 40 hours per week, it means they commit a total of 160 hours per month. In essence, 80 million Nigerians putting in about 160 hours to earn N30,000 per month, means each person earns an hourly wage of about N187.5. This is still less than the cheapest 1GB sold for N200.\n\nBut industry experts like Ogaga Sakpaide, a music executive and artist and repertoire consultant say streaming is the future of the music industry.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing history and change and it is something that is amazing to watch. I just hope that in the future everyone will be able to stream music and everyone will be able to consume music,\u201d Sakpaide said.",

          "text": "The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), has advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to address hiccups associated with the use of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), towards credible elections in the country.\n\nJibrin Ibrahim, Senior Fellow CDD and election analyst, Election Analysis Centre (EAC) said this when he addressed a news conference on the Anambra Governorship Election in Abuja on Monday.\n\nMr Ibrahim said that since technology was key to the electoral process, INEC must strive hard to get it right.\n\n\u201cINEC has to improve on technology and deployment skills, you cannot keep having these hitches each time you are deploying a news technology,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSam Amadi, CDD election analyst, said that the CDD deployed some observers to monitor the election and got findings on late arrival of election material and poll officials.\n\nMr Amadi said that poor welfare for security personnel, slow pace of transmission of results to the INEC Results Viewing portal (IREV) and fake news were some of the things observed.\n\n\u201cThe reported malfunction of the BVAS in most polling units has raised concerns about the reliability of the device; CDD believes that the intention behind the introduction of the BVAS is laudable.\n\n\u201cImportantly, the successful deployment of the device in many polling units demonstrates its utility and reliability.\n\n\u201cAs was experienced with the card reader at its inception stage, we are confident that INEC will seek solutions to the identified challenges with the device.\n\n\u201cHowever, INEC must take immediate measures to enhance the infrastructure behind the technology and ensure adequate training for Adhoc staff on the efficient use of the device,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Amadi said that the widely reported late arrival of INEC personnel and polling materials at polling units at over 65 per cent pointed to the need for the commission to review its logistics strategy, especially in conflict prone areas.\n\nHe said that CDD got information that some transporters refused to convey INEC staff and voting materials to the polling units even after receiving 50 per cent upfront payment, describing it as a reoccurring issue.\n\n\u201cThe CDD found out that the continuing trend of security agents\u2019 welfare not being given priority is disappointing, as it undervalues the humanity and service of those that put them in a situation where they could easily be compromised.\n\n\u201cThe Anambra election saw the weaponisation of fake news and disinformation to mislead, confuse or frighten the electorate in order to undermine their faith and participation for the election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the CDD believed that these demonstrated the need for info-vigilance with respect to elections.\n\n\u201cBut as we have seen, not only was the turnout in the 20 declared Local Government Areas (LGAs) disturbingly low (9.62 per cent), due to failure to hold election in Ihiala LGA.\n\n\u201cThe process has been declared inconclusive until Tuesday, Nov. 9, when we hope there will be a resolution.\n\n\u201cHow the supplementary election is handled will have significant implications not only for Anambra, but also for Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cWhile we await the conclusion of the process, there is need to share lessons from the Anambra experience that we believe will help to safeguard our democracy,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nClues, 2023\n\nMr Amadi said that CDD noted that the Anambra election has given a clue that the security challenge in the country could mar the 2023 elections, if not handled properly.\n\n\u201cThe CDD therefore, call on the Federal Government to take drastic measures to address security challenge in the country to ensure that the 2023 election is not undermined.\n\n\u201cWe further call on INEC, political parties and security agencies to ensure that the Nov. 9 supplementary election in Ihiala LGA is conducted with sincerity and within the electoral guidelines.\n\n\u201cThe CDD also call on the political class to recognise the connection between governance failure and voter apathy.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWinners of the 2020 edition of the prestigious Zik Prize Awards, were on Sunday, in a well attended ceremony held at Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, presented with the awards.\n\nAmong those honoured at the event are Nigeria\u2019s former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, who won Year 2020 Zik Prize in Public Service; Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who emerged winner of Zik Prize in Good Governance, alongside his Nasarawa State counterpart, Engineer Abdullahi Sule.\n\nHon. Minister of State for Health, Senator Olorunimbe Mamora, was presented with the Zik Prize in Political Leadership, while Group Managing Director of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kolo Kyari, received Zik Prize in Public Service.\n\nOther recipients of the award are: Mr U.K. Eke, MFR, Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings, winner of Zik Prize in Professional Leadership; Her Excellency, Mrs Ekaette Unoma Akpabio, Former First Lady of Akwa Ibom State, winner of Zik Prize in Humanitarian Leadership; Mr. Uche Orji, pioneer MD/CEO, of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Co winner of the 2020 Zik Prize in Professional Leadership; Dr Bashir Jamoh, Director General and CEO of the Nigerian Maritime and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Co winner of the year\u2019s Zik Prize in Public Service.\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the event, Sir Marc Wabara, member of the Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organizers of the award, recalled that the Zik Prize in Leadership Award scheme, was established in 1995, and has now evolved to become one of Africa\u2019s most respected award schemes in Africa.\n\nThe ceremony witnessed presentations from Emir of Kano, His Highness Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, Royal Father of the Day, who described the Late Nnamdi Azikiwe, in whose honour the award was instituted, as a worthy African statesman, while calling on the recipients of the award to continue to emulate his virtues.\n\nProf Anya O. Anya, Chairman of the Awards, noted that the scheme has come a long way, and called for its institutionalisation in the country.\n\nThe awardees in their respective remarks, expressed delight at being considered for the honour.\n\nAnyim in his speech, noted that being associated with Zik, whom he said, exemplified principled and committed leadership, is an honour to any Nigerian.\n\n\u201cTo be associated with the name Zik is a priceless honour to any Nigerian. The revered Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, exemplified principled, committed and focused leadership. Zik was an outstanding and charismatic leader. A passionate patriot; an unapologetic nationalist; a relentless defender of justice and an ardent believer in the unity of Nigeria. These qualities stood Zik and his fellow nationalists out as leaders who rose to the challenges of their time, who fought with all they had, liberated us from the shackles of colonialism and laid a solid foundation for a nation with every potential to be a strong and respected voice among the comity of nations. Nigeria now, more than ever before, is in urgent need of men and women who will think, act and live like Zik and his fellow nationalists. It is appropriate to always recall and honour the likes of Herbert Macaulay, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Michael Okpara, Chief Anthony Enahoro, Chief J.S Tarka, Chief Harold Dappa-Biriye, Alhaji Aminu Kano and the host of others,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn memory of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, I want to acknowledge and pay special tribute to all our Leaders, both dead and living, for the huge sacrifices they made to secure for us a free and independent nation. They were guided in their actions by what was best for the citizens of Nigeria. They provided leadership that inspired their followers. They faced daunting challenges but they overcame those challenges and achieved their objectives because of their commitment to building our nation. They understood that nation building is an arduous task. It calls for sacrifices, patience, tolerance, accommodation and consensus building. We need to imbibe the spirit that guided our leaders in the past.\u201d\n\nAnyim decried Nigeria\u2019s worsening economic and security challenges, noting that more than ever before, the country needs committed leadership that would rise to the challenge of the present.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the demand of leadership in the present-day Nigeria has become more daunting. For instance, our population has risen from about 45 million in 1960 to over 200 million in 2020. Most of that population are in the youthful bracket. Our economy has moved from the boom of the 1960s and 1970s to cycles of stunted growth and recession in the last decade. Our educational institutions have moved from the best rankings in the 1960s to mediocre positions in the 2020s,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur Naira has depreciated from 65 kobo to a dollar in the early 1980s to the present N568 to a dollar in 2021. Our labour market has moved from employment of choice in the 1970s to crises of underemployment and unemployment in the 2020s. In agriculture we have gone from a net exporter of food and cash crops to a nation of food insecurity and import dependence. Nigeria was founded on the principle of unity in diversity, but we are now more divided than ever in our history. Most of us will still remember when we were our brothers\u2019 keeper, but today danger lurks at every conner, nobody is safe anywhere.\n\n\u201cAround the world our image has shifted from the giant of African to what some say is the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cI will not belabour you with further reference to our national decline but I make haste to say that the leadership approach that will cope with these challenges must be beyond the usual. We need leadership that will change these challenges to a success story. Such leadership must have vision and capacity, be determined and above all be inclusive.\n\n\u201cPermit me to further mention that the challenges of leadership will be much more daunting as we move towards the 2nd quarter of the 21st Century (2026 \u2013 2050) due to the effects of the 4th industrial revolution popularly known as Industry 4.0. It has been described as \u201cthe next phase of dramatic technological expansion and social change\u201d. Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum puts it this way: \u201cThe possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, material science, energy storage and quantum computing\u201d.\n\nAnyim noted that, \u201cin the years ahead, for Nigeria to survive and thrive, we must have peace at home and respect abroad. For that, we need leadership that understands the challenges, the imperatives and concomitant of the 4th Industrial Revolution.\n\n\u201cWe need leaders that must connect and engage with the people especially the youth. Such leaders must place the youth at the center of every nation building effort in order to move them from the current valley of despair to the height of their potentials. We need leaders that can build societal consensus, repair our broken social fabrics and show deep empathy for all Nigerians that are suffering deprivation, poverty and want of any kind. Our leaders must be skilled in the science and art of good governance. They must be visionary and ready to keep pace with contemporary social, economic and technological changes. They must be pragmatic and result-driven in dealing with security, education, health and other myriad of challenges that confront our nation.\u201d\n\nAnyim, who had declared his intention to contest for president in 2023, restated his belief that Nigeria will turn the corner with the right leadership, while noting he has decided to offer himself to serve.\n\n\u201cAs an individual, I am offering myself for service. I am prepared to lead the charge, so that, together with other good men and women we will lead and unite Nigeria. We will heal our wounds and prosper all our people in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nIn his own remarks in a post after the presentation, Lagos State governor, Sanwo-Olu, noted that he accepted the award \u201cwith a greater sense of patriotism and commitment.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is a thing of utmost joy and honour to win an award named after Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, an iconic nationalist and erudite statesman whose life personified service.\n\n\u201cI accepted the award with a greater sense of patriotism and commitment to make the people we are elected to serve the centre of our administration in terms of policy conceptualisation and implementation.\n\n\u201cI will spend every day in office working for the people of Lagos on whose behalf I received the Zik Prize in Good Governance.\u201d",

          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has stated the need to reduce the substandard commodities in the market and encourage global acceptance of commodities produced in Nigeria.\n\nExecutive Commissioner Operations SEC, Mr. Dayo Obisan stated this during a Commodities Standards Sensitisation Workshop held in Lagos Monday.\n\nObisan said that it is globally recognized that the unique feature of the commodities exchange is the standardization of the commodities traded on the platform as each commodity traded on the exchange is graded by quality, size, weight and other criteria.\n\nHe said however that the determination of these grades and standards is dependent upon improved local standards which will take into cognizance internationally accepted standards.\n\n\u201cOn that note and in recognition of the fact that the statutory responsibility for standard setting in Nigeria lies in the Standards Organization of Nigeria. The Executive Management of the Commission on behalf of all stakeholders engaged with the management team of the Standards Organization of Nigeria, to ensure the expedited approval and publication of standards commodities.\n\n\u201cAs the establishment of relevant standards will significantly transform the Nigerian commodities trading ecosystem. Sequel to that engagement, the ecosystem roadmap implementation committee comprising key stakeholders has been working on the development of grading and standardization system.\n\n\u201cThe initial stage of the development process will concentrate on delivery of standards for agricultural commodities. In this regard, we are working with the SON to create awareness for existing agricultural commodities standard but more essentially to obtain feedback from you the stakeholders on the standards to be considered in this workshop and initiate a view of inadequate standards applicable.\n\nObisan said the SEC remains a strong advocate for a thriving commodities trading ecosystem. We strongly believe this is a project of national importance, given that that commodities exchanges value chain has significant value and can transform our economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs Nigerians thrive to achieve a sustainably diversified economy, given the current drive to guarantee food security, there is an urgent need for more complementary efforts from the government, regulators and critical stakeholders to ensure the approval and effective adoption of appropriate local standard benchmark against international practice to establish quality and reverse the unwarranted situation of perennial rejection of the Nigerian produced commodities.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore my expectation for this workshop and other stakeholders\u2019 engagement to serve as a rallying point for inclusive standards development process. As the ecosystem is driven towards standardization, the broader society will be impacted for greater prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe SEC as part of the implementation of the 10-year capital market master plan, constituted a technical committee in commodities trading ecosystem. The mandate of the committee was to identify challenges with the existing framework and develop a roadmap for a vibrant ecosystem.\n\nIn his remarks, Director General of SON, Mallam Farouk Salim said that\n\nthe organisation is willing to collaborate with relevant stakeholders\n\nin ensuring that the development of standards follows the best international principles of standard development as this would lead to improved lives of Nigerians.\n\nRepresented by Dr. Omolara Okunlola, Head Food Group, Salim said the organization is ensuring it promotes confidence of Nigerians in Nigerian produce and ensuring that SON in line with the various Federal Government policies, develops standards in such areas.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in history, we have the strategy already outlined under the Nigerian national standardization strategy. If you go through the strategy, you can see we have listed out standards to be developed, under agriculture, energy, transport, industry, a focus on SMEs, we also have for the health sector. The strategy is a living strategy, as policies from the government come up, we try to update the strategy \u201cshe stated.\n\nAlso speaking, Chairperson of the Commodities Trading Ecosystem Implementation Committee, Ms. Daisy Ekineh said with the strong global push for green economies and a net zero carbon emission, the era of fossil fuel in powering development is fast coming to an end hence, for an oil dependent economy like Nigeria, it is a race against time to effectively diversify the economy.\n\nEkineh said there is no doubt that efforts are on-going in this direction as evidenced by the various policies and programmes of government and the increasing contribution of the non-oil sectors to GDP which now exceeds 90% of GDP. Over 92% in Q2 2021.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe progress is commendable. Nonetheless, efforts need to be invigorated to speedily diversify the economy in all respect, for while the oil sector has shrunk in its contribution to GDP, it remains quite dominant in foreign exchange receipts and export trade. The economy is in other words, still mono product in some respect and significantly lacking in export diversification.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s import requirements, its foreign reserve build \u2013 up and budget funding are still largely dependent on crude oil receipts. This is clearly not sustainable and a major risk factor of the economy; being vulnerable to the vagaries of the global oil market.\n\n\u201cThe solution lies in the development of non- oil commodities like Agriculture and Solid Minerals which can have significant multiplier effect on the economy. If well developed, these sectors can provide steady industrial raw materials, create jobs, bolster export earnings and reduce demand for foreign exchange and generally facilitate industrial development, particularly the manufacturing sector.\n\nEkineh said the value chain for the commodities sector is quite huge and each aspect of the chain, creates its own sub value chain which in itself can significantly impact the economy.\n\nShe however said that the nation cannot optimally develop the commodities sector and its export trade without setting acceptance standards and grading for tradable commodities, be they for industrial use, export or otherwise. Such standards should be reviewed periodically and aligned with global best practice for international acceptability and export promotion.\n\n\u201cStandards and grading create trust, provide safety assurance and promote the integrity of the commodities market/sector as participants know exactly what the quality of a commodity is and can without doubt, purchase particular grade of commodities which suit their purpose. In other word, they know and have the assurance of what they are buying\u201d she added.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "title": "Chukwuma Soludo: The man who will be governor",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nIt is getting increasingly likely that the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chukwuma Soludo will emerge as the winner of the yet-to-be concluded Anambra State governorship election which commenced on Saturday.\n\nSoludo, who had earlier amassed more votes in each of the earlier announced six local government areas, has also led his opponents in two additional local government areas \u2013 Agwuata and Orumba North.\n\nHe won Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Aguata LGA, the three top contenders\u2019 native council. But the three gladiators had won in their respective polling units.\n\nIn a very likely event of the direction of victory remaining till the announcement of the final result, Soludo will begin to receive congratulatory messages for realizing an age-long dream of occupying the number one political office of Anambra State.\n\nIn a clime where corruption scandal is a common tag for public office holders, maintaining a spotless public image years after a five-year term of overseeing Nigeria\u2019s number one treasury house is not a common feat. That is the story of the last but one governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nSince leaving the CBN top job, the 60-year old professor of Economics has remained a star, meaning different things to different people who view him from the angles of excellence, integrity, performance or the rest of his core values.\n\nAs CBN governor, he demystified the banking sector, performing what most Nigerians thought was impossible, including the banking sector reform, a revolutionary recapitalization exercise that pruned operators with less than N25 billion capital base off the nation\u2019s banking landscape. The motive was to put an end to hitherto recurring bank liquidations that saw customers losing hard-earned deposits.\n\nThere is no gainsaying that the multiplier effect of that historic step was phenomenal as thousands of people secured jobs in the bigger banks that eventually emerged; many more jobs were created in companies financed by these bigger banks just as thousands of small, medium and large enterprises saw opportunities to access credit facilities from the banks. Also, hundreds of people that now have bureau de change and microfinance bank licenses, among others, owe their gratitude to the ingenuity of this radical economic thinker.\n\nSoludo served the federal government as chief economic adviser to former President Olusegum Obasanjo and chief executive officer of National Planning Commission during which he authored the economic agenda of the government called NEEDS.\n\nMany years down the line, the nation has not stopped tapping from his wealth of experience. Soludo currently serves as a member of the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) appointed by President Mohammadu Buhari, to replace the Economic Management Team of the federal government.\n\nEAC\u2019s mandate is to advise the president on economic policy matters, including fiscal analysis, economic growth and a range of internal and global economic issues working with the relevant cabinet members and heads of monetary and fiscal agencies.\n\nAn eminent patriot, Soludo has continued to contribute to nation building, taking positions on issues of serious national importance and proffering solutions to economic problems. For instance, in 2017, he insisted that Nigeria must take steps to eliminate the regime of multiple exchange rates, advising that the difference between the then official and parallel market exchange rates of the naira must be reduced to three to five per cent.\n\nOn the ravaging Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the erudite professor argued that it was wrong to adopt the \u2018cut and paste\u2019 approach to mitigating the pandemic in Nigeria and Africa. He advised African leaders to re-assess the total lockdown, insisting that the continent could not sustain a total economic shutdown. Arguing that the structures to support the lockdown in most African countries do not exist, he maintained that African leaders cannot continue to shut in citizens without food.\n\nWith a distinction in the West African School Certificate (WASC) from the Uga Boys Secondary School in Anambra State, a first class honours in Economics, MSc, PhD in Economics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and promoted professor at the age of 38, having met the requirements to be professor at 32, Soludo has proved to be a gifted solution provider to social and economic problems of the world in general and Nigeria in particular.\n\nA world class technocrat and scholar, Soludo had lived in Ethiopia, United Kingdom, USA and travelled to 45 other countries around the world as consultant to countries and about 20 international development and financial institutions even before the federal government called him to serve Nigeria. His advice saved many countries and created millions of jobs. His is a story of a man who has earned his place as a global citizen and still remains a humble village boy as he prefers to call himself.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the world has honoured him with scores of awards among which was the best governor of the central bank in Africa and in the world at the time. Even many years after leaving office, Soludo is still recognized as one of the 100 most influential Africans. In Nigeria, he has received over 100 awards and honours, including the third highest national honour, Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR).\n\nFormer President Obasanjo once described him as \u201cone of the leading lights of our nation whose leadership qualities are admirable and his willingness to listen and learn is simply infectious\u201d.",
          "summary": "That is the story of the last but one governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\nSoludo currently serves as a member of the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) appointed by President Mohammadu Buhari, to replace the Economic Management Team of the federal government.\nAn eminent patriot, Soludo has continued to contribute to nation building, taking positions on issues of serious national importance and proffering solutions to economic problems.\nArguing that the structures to support the lockdown in most African countries do not exist, he maintained that African leaders cannot continue to shut in citizens without food.\nEven many years after leaving office, Soludo is still recognized as one of the 100 most influential Africans.",

          "title": "Current Security Challenges Threaten Food Security \u2013 Magashi",
          "text": "The Minister of Defence, Major General Salihi Magashi (rtd), has raised the alarm over the prevailing security challenges in the country, saying it pose a threat to food security.\n\nMagashi stated this at the Defence Advisers/Attach\u00e9s annual conference organised by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Abuja.\n\nHe said that food security has been adversely affected by the attendant rise in the prices of foodstuff across the country which portends a new dimension of threat.\n\nMagashi said the ride of food prices makes it imperative for the various security agencies to continue to collaborate to tackle these menaces.\n\nThis according to him will create an enabling atmosphere for economic activities to thrive and to attract Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cA look at the security challenges in Nigeria today reveals new dimensions with increasing agitations for secession. In the North-East, attacks by Boko Haram Terrorists (BH) and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) continue to pose serious security threats in Nigeria. In the North-West and North-Central Zones, the activities of armed bandits, armed herders/militia attacks and kidnappers are prevalent.\n\n\u201cThe littoral states in the South-South region are plagued with illegal oil bunkering, piracy, and militancy while the South-East is challenged with secessionist activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\n\u201cThe South-West region is equally faced with secessionist inclination driven by ethnic agitators as well as occasional tension between herders and farmers. Distinguishing the threats Nigeria is currently facing and understanding their socio-geographic context is pivotal for adapting appropriate and lasting counter-measures.\u201d\n\nRegrettably, he said the prevalence of these threats has continued to endanger not only national security and economic growth but food security as well.\n\nIn particular, Magashi said it also means that the security agencies must explore all avenues within their respective systems to come up with innovative ways of identifying and confronting the challenges facing us as a nation.\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cI am aware that the Defence Advisers and Attach\u00e9s Conference is a vital mechanism through which the Defence Intelligence Agency evaluates, formulates, and reviews strategic policies.\n\n\u201cI am therefore elated to be in your midst for this year\u2019s Conference. The Conference, no doubt creates an avenue for performance evaluation and the improvement of our Defence Advisers/Attach\u00e9\u2019s system globally.\n\n\u201cI must say here that this Conference is novel because it will dovetail to the Agency\u2019s Retreat which is the first of its kind. I will also commend the Defence Attach\u00e9s/Advisers who have worked relentlessly in building a framework for a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria through rigorous defence networking with other countries of accreditation in these challenging times.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Defence Advisers/Attach\u00e9s system has crucial roles to play in this regard to forge the cooperation with the security and defence architectures in their respective countries of accreditation.\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt is for this reason that | find the theme of the 2021 Defence Advisers/Attach\u00e9s Annual Conference which is \u2018Advancing Counterterrorism Efforts through Enhanced Inter-Agency Cooperation: A Whole of Government Approach\u2019 as timely and very apt.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis Conference provides participants the opportunity to | appraise the shared vision of stemming the tide of insecurity through the integrated efforts of all government entities which is the objective of the whole of government approach.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative that you take advantage of the opportunities provided by your vantage positions to harness the potentials of the Defence Attach\u00e9 System in order to effectively contribute to the country\u2019s security efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the concept of Defence Attach\u00e9 System has come a long way in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cToday, we cover over 90 countries and four international organizations. The scope of your responsibilities has also increased from mere liaison with friendly nations to being the progenitors of contemporary defence diplomacy.\n\n\u201cNo doubt many countries including Nigeria have continued to devise new strategies for improved defence and security systems in order to meet up with ever evolving security challenges.\n\n\u201cThe recent achievements of the military and security agencies by taking the fight from all angles to the doorsteps of the adversaries is reassuring. Already, in the North East region alone, over 14,000 Boko Haram Terrorists have surrendered. Meanwhile, to support the country\u2019s surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Mr President has also approved the recruitment of 10,000 police officers annually by the Nigeria Police Force over the next 6 years. The launch of the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project are also visible efforts in confronting the myriad of security challenges that we have. All these efforts underscore the Government\u2019s_ political will to confront Nigeria\u2019s numerous challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Government is also exploring dialogue and mediation techniques in tackling other emerging threats such as the agitations by some ethnic nationalities and groups. This is also in tandem with the policy of this administration to entrench all-inclusiveness and good governance as part of democratic ideals.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), observed that Defence Attach\u00e9s are \u201cvaluable envoys\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe concept of Defence Attach\u00e9 System, which emerged in the Seventeenth Century enables countries to establish Defence representation with their allies. This gives the Attaches a key role in National Defence Diplomacy.\n\n\u201cFrom your reports, it is obvious that you have all been performing this role critically, especially as it relates to burning areas like defence and security sector reforms, complex peace support and civil emergency operations as well as counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism operations.\n\n\u201cInvariably, this is the reason why the country considers you all as critical stakeholders in surmounting the myriad of security challenges facing us.\u201d\n\nMonguno who was represented by Major General Abubakar Ndalolo, added, \u201cit is pertinent to mention that Nigeria has been adopting both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches in dealing with these security challenges. These approaches have been yielding results.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also lays emphasis on the integrated approach, which recognizes the roles of ministries, departments and agencies as well as the entire society in tackling our security challenges. This involves participation of critical stakeholders from different sectors of the society, such as religious actors, youths, teachers, women, civil society, media, law enforcement as well as the security and intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration is essential for building networks of peace that can create safe and resilient communities across Nigeria. It is for this reason that I find the theme of the 2021 Defence Attach\u00e9s/Advisers Annual Conference, which is \u2018Advancing Counter Terrorism Efforts Through Enhanced Inter-Agency Cooperation: A Whole of Government Approach\u2019, very apt. There is no doubt that the communique that will be reached at the end of this conference would enhance Government\u2019s effort towards strengthening of institutions, enhancing access to justice, observance of the rule of law and human rights, and employing strategic communication during counter terrorism operations\u201d.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General SA Adebayo, explained that \u201cthe Defence Advisers and Attach\u00e9s Conference is an annual event which affords the Agency a good medium to assiduously review the activities of all its Defence Sections. The Conference is also an avenue to identify new lessons and challenges, discuss modalities for overcoming such challenges as well as restrategize for the future.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the conference comes at a time when the nation is facing unusual daunting security challenges characterised by a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this regard that I urge the participants of this Conference to address the issues squarely and deliberate with open minds to ensure that the objectives of the Conference are achieved,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "The Minister of Defence, Major General Salihi Magashi (rtd), has raised the alarm over the prevailing security challenges in the country, saying it pose a threat to food security.\nAccording to him, \u201cA look at the security challenges in Nigeria today reveals new dimensions with increasing agitations for secession.\nIn the North-East, attacks by Boko Haram Terrorists (BH) and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) continue to pose serious security threats in Nigeria.\nThe launch of the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project are also visible efforts in confronting the myriad of security challenges that we have.\n\u201cThe federal government also lays emphasis on the integrated approach, which recognizes the roles of ministries, departments and agencies as well as the entire society in tackling our security challenges.",

          "text": "A fallout of the Anambra governorship election is that the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Andy Uba has become an object of ridicule, his credibility bashed.\n\nFortunately, Uba has no political opponent to blame for his mockery. He contrived it himself, in collusion with Governor Dapo Abiodun\n\nOn 26 June, 2021, Uba claimed to have won 230, 201 votes from APC members in the primary election, conducted by Abiodun.\n\nWith the votes credited to 13 other candidates, the APC recorded 348,630 voters in the primary election.\n\nThe voters were understandably members of the party on its register.\n\nFive months after, the election held on 6 November.\n\nAndy Uba was thoroughly thrashed by Professor Chukwuma Soludo, the candidate of APGA, the ruling party in the state. .\n\nUba with his 230,201 primary electors, ended up not second, but third in the contest, with around 42,942 votes.\n\nYou then wonder, where were Uba\u2019s supporters, who overwhelmingly gave him the ticket in June.\n\nDid they vote APGA or PDP? If you believe this, you will believe anything.\n\nThe truth is that those voters did not exist in the first place. They were ghosts, fictionally created.\n\nThe APC does not have anything near 348,630 members in Anambra that took part in the primary.\n\nRemember the cry of the losers: there was no primary election ever held by the APC in the state.\n\nBut this cry was muffled as the party upheld what is now clearly a fictional result submitted by Dapo Abiodun electoral committee.\n\nWithout any iota of contradiction, the committee simply wrote the figures and allotted the votes whimsically.\n\nPoliticians play this game often, lying insistently about an election that did not hold and votes that were never cast.\n\nINEC conduct of the election has now confirmed what the other APC candidates complained about.\n\nIndeed the entire number of votes in the highly contested election in the state will be slightly higher than the 230,000 recorded by Uba in June, even with the make-up election held in two councils today.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has accused Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami of bias in his handling of the disputed $418 million allegedly owed private contractors and firms by the 36 States and Local Governments in relation to the Paris Club refund.\n\nThe NGF wondered why as a public officer, Malami was eager to ensure public funds were transferred to private individuals and entities even when the alleged debt was being disputed and currently subject of pending litigations.\n\nNGF Head, Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, said this in a statement Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe governors faulted Malami\u2019s claim that the federal government was right to have deducted the $418million from the accounts of the 36 states to settle the alleged debt.\n\nThe governors, who faulted some payments already made to some individuals and entities, further argued that the AGF, being a public officer ought to be driven by the need to protect public interest and ensure that public funds are not unjustly transferred to private individuals and interests with doubtful claims.\n\nThe governors\u2019 reaction followed a statement last Friday by the AGF\u2019s media aide, Umar Gwandu, where he attempted justifying the federal government\u2019s planned deduction of the sum to settle private contractors and/or consultants for alleged work done in relation to the Paris Club Refunds to the States and Local Governments.\n\nThe governors said: \u201cThe decision by the HAGF to throw his weight behind these consultants who have been battling desperately to grab $418m from the accounts of states and local governments raises questions of propriety and the spirit of justice.\n\n\u201cThe HAGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste, with which the statement was issued even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated 5th November, 2021restraining the Federal Government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the Office of the HAGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the HAGF as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation is statutorily bound to always protect.\n\n\u201cThe statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday not only unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\n\n\u201cThe media aide to the HAGF justifies the deductions on the basis that they are made pursuant to four court judgments; two of which are consent judgments and/or that the NGF/States and LGAs consented, expressed no objection to the payments and had already paid part of the debts to the said contractors and consultants.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the media aide to the HAGF however conveniently and deliberately failed to name the judgments under reference and whether they are on appeal or challenged in any other way.\n\n\u201cHe also failed to specify which of the four judgments authorized payments and in what proportion to each of the contractors.\n\n\u201cWhile it is very easy to argue as the AGF does, that the NGF and ALGON took no early steps to appeal as they should have done, it is important to inform the Nigerian public that State governors have since appealed and are challenging the judgments in various courts.\n\n\u201cInterestingly the AGF has been served all these processes, nevertheless, this was ignored and payment was authorized to be made and has been processed with unprecedented speed not common in the public service.\n\n\u201cIt must be stated that between the NGF and AGF, the latter is in more vantage constitutional position and has a legal responsibility and burden to defend public interest.\n\n\u201cThe AGF should have therefore initiated appeals against the said judgments once his attention was drawn to them, because public interest was at stake involving huge sums of money meant for the provision of public services.\u201d\n\nThey further said: \u201cIt must be noted that the state governments were not parties to any of the said judgments. It should be further stated that the Office of the AGF failed to professionally defend the cases leading to those judgments and the courts commented on that unprofessional attitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we are constrained not to comment on a subject which is sub-judice, we have a responsibility to the public to respond in some detail to the statement issued by the Office of the AGF in order to put the records straight.\n\n\u201cAny discerning legal mind would find no difficulty in concluding that the so-called judgments under reference are dripping with too many irregularities bordering on competence and lack of jurisdiction which are the bases why some of them are being challenged on appeal and in other courts. No diligent public officer would act on such judgments by recommending payment.\n\n\u201cIt is even more curious that the AGF also recommended payments to some contractors allegedly based on Judgments that did not make any monetary award or on claims that were struck out.\n\n\u201cThe AGF may need to explain to Nigerians why these particular judgment debts are given unusual attention and priority and processed with supersonic speed over and above all others; some of which preceded these so-called judgments and have been pending for settlement by the AGF for several years.\n\n\u201cWhile it is convenient to say that part of these judgment debts have been paid with the release of USD$86,546, 526.65 and N19, 439,225,871.11 in 2016 and $100m in 2018 to the contractors with the concurrence of the NGF; that does not detract from the fact that they were payments wrongly made which ought not to have been made even if they were products of consent Judgments. States can still go after the contractors to recover the funds wrongly made.\n\n\u201cIt should concern the HAGF that ALGON disowned the contracts claimed by RIOK and the same was duly communicated to him requesting him to prevent the use of LG funds to \u201csettle dubious and illegal claims\u201d\n\nThe statement further asked: \u201cWas the AGF not concerned that several contractors are laying claim to legal fees for the same Paris Club Refund? Was it lost on the AGF on the detailed procedure available under the law how legal fees can be claimed in deserving cases?\n\n\u201cOne of the strange payments made is that of USD$47,831,920 million to Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd/George Uboh for allegedly reviewing a 16-page judgment for the then factional NGF. Can the Office of the HAGF point to any consent judgment awarding that sum to PANIC Alert? Did the NGF\u2019s letter of 20th January, 2020 relied upon by the HAGF ever recommend the payment of any sum?\n\n\u201cLINAS and NED Nwoko in this scheme are walking away with US$68,658,193.83 state funds allegedly for legal consultancy services. Is the AGF not aware that the work alleged to have been done by him was already contained in a FAAC Reconciliation Committee Report constituted in 2005 submitted in 2007 with recommendations on how states and LGAs should be refunded the over charges from the Paris Club Refunds.\n\n\u201cDr. Ted Iseghohi-Edwards has been paid the sum of USD$159m in promissory notes, yet he had his matter in Suit No FCT/HC/CV/1353/18 struck out on November 10th, 2020.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the legal basis for his claim is rooted in SUIT NO FHC/ABJ/CS/130/13: LINAS INTERNATIONAL LTD & 235 ORS V FGN which clearly stated that he cannot benefit under the judgment because he was not a party in the case and cannot enforce the terms of the judgment. Contrary to the representation of the AGF, the EFCC\u2019s report on TED was negative.\n\n\u201cThe report not only recommended his arrest but a forfeiture of any of his assets associated with the Paris Club Refund. The AGF ignored these recommendations.\n\n\u201cRIOK to whom the AGF supports and recommends the payment of USD$142,028,941.95 was also excluded by Justice Ademola in the Judgment in the LINAS case. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Appeal No CA/558/2017.\n\n\u201cThat is the appeal now before the Supreme Court (SC). Which Judgment then is the basis of the AGF recommendation that RIOK be paid the sum of $142, 028,941.95. There is also no evidence of execution of any contract by RIOK. Curiously, the Department of State Security (DSS) is alleged to have confirmed 50% execution.\n\n\u201cThe Court and EFCC stated clearly that it is not the responsibility of the DSS to ascertain the execution of contracts as they do not have the expertise. ALGON disowned the contracts. Why will the AGF insist on them? It is not true that the EFCC in its report recommended payment to the contractors. It did not.\n\n\u201cIn the case of payments recommended and paid to Prince Orji Nwafor Orizu US$1,219,440.45, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 US$215,195.36, it remains a mystery. These two lawyers are alleged to have performed legal services for RIOK and its associated companies and not for the states or LGAs. Why they are paid from State resources is only imagined.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also claims he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid execution of the judgments against the federal government resources. That is absolutely not true at all. Assets of the FGN were not at any time threatened.\n\n\u201cThe NGF is not aware that there is any existing mandamus issued by any court in favour of the contractors against the Federal Government. The only application for mandamus by PANIC Alert is pending for hearing at the Federal High Court and parties have since joined issues.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also says that the NGF and LGAs seek to transfer their liability to the FGN. That is not true. There is no liability to transfer in the first place and none exists; neither has the NGF provided any undertaking or indemnity to the FGN to act on its behalf as represented by the AGF.\n\n\u201cThe AGF has consistently stated that this administration is an avid respecter of the rule of law. This is one case in which this commitment should be fully and completely demonstrated. Let the AGF remain neutral and protect scarce public resources.\n\n\u201cLet him advise the contractors to wait until all appeals and litigations in court are concluded. That is the true test of observing the rule of law. There is no other way, uncomfortable as that would appear.\n\n\u201cState resources needed for critical development should not under any guise be frittered away as payments for contracts whose veracity and authenticity is still a subject of litigation and disputation.\n\n\u201cThese contractors are impecunious and cannot restitute the states/LGAs if the appeals or other litigation are determined against them.\n\n\u201cWe call on the general public to be alert and vigilant. The debt relief granted Nigeria by the Paris Club in 2005 was meant to enable her have a respite and use the resources saved for meaningful development.\n\n\u201cIt was not for distribution to private persons to fund their luxurious lives; neither can Nigeria justify her borrowing funds all over the world to fund capital projects and turn round to disburse state resources to individuals in a manner that offends all public sensibilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge all those appointed as gatekeepers to our laws to ensure that the laws of our land are respected and protected. Let professionalism, reasonable caution and due diligence prevail on this matter, please.\u201d",

          "text": "The federal government Monday declared planned investigation into contracts allegedly signed by previous administrations with Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID).\n\nThe contracts put at $10 billion, it said, were in breach of due process and procedure and capable of undermining the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nMinister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) stated this while appearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters for 2022 budget defence session.\n\nIn January 2017, an independent London tribunal found that Nigeria was liable for $6.6 billion in damages against P&ID after it failed to deliver on terms agreed in a 2010 gas facility contract.\n\nAnd in a bid to get the ruling enforced three years later, P&ID got another ruling from a United Kingdom (U.K.) court that Nigeria\u2019s state-owned assets could be seized if the country refused to settle its bill which had risen to $9.6 billion because of accrued interest.\n\nNigeria was however in 2020 granted the right to appeal the judgement but asked to pay $200 million in the meantime.\n\nWhile responding to questions from members of the committee chaired by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele by (APC Ekiti Central) on the case, Malami said P&ID contract was never allowed to pass through the office of the Attorney General and that the contract clauses were inimical to Nigeria\u2019s interest.\n\nAccording to him, a taskforce already set up for thorough findings on the contracts signed against the interest of the country by previous administrations, would spend N1.1 billion in 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is the taskforce that is intended to review the existing problematic contracts that have the capacity to undermine the economy as far as the P&ID is concerned.\n\n\u201cIn the office of the Attorney General, there exists two fundamental departments relating to vetting of contracts. Solicitor Department is charged with vetting any governmental contract and they have lived up to expectations over time.\n\n\u201cBut the major problem with P&ID is that contract was never ever allowed to pass through the Office of the Attorney General for vetting. So, on account of that, there are clauses embedded in the contract that are inimical to the interest of the nation.\n\n\u201cBecause of the fact\n\nthat there is a preliminary conspiracy among the key promoters of the contract, the contract was never allowed to pass through the Federal Executive Council (FEC) for its approval, neither was it allowed to pass through the Federal Ministry of Justice for vetting.\n\n\u201cThe existing structures are there, but they can only act in respect of contracts that are referred to the department.\n\n\u201cFor example, as it is now, even though in respect of government contracts, arising from the fact that China is involving certain clauses regarding immunity which some ministries and departments are willing to compromise, they are not allowed to pass.\n\n\u201cWe have developed need for other circulars that these are intended clauses that could be tolerated in public interest and the interest of the nation in mind were attached. What I\u2019m saying in essence is that the taskforce is poised at looking at it.\n\n\u201cIn respect of P&ID, there were about nine contracts that were signed at the same time in breach of due processes and procedures.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the committee chairman, Senator Bamidele lamented soaring judgement debts which, according to him, had become national embarrassment, and called for urgent action to arrest the situation. .\n\nBamidele said: \u201cIt is also pertinent to state that the judgement debt profile of the country keeps soaring without corresponding response from government in order to address the situation.\n\n\u201cThis development is now viewed as a national embarrassment and necessary action must be taken to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I implore you prioritise your budget and make a case for legislative intervention where necessary, in order to ensure that this area of concern is critically looked into, with a view to proffering the much needed solution.\u201d\n\nThe ministry proposed N11.8 billion for 2022 budget with personnel cost taking N3.9 billion, overhead cost (exclusive of legal services) \u2013 N2.4billion, legal services \u2013 N2 billion and capital budget- N3.5 billion.",

Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

          "title": "Governors Accuse Malami Of Supporting Consultants In $418m Paris Club Payments",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) on Monday said the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation (HAGF), Abubakar Malami, was working against the public\u2019s interest by insisting on the payment of $418 million to private consultants from the accounts of state governments.\n\nThe consultants are claiming a percentage of Paris Club refunds as payment of services they said they rendered to the states and local government.\n\nThe Federal Government had determined to pay the consultants from state accounts but a Federal High Court on Friday restrained it from making such deductions until all issues relating to that matter were fully determined.\n\nIn a statement signed by the spokesman of the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation, Umar Gwandu, on Friday, the AGF suggested the states and local governments had acted in bad faith for taking the case to court.\n\nREAD ALSO: No Violation In Process To Deduct $418m From States\u2019 Account \u2013 AGF\n\nThe deductions were ratified by several court judgements, the AGF said, and the Federal Government only had to step in to avoid forfeiting any of its assets, since it was also a defendant in the lawsuits against the states.\n\nBut on Monday, the NGF, in a statement signed by its spokesperson Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, said the AGF\u2019s actions \u201craises questions of propriety and the spirit of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe HAGF is supposed to be the chief arbiter in all matters concerning Nigerians, especially the poor masses of this country. It is incumbent upon him to, not just ensure that justice is done, but that justice is seen to have been done,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe undue haste, with which the statement was issued even before the service on the AGF of the court processes and the order dated 5th November, 2021restraining the Federal Government, seems to suggest that there is a special relationship between the Office of the HAGF and the consultants over and above Nigerian citizens, whose interest the HAGF as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation is statutorily bound to always protect. The statement also suggests that the restraining order issued last Friday not only unsettled preconceived plans and angered the unnamed \u2018government officers\u2019 referred to by the media aide.\n\n\u201cThe media aide to the HAGF justifies the deductions on the basis that they are made pursuant to four court judgments; two of which are consent judgments and/or that the NGF/States and LGAs consented, expressed no objection to the payments and had already paid part of the debts to the said contractors and consultants. The statement by the media aide to the HAGF however conveniently and deliberately failed to name the judgments under reference and whether they are on appeal or challenged in any other way. He also failed to specify which of the four judgments authorized payments and in what proportion to each of the contractors.\n\n\u201cWhile it is very easy to argue as the AGF does, that the NGF and ALGON took no early steps to appeal as they should have done, it is important to inform the Nigerian public that State governors have since appealed and are challenging the judgments in various courts. Interestingly the AGF has been served all these processes, nevertheless, this was ignored and payment was authorized to be made and has been processed with unprecedented speed not common in the public service. It must be stated that between the NGF and AGF, the latter is in more vantage constitutional position and has a legal responsibility and burden to defend public interest. The AGF should have therefore initiated appeals against the said judgments once his attention was drawn to them, because public interest was at stake involving huge sums of money meant for the provision of public services. It must be noted that the state governments were not parties to any of the said judgments. It should be further stated that the Office of the AGF failed to professionally defend the cases leading to those judgments and the courts commented on that unprofessional attitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we are constrained not to comment on a subject which is sub-judice, we have a responsibility to the public to respond in some detail to the statement issued by the Office of the AGF in order to put the records straight. Any discerning legal mind would find no difficulty in concluding that the so-called judgments under reference are dripping with too many irregularities bordering on competence and lack of jurisdiction which are the bases why some of them are being challenged on appeal and in other courts. No diligent public officer would act on such judgments by recommending payment.\u201d\n\nThe NGF also noted that the AGF had recommended payments to some contractors allegedly based on judgments that did \u201cnot make any monetary award or on claims that were struck out.\n\n\u201cThe AGF may need to explain to Nigerians why these particular judgment debts are given unusual attention and priority and processed with supersonic speed over and above all others; some of which preceded these so-called judgments and have been pending for settlement by the AGF for several years.\n\n\u201cWhile it is convenient to say that part of these judgment debts have been paid with the release of USD$86,546,526.65 and N19,439,225,871.11 in 2016 and $100m in 2018 to the contractors with the concurrence of the NGF; that does not detract from the fact that they were payments wrongly made which ought not to have been made even if they were products of consent Judgments. States can still go after the contractors to recover the funds wrongly made. It should concern the HAGF that ALGON disowned the contracts claimed by RIOK and the same was duly communicated to him requesting him to prevent the use of LG funds to \u2018settle dubious and illegal claims\u2019\n\n\u201cWas the AGF not concerned that several contractors are laying claim to legal fees for the same Paris Club Refund? Was it lost on the AGF on the detailed procedure available under the law how legal fees can be claimed in deserving cases?\n\n\u201cOne of the strange payments made is that of USD$47,831,920 million to Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd/George Uboh for allegedly reviewing a 16-page judgment for the then factional NGF. Can the Office of the HAGF point to any consent judgment awarding that sum to PANIC Alert? Did the NGF\u2019s letter of 20th January, 2020 relied upon by the HAGF ever recommend the payment of any sum?\n\n\u201cLINAS and NED Nwoko in this scheme are walking away with US$68,658,193.83 state funds allegedly for legal consultancy services. Is the AGF not aware that the work alleged to have been done by him was already contained in a FAAC Reconciliation Committee Report constituted in 2005 submitted in 2007 with recommendations on how states and LGAs should be refunded the over charges from the Paris Club Refunds.\n\n\u201cDr. Ted Iseghohi-Edwards has been paid the sum of USD$159m in promissory notes, yet he had his matter in Suit No FCT/HC/CV/1353/18 struck out on November 10th, 2020. Furthermore, the legal basis for his claim is rooted in SUIT NO FHC/ABJ/CS/130/13: LINAS INTERNATIONAL LTD & 235 ORS V FGN which clearly stated that he cannot benefit under the judgment because he was not a party in the case and cannot enforce the terms of the judgment. Contrary to the representation of the AGF, the EFCC\u2019s report on TED was negative. The report not only recommended his arrest but a forfeiture of any of his assets associated with the Paris Club Refund. The AGF ignored these recommendations.\n\n\u201cRIOK to whom the AGF supports and recommends the payment of USD$142,028,941.95 was also excluded by Justice Ademola in the Judgment in the LINAS case. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Appeal No CA/558/2017. That is the appeal now before the Supreme Court (SC). Which Judgment then is the basis of the AGF recommendation that RIOK be paid the sum of $142,028,941.95. There is also no evidence of execution of any contract by RIOK. Curiously, the Department of State Security (DSS) is alleged to have confirmed 50% execution. The Court and EFCC stated clearly that it is not the responsibility of the DSS to ascertain the execution of contracts as they do not have the expertise. ALGON disowned the contracts. Why will the AGF insist on them? It is not true that the EFCC in its report recommended payment to the contractors. It did not.\n\n\u201cIn the case of payments recommended and paid to Prince Orji Nwafor Orizu US$1,219,440.45, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 US$215,195.36, it remains a mystery. These two lawyers are alleged to have performed legal services for RIOK and its associated companies and not for the states or LGAs. Why they are paid from State resources is only imagined.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also claims he intervened to pay the contractors to avoid execution of the judgments against the federal government resources. That is absolutely not true at all. Assets of the FGN were not at any time threatened. The NGF is not aware that there is any existing mandamus issued by any court in favour of the contractors against the Federal Government. The only application for mandamus by PANIC Alert is pending for hearing at the Federal High Court and parties have since joined issues.\n\n\u201cThe AGF also says that the NGF and LGAs seek to transfer their liability to the FGN. That is not true. There is no liability to transfer in the first place and none exists; neither has the NGF provided any undertaking or indemnity to the FGN to act on its behalf as represented by the AGF.\n\n\u201cThe AGF has consistently stated that this administration is an avid respecter of the rule of law. This is one case in which this commitment should be fully and completely demonstrated. Let the AGF remain neutral and protect scarce public resources. Let him advice the contractors to wait until all appeals and litigations in court are concluded. That is the true test of observing the rule of law. There is no other way, uncomfortable as that would appear. State resources needed for critical development should not under any guise be frittered away as payments for contracts whose veracity and authenticity is still a subject of litigation and disputation. These contractors are impecunious and cannot restitute the states/LGAs if the appeals or other litigation are determined against them.\n\n\u201cWe call on the general public to be alert and vigilant. The debt relief granted Nigeria by the Paris Club in 2005 was meant to enable her have a respite and use the resources saved for meaningful development. It was not for distribution to private persons to fund their luxurious lives; neither can Nigeria justify her borrowing funds all over the world to fund capital projects and turn round to disburse state resources to individuals in a manner that offends all public sensibilities.\n\n\u201cWe urge all those appointed as gatekeepers to our laws to ensure that the laws of our land are respected and protected. Let professionalism, reasonable caution and due diligence prevail on this matter, please.\u201d",

          "text": "Sudan\u2019s army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has said he will not participate in any government that comes after a transitional period and denied that the army was responsible for the deaths of protesters rallying against the military takeover.\n\nNationwide anti-coup protests have taken place since the October 25 power grab by the army, but have been met by a deadly crackdown.\n\nAt least 14 demonstrators have been killed and about 300 wounded, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors.\n\n\u201cIt is our pledge \u2013 a pledge we made to ourselves, the Sudanese people and the international community \u2013 that we are committed to completing the democratic transition, holding elections on time, and committed to not stopping any political activity as long as it is peaceful, and within the bounds of the constitutional declaration and the parts that have not been suspended,\u201d al-Burhan told Al Jazeera in comments broadcast on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to handing over power to a civilian government of national competency and we pledge to preserve the transition from any interference that can hinder it,\u201d he continued.\n\nAl-Burhan also denied the army was responsible for the deaths of protesters.\n\n\u201cThe Sudanese army does not kill citizens, and there are investigation committees to reveal what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe interview was broadcast as anti-coup rallies continued in the capital, Khartoum and several other towns, ramping up the pressure against the military amid the continuing political crisis.\n\nDozens of teachers rallied against the army outside the education ministry in Khartoum. According to the teachers\u2019 union, at least 80 protesters were arrested in Khartoum on Sunday. There were no reports of casualties.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Resul Serdar, who spoke with Burhan, said the general said people have the right to protest peacefully.\n\n\u201cBurhan said the talks are underway with political parties and figures including the ousted prime minister Abdalla Hamdok [regarding] reaching a consensus to forming a government,\u201d Serdar said, speaking from Khartoum.\n\n\u201cHe said he hopes to reach a deal within the next 24 hours, despite several obstacles.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Sudanese security forces fired tear gas at several anti-coup rallies, with protesters in several cities joining a call for two days of civil disobedience and a strike campaign to protest against last month\u2019s military takeover.\n\nThe calls for civil disobedience were led by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), an umbrella of unions which were also instrumental in the protests which led to the removal of longtime strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.\n\n\u201cThe Sudanese people have rejected the military coup,\u201d the SPA said, vowing \u201cno negotiation, no partnership\u201d.\n\nThe SPA\u2019s appeals for civil disobedience were circulated via text messages, to bypass internet outages in place since the putsch.\n\nHundreds of anti-coup protesters rallied in Khartoum, as well as in its twin city of Omdurman, Wad Madni to the south, and the northern city of Atbara.\n\n\u201cThe authority belongs to the people,\u201d they chanted and \u201cno, no to military rule\u201d as they demanded a \u201ccivilian government\u201d.\n\n\u201cProtesters barricaded the streets, set car tyres ablaze, called out against the military rule, and chanted that civilian government is the people\u2019s choice,\u201d said Hoda Othman, who witnessed protests in Omdurman.\n\nThe military takeover sparked international condemnation, including punitive aid cuts and demands for a swift return to civilian rule.\n\nAl-Burhan insists it \u201cwas not a coup\u201d but a move to \u201crectify the course of the transition\u201d.\n\nThe commander of the powerful Rapid Support Forces, who is the No. 2 man in Sudan\u2019s military, came out in support of the takeover in a midnight speech posted on Facebook.\n\nGeneral al-Burhan\u2019s moves \u201ccame to correct the course of the people\u2019s revolution, and preserve the security and stability of the country,\u201d said General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, Burhan\u2019s deputy on the now-dissolved Sovereign Council.\n\nSeparately on Sunday, a high-level Arab League delegation held separate talks with al-Burhan and the deposed civilian leader, Abdalla Hamdok, on \u201cthe importance of the partnership between the military and civilians\u201d and ways to \u201cresolve the disagreements\u201d.\n\nHamdok, who is still under house arrest in his residence in Khartoum, has insisted on releasing government officials and politicians detained in connection with the coup. He also wants \u201cguarantees\u201d that the military would return to the pre-coup power-sharing arrangements, the official said.\n\nOn Thursday, the military released four civilian members of the government but key officials are still detained.",

We\u2019ve got conflict, climate change and COVID-19 driving up the numbers of the acutely hungry,\u201d WFP Executive Director David Beasley was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cAnd the latest data show there are now more than 45 million people marching towards the brink of starvation,\u201d he said after a trip to Afghanistan, where WFP is upping support for almost 23 million people.\n\n\u201cFuel costs are up, food prices are soaring, fertiliser is more expensive, and all of this feeds into new crises like the one unfolding now in Afghanistan, as well as longstanding emergencies like Yemen and Syria,\u201d he added.\n\nWFP said the cost of averting famine globally now stands at $7bn, up from $6.6bn earlier in the year, but warned that traditional funding streams were overstretched.\n\nFamilies facing acute food insecurity are being \u201cforced to make devastating choices\u201d, marrying off children early, pulling them out of school or feeding them locusts, wild leaves, or cactus.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile media reports from Afghanistan point to families reportedly being forced to sell their children in a desperate attempt to survive,\u201d it said.\n\nMultiple droughts in Afghanistan were combining with an economic meltdown to push families to the edge, while some 12.4 million people in Syria do not know where their next meal will come from \u2013 more than any time during the decade-long conflict, it said.\n\nIncreases in acute hunger are also being seen in Ethiopia, Haiti, Somalia, Angola, Kenya, and Burundi, the Rome-based agency said.",

          "text": "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen took a dominant victory in the Mexico City Grand Prix to strengthen his chances of a first World Championship.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s title rival Lewis Hamilton was second, the Mercedes driver holding off a charge from Verstappen\u2019s team-mate Sergio Perez in the closing laps.\n\nPerez was on Hamilton\u2019s tail on the last lap but was not able to pass.\n\nVerstappen\u2019s ninth win in 2021 gives him a 19-point lead with four races and a total of 107 points remaining.\n\nHamilton\u2019s team-mate Valtteri Bottas deprived the Dutchman of the point for fastest lap on the final tour.\n\nOne of the most imposing victories of the year, therefore, puts Verstappen in a commanding position in the championship.\n\nAnd a one-three finish moved Red Bull to just one point behind Mercedes in the constructors\u2019 championship.\n\nAfter Mercedes surprisingly locked out the front row on Saturday, Verstappen immediately put himself in a position to win by taking the lead at the first corner.\n\nBenefiting from the tow behind the two Mercedes, and then slotting into a gap left by Bottas on the outside on the run from the grid, Verstappen braked later than both Mercedes drivers and swept around their outside into a lead he never looked like losing.\n\n\u201cIt was all about braking late,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cI kept it on the track and that basically made my race.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the move, Bottas was tipped into a spin by McLaren\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo, relegating him to the back and taking him out of the picture. To add insult to injury, Bottas rejoined from a pit stop for tyres on lap one behind Ricciardo and could not pass him for the next 30 laps or so.\n\nMercedes stopped him late in the race to set the fastest lap and limit Verstappen\u2019s haul by one point.\n\nVerstappen pulled away from Hamilton so commandingly that the suspicion was he would have won even if he had not taken the lead at the start.\n\nAs it was, he had an untroubled drive, pulling nearly 10 seconds clear of Hamilton by the time the world champion made his pit stop on lap 29.\n\nMercedes stopped Hamilton on that lap because he was beginning to come under threat from Perez and they wanted to \u2018bank\u2019 track position.\n\nRed Bull then left Perez out for a further 11 laps to give him fresher tyres with which to come back at Hamilton in the second stint.\n\nPerez was within a second of Hamilton with 11 laps to go.\n\nThere were a few nervous moments as Hamilton came up to lap McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris but was not close enough to pass until the younger Briton eventually got some blue flags. But once clear of Norris Hamilton always looked to have Perez under control.\n\nHamilton said: \u201cTheir car was so superior this weekend that there wasn\u2019t really anything we could do about it. I am just happy to have second.\u201d\n\nIt was a largely uneventful race behind the leaders.\n\nPierre Gasly had a strong but lonely race in the Alpha Tauri, starting fifth and running fourth throughout.\n\nHe had the measure of the Ferraris behind. For a long time, the lead red car was Charles Leclerc, but his team-mate Carlos Sainz made a later pit stop even than Perez and Leclerc let him by in the later laps to give him a shot at chasing down Gasly.\n\nWhen the Spaniard was unable to catch him, the Ferraris swapped back with a handful of laps to go, promoting Leclerc back to fifth ahead of Sainz.\n\nAston Martin\u2019s Sebastian Vettel took seventh, ahead of Alfa Romeo\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen, Alpine\u2019s Fernando Alonso and Norris.",
