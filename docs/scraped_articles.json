          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nMedical experts say the fear of litigation and patients\u2019 demand are among the major factors influencing the rising incidence of caesarean section in the world.\n\nThe experts, President, Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria, Prof. Oluwarotimi Akinola; and the Chairman, Lagos State chapter of SOGON, Dr. Joseph Akinde said that safety concerns also influence the decision to perform CS, rather than aim for vaginal birth.\n\nAccording to a new research from the World Health Organisation, CS use continues to rise globally, now accounting for more than 1 in 5 (21 percent) of all childbirths.\n\nThis number is set to continue increasing over the coming decade, with nearly a third (29 percent) of all births likely to take place by caesarean section by 2030, the research finds.\n\nWHO said worldwide caesarean section rates have risen from around 7 percent in 1990 to 21 percent as of last Wednesday and are projected to continue increasing over this current decade.\n\nWHO recommends the national CS rate to be between 10 and 15 percent with less than 10 and greater than 15 percent representing underuse and overuse of maternal and child health care services, respectively.\n\nThe experts say while a caesarean section can be life-saving, it can also be medically unnecessary.\n\nAkinola said while the rate of CS is low in Nigeria, it is becoming an epidemic in some countries.\n\n\u201cWhat we have in Nigeria in most cases is facility-based, so each hospital can only talk about what is happening in their hospital, not what is happening in the society. Overall, our CS rate is probably about 6 percent, if not lesser,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding, Akinola said if CS use is less than than 15 percent, it might be that it is not being offered enough when necessary. \u201cSo that is why we still have obstructed labour and prolonged labour in patients who ought to have caesarean section.\u201d\n\nHe noted that some patients prefer CS to vaginal birth because of the pains associated with vaginal delivery.\n\n\u201cSometimes, a patient wants to have c-section done because she doesn\u2019t want to take the risk with normal labour. CS is straightforward, you know the time you want to go in and you know the time you are coming out.\n\n\u201cSometimes, litigation alone is a factor, such that you want everything to go well; you don\u2019t want to take the risk of long labour. So, it\u2019s enough reason to go for CS, just to be on the safe side.\n\n\u201cAnd the higher the rate of litigation, the higher the CS rate. Labour is not easy; labour is difficult, so it comes with difficulty sometimes.So you don\u2019t want to take such risk,\u201d Akinola said.\n\nThe gynaecologist, however, disclosed that countries with high cases of caesarean section are narrowing the indications of CS.\n\n\u201cThis means that you must have tried for so long and fulfilled the indications for CS before it is done and you are sure that that is the best option.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Akinola\u2019s statement, the Chairman, Lagos State chapter of SOGON, Dr.Akinde said the rate of CS is alarming globally.\n\n\u201cThere has been an increasing trend in the rate of CS. The rate is so alarming now that people are beginning to question the rationale behind it.\n\n\u201cPeople are becoming litigation-conscious and if a woman loses the baby in the course of delivery, she can go to court and medical practitioners are scared of facing litigation. So, they want to have a live mother and a live baby, than having to tell stories.\n\n\u201cWe also have a number of women coming up to say they don\u2019t want to go through pain or the hassles of vaginal delivery and they just want to have CS.\n\n\u201cCS can be done under anaesthesia, whereby the woman is awake and within one hour, everything is finished. Unlike when a woman wants to go through natural labour and the minimum hours the woman will suffer the pain is 12 hours.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s because of patients\u2019 demand and practitioners are becoming more conscious of litigation.\n\n\u201cMedical practitioners are making conscious efforts and making reviews to keep the caesarean section rate to the barest minimum,\u201d he said.\n\nAkinde noted that the rate of CS is as high as 50 percent in some countries but people are making conscious efforts to make sure that the rate does not go above WHO recommendation.\n\n\u201cMedical practitioners, obstetricians in particular, are making conscious efforts to review their practice and want to make sure that the CS is justified for any patient.\n\n\u201cFrom time to time, practitioners review their practice and make sure that it is in uniformity with the best practice in the world to ensure that the CS is justified.\n\n\u201cParticularly when you practise in an organised sector, where your actions are likely to be questioned, you may be asked why you have to do a CS.\n\n\u201cSo the practice of obstetrics have got to the level where you don\u2019t just do a CS just for the sake of doing it but it has to be justified. So, you don\u2019t just cut every woman just because you know how to cut,\u201d Akinde said.\n\nRather than recommending specific target rates, WHO underscores the importance of focusing on each woman\u2019s unique needs in pregnancy and childbirth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for all women to be able to talk to healthcare providers and be part of the decision making on their birth, receiving adequate information, including the risks and benefits. Emotional support is a critical aspect of quality care throughout pregnancy and childbirth,\u201d said the Medical Officer at WHO and HRP, Dr. Ana PilarBetran,\n\nWHO recommends some non-clinical actions that can reduce medically unnecessary use of CS, within the overall context of high quality and respectful care.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nNon-teaching staff of public universities may be heading for another showdown with the Federal Government over plans by the latter to remove staff school workers from the 2022 budget.\n\nThe workers, under the umbrella of Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), threatened to ground public universities if the controversial circular directing that workers of the Staff Schools should not be captured in the 2022 budget is not withdrawn.\n\nSSANU also warned that reopening a matter that had been decided by the National Industrial Court would affect the industrial harmony being enjoyed in the universities, alleging that if the government should go ahead to implement the directive, over 3,000 of its members would be affected.\n\nHowever, Labour and Employment Minister, Chris Ngige has assured the workers the government will address the issue to avert another industrial action in the universities.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in Abuja at the weekend on the looming crisis in the universities, President of SSANU, Comrade Mohammed Ibrahim, accused the government of going contrary to the agreement with the union even when the court had given a judgment on the matter.\n\nIbrahim, who was reacting to the alleged circular from the Budget Office directing that teachers in Staff Schools should be removed from the Consolidated Salary Scale, (CONTISS), in the 2022 budget even when there is a subsisting court judgment in favour of the union, said SSANU would \u201cfight\u201d the development to finish.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, the issue is that we are also taken aback by the recent negative development that we just saw last week that the federal government through the budget office directed that universities should expunge or remove the list of our members who teach in the university demonstration schools, meaning that they shouldn\u2019t be captured in the CONTISS salary table.\n\n\u201cBut the government is planning to put them in a different salary table called CONPISS, the consolidated public service salary scale.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNow, this is a negation of our agreement with government, because those members of ours who are in the university demonstration schools are bonafide members of University staff, and they have their employment letters signed by the registrar\u2019s of various universities, as approved by councils under the terms and conditions for engagement is that they will operate and be paid based on the consolidated salary scale, that is paid to all university staff.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this development shows that government is trying to create another friction between us and them. Because the attempt was made five or six years ago, when government decided to remove them completely from the employment and we went to court, as you\u2019re aware, went to industrial court.\n\n\u201cAfter a long battle, we got a judgment in our favour. And it was interpreted that members of staff in the universities who teach in the university staff, schools or demonstration schools are bonafide members of staff of universities, as employed by councils, therefore, they should be treated as such, those that were sacked, should be returned, and that their salaries should be restored.\n\n\u201cAnd that we were happy we celebrated this, government complied to an extent, even though there are still some universities that have returned them, but have refused to pay them backlog of their salaries that they missed.\n\n\u201cSo, all of a sudden, this is the recent development like I call it negative development that has erupted and our members cannot sit down and watch or the union cannot sit and watch its members being maltreated.\n\n\u201cThere is a contract agreement with government, these people have been employed. Our expectation is that we should allow that to continue until when they retire. If government is planning to stop funding, personnel costs of teachers in the university demonstration schools, it should be from the new employments they are making, but not the ones that they have already employed and they have signed contract with.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow this we will fight again with all the vigour and we will follow all the legal ways of making sure that we defend the interests of our membership, like we did in the first instance.\u201d",

When that is done, prosperity will abound.\n\n\u201cFor chief executives of companies, they should act as fathers in their various establishments. The head of vulcanisers should act as a father, the head of tomato sellers should act as a father to them and the head.\n\n\u201cWhen we do that and stop playing negatively at home and in our workplaces, definitely Nigeria will be a better place. We should amplify the things that unite us and make positive statements at all times.\n\n\u201cAs a father of the nation, as a father of the state, as a father of a company, if we refuse to make statements when we need to make statements, if refuse to take actions when we need to take actions, just know that you are running the country or the organisaton, as the case may be, to a state of instability.\n\n\u201cFor all of us as fathers at home, we should play our roles just like Joseph did to protect Mary and little Jesus when he was born.\u201d",

          "title": "Stop profiling Nigerian youths as criminals and cultists, Ita Enang warns leaders",
          "text": "From Joe Effiong, Uyo\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Ita Enang, has warned leaders to stop profiling Nigerian youths \u2018as criminals or cultists\u2019 and other such \u2018demeaning appellations\u2019.\n\nAccording to the presidential aide, such negative labels and the reluctance of the older generation to create space for the young people in governance and the economy have lowered their self-esteem and are largely responsible for the youth restiveness witnessed in the country.\n\nSpeaking at the weekend in Uyo at the National Dialogue to mark 2021 Democracy Day organised by the Civil Liberties Organisations (CLO) in conjunction with the Office of Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Enang blamed the government for using and abandoning the youths without providing them with jobs.\n\nHe urged the government to apologise to the youths, saying \u2018it is time to have meaningful dialogue with the youths of this state and country and practically give them roles and space in the Governance and economy of this state and country.\n\n\u2018We should not profile them as criminals or cultists nor such derogatory nor demeaning appellations that give them low self or societal esteem.\n\n\u2018Doing so ostracises them and embolden them to form camps, carry arms and do the worst. This please is in view of the peculiar times, and not the norm for all times. We should not profile nor stigmatise them,\u2019 he noted.\n\nThe presidential aide, who also called for a national dialogue every five years to tackle the challenges the country faces, said the dialogue would help the six geo-political zones in the country express their grievances and reach a compromise that would help to move the nation forward.\n\nEmphasising that the voices of discord and discontent across the country are getting louder and need to be addressed, Enang said the national conference would not take over the functions of the government but serve as feedback from the people.\n\nAlso speaking, a federal legislator representing Etinan, Nsit Ibom and Nsit Ubium federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Onofiok Luke, cautioned President Buhari against ignoring the various agitations coming out from the South East and South West regions.\n\nLuke, who is the Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, expressed disappointment that much has been said but nobody is listening to the various voices of reason in the country.\n\n\u2018It is by coming together to share ideas and share thoughts beyond party lines, taking a bipartisan approach, bringing together men and women who have leaders touch, one solution or the other, one idea or the other that we could all fine-tune and push the agenda for the development of this country.\n\n\u2018I have always been an advocate for a bipartisan approach to the problems of this country. The problem we are facing doesn\u2019t know party, it doesn\u2019t know region, religion.\n\n\u2018Now the security crisis we are experiencing in the South East, we have had a case of that crisis in North West. We have had students kidnapped from Schools, and those students are not Christians, those students are Muslims.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had this crisis happen in states that are not APC, we have had it happen in states that are PDP. And the people affected by this crisis are the Nigerian populace. It affects our parents, siblings.\n\n\u2018I am a firm believer in the unity of Nigeria, the unity of Nigeria founded on justice, equity and then founded on true federalism. And we can achieve this by every segment of this society seeing ourselves as equals.\n\n\u2018The agitation that we have had, agitation for secession, for all sorts of things is because some sections of the country feel marginalised.\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the dialogue \u2013 \u201cDemocracy, Insecurity and Unity of Nigeria\u201d \u2013 the National Legal Adviser of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Barr Emmanuel Enoidem, who was represented on the occasion by Dr Tom Fredfish, made a case for an Igbo president, maintaining that the civil war was yet to be over until the Igbos are given the chance to produce the president of Nigeria.\n\nState Chairman of the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) Akwa Ibom State Branch, Mr Franklyn Isong, who set the tone for the dialogue said the essence of drawing participants across political, religious and ethnic lines was to demonstrate the need for a bipartisan approach to tackling Nigeria\u2019s common enemies, economic challenges and insecurity.",

She can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional.\n\nIn this interview, she narrated her journey into the movie industry, her heartbreak experience and greatest fear. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us about yourself and how you came into acting?\n\nI am Titilayomi Adeoye. I hail from the city of Ibadan. I studied Mass Communication at the Polytechnic, Ibadan and after my Industrial Training at Ogun State Television (OGTV); I proceeded for my HND also in Mass Communication. For me, acting is a natural talent from God, it is my second nature and I can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional. I joined Mr. Latin Theater Group in 2007. Mr. Latin gave me the opportunity to act as an agent in the movie titled, Baba Eleran in London. It was a big deal for me at that time.\n\nHow many movies have you featured in till date?\n\nSincerely, I have lost count.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest challenge in the movie industry?\n\nFor me, the only challenge is lack of opportunities to prove my abilities. But as I persevered and turned up at locations on time, each role assigned to me was done perfectly; confidence in me built up and that is how I get other opportunities to showcase my God-given talent.\n\nHave you produced any movie of your own?\n\nYes. I have produced over 10 home movies both in English and Yoruba. I am the producer of Pero, Scuffle, So Far So Close, Okanran, Tewe Tegbo, Eje, Ahon Mi, Omo Mala, Mojere, Ojo Ife Bere and many more.\n\nWhat part of your body do you consider your selling point?\n\nMy pointed nose and boobs.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s because I get compliments a lot about them from people.\n\nWhat has fame stolen from you?\n\nI am still myself. I promised myself not to let anything take who I am away from me.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about Titilayomi?\n\nComing out of my shell gradually to do something different.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do for a living?\n\nAside acting, I\u2019m also a realtor. I sell properties\u2026.\n\nAre you in any relationship at the moment?\n\nI would rather not say anything about that. I want to keep my private life private.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest fear in life? My greatest fear is failure. So many people look up to me that I can\u2019t afford to let them down.\n\nDo you believe in scandal for fame?\n\nNo. I guide against scandal in all parts. I don\u2019t need to be involved in scandal before I become popular. I love to keep my nose clean always.\n\nWhat\u2019s the highest thing you\u2019ve ever done for your man?\n\nI got him a job, fed him and even clothed him, but the relationship didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t ignore the signs.\n\nWhat is your turn off in a man?\n\nLies and deceits. I can\u2019t stand a man who lies.\n\nCan you have sex on a first date?\n\nNo! Sex is a bond. I need to be connected to you before I can have sex with you.\n\nCan you recount the happiest day of your life?\n\nAnytime I witness the breaking of a new day is my happiest. I don\u203at joke with that great opportunity at all.",

          "title": "Dot-in-circle: Amechi lambasts Buhari",
          "text": "From David Onwuchekwa\n\nFirst Aviation Minister in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amechi has tackled President Muhammadu Buhari for describing Ndigbo as a dot-in-a- circle, condemning the wrong choice of words and lack of diplomacy on the part of Mr President.\n\nHe also talked about agitation for self-determination and revealed what he would have done, if he were in President Buhari\u2019s shoes. Chief Amechi who has just clocked 92 years looked at other national issues. Excerpt:\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently called the Igbo a dot in circle. What is your reaction to that?\n\nBuhari\u2019s deep-rooted hatred for Ndigbo is not a new thing. Buhari\u2019s lack of diplomacy even in government and use of diplomatic language or the language that fits a president is well known in Nigeria because as at today, even though Buhari is not wearing a military uniform, he is still the same soldier who overthrew a Fulani-led government in 1983 because the constitution of the then National Party of Nigeria (NPN) said that the next president of the country will be an Igbo man and Buhari swore that an Igbo will never be a president of the country. So, his hatred for Ndigbo and everything Igbo is not a new thing to me. And then his poor choice of language as a president, a real president would have found better words to use than that expression that Ndigbo are a dot in a circle. That is a poor choice of words, very unpresidential. That is all I can say about it. Now, yes, he said that the Southeast, that Igbo do not have access to the sea. There are many countries of the world that have no access to the sea yet they function. I have said it personally that I believe in a bigger country, Nigeria that I fought for. I dedicated my entire youth to the struggle for independence of Nigeria, a big country. And up till today I don\u2019t believe that Nigeria should break. But if Nigeria breaks, Buhari is responsible for the breaking of the country. If this country disintegrates, Buhari should accept total responsibility for it because it is his actions and inactions that have brought the whole thing in Nigeria to the level we are now.\n\nWhat is your opinion about the President\u2019s plan to return grazing routes and open grazing even when the Southern governors have banned it?\n\nThis question of Fulanis and cattle herders and all that is a new language and it only came up in Buhari\u2019s regime. There have been governments in Nigeria. There were NCNC and AG in Nigeria as political parties. There have been military regimes in Nigeria. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle to the East, West and South to sell. Buhari is the only president who wants to equate Fulani economy and empire with his attempt to Fulanize Nigeria and to Islamize Nigeria. That is what is causing the whole trouble. That is for allowing the Fulanis to be armed and allowing his government, people inside his government to arm the herders and they come down here, they shoot people, they damage crops, they rape women, kidnap people and not one of them has been arraigned in any court of law even though those who are arrested and handed over to the police are released the following day. What kind of president is that? The younger elements who are agitating for separation, agitating for Biafra or even the Yoruba now apart from the South-south which is another question which will be dealt with later. Will the South-south talk, are they free to talk?\n\nLet\u2019s leave that. Those who are free to talk are talking. Now, the younger elements say instead of being slaves to Fulanis after coming out from British imperialism to Fulani Empire, the Igbo say we don\u2019t support that. My own case is that the younger elements who did not see how we ran the country before they were born, how there was equity and balance in the country grew up to see themselves marginalized in their own country, rendered poor in the midst of plenty in their own country, and they said no, the system has to be changed because we have never been slaves in our lifetime. Our history shows we have never been slaves, let us go. A human president, a president with human feelings would not have stopped them of that. All he has to do is to conduct a plebiscite and ask Igbo to come and vote whether really they should go based on what these younger elements are saying or remain. How is he (Buhari) sure, in any case that if a plebiscite is called the majority will say we will go. Igbo have so many investments in other parts of Nigeria and West Africa. Igbo abroad are more in population and richer than Igbo at home. And so, they would certainly want that spread to be. The only thing they want is freedom, give us equity and balance that is all they are asking for in the affairs of the country. Let us compete with others, but you cannot come and take our general wealth and deny us our fair share. That is what they are saying. So, the proper thing would have been let\u2019s go and do the plebiscites, if the majority says we will go, let them go in peace. If the majority says we will not go, no we are not going, then they will remain and negotiate and find out what is their anger, what is the problem and all that and then solve them. That is the way I should have handled it, if I were in the position of the president. If the man is the kind of man who would listen to advice, that is what I would have advised him to do. He doesn\u2019t take good advice and always being misled by the cabals around him. He is not free again. Have you seen a president who has never made a speech himself except occasionally when he reads what is written for him by his speech writers and they pass it on to him, which he revises a number of times and then come to read it. After reading it, have you ever seen him take any question from the press? You are a pressman find out.\n\nLet\u2019s return to grazing routes and open grazing.\n\nDespite the ban placed by the Southern Governors, Mr President insists that the ban will not hold.\n\nWhat is your take on that?\n\nThe president has no such power even under the military constitution we are operating in Nigeria. He has no power to decide on land matters in the states. The states have the powers to decide on what to do with land in the individual states not the Federal Government. He cannot implement it, he cannot exercise it, although as a dictator, he can send soldiers to go and show force and all that. But the question is, it is all the same illegality that is going on otherwise he has no powers at all to do that. The presidency has nothing to say about this is a grazing ground, this is not a grazing ground, no. Only states governments have that right.\n\nWhat was the relationship like with nomadic Fulani herders in your days and at what point did we get it wrong?\n\nIn my days, I belonged to a political party that did not discriminate. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle. Those who lived permanently bought the cattle and the cattle were escorted on the roads. There were no so many trailers in our days. They were taking them along the road, but they were not allowed into farms. There was discipline then. Allowing them into farms is to provoke crisis to kill the people and that is what they are doing now. And that is what they continue to do. So, in our own time they mixed up well with our people. There was peace and harmony. One of the Fulanis, Alhaji Umaro was elected a member of Eastern House of Chiefs. Another young Fulani man was made the Mayor of Enugu, a Fulani man from Sokoto. He was elected two terms as a Mayor of Enugu because he was a President of Enugu youth branch of NCNC which I was serving as Secretary General. So, they were just part of us. They had absolute freedom and we were all living in peace and harmony. Nobody disturbed them. They were not particularly educated, but if we found any of them showing interest in education, we encouraged them to embrace education. The point we got it wrong is at the point of Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria. That was when the whole thing started. It didn\u2019t start in Shagari\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time. It started with President Buhari because of his other ambition of colonizing Nigeria, that Nigeria is a property bequeathed to them by Uthman Dan Fodio. That is the point we got it wrong.\n\nAnambra governorship election will come up on November 6 as scheduled by the INEC. What are your expectations, advice to political parties and Anambra people?\n\nThe individual political parties are doing their game. Some of the aspirants have come to me to inform me they are interested in the election. They asked for my prayer and I prayed that God may make the best among them to lead Anambra for the next four or eight years. It won\u2019t be said that the present government we have is any of the best. That thing there is a one-man show. So, he is going out next year, let him go out. Whosoever wins, let him know that Anambra State has wise men. Anambra has great names and great men in Nigeria. Let him realize that Anambra is full of hard-working men and women. And let him know that Anambra State is a state where people know their rights and are not prepared to shy away from them and then they should stop stealing from government. My doubt about free and fair election is on the interference of Abuja, otherwise if it is a question of voting I have no doubt that there will be free voting. But then manipulating the result is what I don\u2019t know because the constitution is such now that the military in their desire to promote military government in Nigeria concentrated all powers in Abuja. So, Abuja can still interfere, but I do hope they will not. I have not heard that the IPOB said there will be no election. If the election is going to be disturbed it will come from the Federal Government in order to create the atmosphere for a state of emergency in Anambra State. The Federal Government through their secret service, through their Gestapo could or may do it in such a way that it will be said based on this we can declare state of emergency and so forth. So, voters and politicians should be weary of that. They should not give them the chance. I advise Anambra people to do a peaceful election.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nHussaini Salisu is a Fulani rice farmer as well as a herder. He holds the traditional title of Dallatun Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nSalisu is currently the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Livestock Breeders Association of Nigeria (LIBAN), Kaduna State chapter.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he said that Nigerian politicians should stop saying that foreign Fulani are behind kidnapping and banditry in the country, warning that such remarks may provoke Fulani in neighbouring countries to launch attacks on Nigeria.\n\nSalisu also spoke on other national issues. Excerpts:\n\nBy way of introduction, are you a herdsman?\n\nI am the Dallatun of Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. I am a rice farmer. My parents live in the bush. We farm and rear cattle. We have farmers and cattle rearers whose occupations are being threatened by insecurity, particularly kidnapping and banditry. And the only way out of this insecurity is for the government to be realistic and non-partial in ensuring that peace is restored. Fulani people have been threatened by insecurity and their cows rustled over the years. Now, the government is trying to protect the farmers so that they can work on their farms without fear of being kidnapped. But nobody is talking about protecting the Fulani herdsmen who are rearing cows. They need to be protected too. We Fulani have been cheated, myself in particular, all my cows have been rustled, and I cannot also go to the farm. And somebody will say there will be peace?. I know many people will say Fulani are the bandits, kidnappers, this is how they have been frustrated. If you continue to talk about Fulani this way, they will not have peace and if they don\u2019t have peace, you cannot have peace yourself.\n\nWhat is the implication of farmers not going to the farms because of insecurity?\n\nFood scarcity will continue because the government says it will not import food, and now insecurity does not allow farmers to go to the farms to work. And the little farm products are being bought off by urban traders who travel to the village in search of food. So, urban dwellers rely on rural communities for food. The rural farmers and herders were living peacefully before now until city dwellers brought calamity to them by way of divide and rule in order to buy off their goods at cheaper rates. My parents were the pioneer owners of grazing reserves in Kachia, Kaduna State. My parents sponsored me to school from proceeds realised from the sales of thier cattle. Up till today my parents are in the bush rearing their cattle. But their 5,000 cattle have been reduced to 1,000 now as a result of rustling by criminal elements.\n\nWhat exactly are the causes of farmers/herders clashes in Nigeria?\n\nWhat used to cause farmers/herders clash was due to laying of claims to ownership of land because after the herders have penetrated thick forests and cleared the ways, the farmers would turn round to claim the areas. So, it resulted to clashes between them. But nowadays, there is no farmers/herders clashes. What we have now is communal clashes going on everywhere. Unfortunately, Fulani are the most hated people in Nigeria despite thier desires to live in peace with everybody. You cannot hate Fulani because we are hardworking people. We provide milk for the country, we provide meat for the country, and even the shoes you are wearing are made of cow\u2019s skins. Yet we are being frustrated.\n\nSome of our political leaders said most of the kidnappers and bandits are foreign Fulani. Do you agree?\n\nThose causing kidnapping and banditry are not foreign Fulani. If you say they are foreign Fulani, you are implicating Nigeria because Niger Republic or Burkina Faso and any other neighbouring countries will say you are accusing them unnecessarily. They will hate Nigeria, and you are implicating the country. The Fulani in Nigeria are the most populous in Northern Nigeria. So, if you say there are foreign Fulani in Nigeria, how do you confirm they are foreigners. It is very easy and simple to identify a Fulani man. But to us, any Fulani man you see with cattle, he is of benefit to Nigeria, he is not a foreigner. If we continue to call them foreigners, we are telling the rest of the world that they are criminals. We are implicating Nigeria. This is very unfortunate. Well, if you insist that they are foreigners, you have to identify them. After all Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa are foreigners, everybody comes from somewhere. The world started from somewhere. But if you keep on saying they are foreigners, you are encouraging them to come to Nigeria to join in the fight. When you keep on blackmailing them as foreigners they will come to Nigeria to help Fulani in Nigeria to fight.\n\nHow can kidnapping and banditry be brought to an end?\n\nThose who are into kidnapping are angry and they want to brutalise you because you have taken their products; they have nothing to rear, they have been frustrated, and they are taken to prisons because people believed that they are the bandits. Kidnapping and banditry are being tended towards the Fulani man. I can be innocently picked as bandit and be sent to prison because I am Fulani. Whatever is bad you label it against Fulani man. Fulani people have never committed crime, but you are now forcing them to commit crimes because their means of livelihood have been stolen. Their cows are being rustled. Their houses burnt, our people are killed.\n\nWhat happened to nomadic education put in place for the Fulani herders by previous government?\n\nNobody supported nomadic education to stand the test of time since it was established 35 years ago. Government and the general public did not support nomadic education. It is still at the primary level. It is not supposed to be at the infancy level after 35 years of its foundation. It should be well funded for the betterment of the society. If you are educated you cannot be engaging in criminal activities. The Fulani participated in the nomadic education, but the government did not motivate the school. Most of the classes were under the trees. How can you study under trees in this modern age of Nigeria\u2019s history. They are supposed to build functional schools for them.\n\nDon\u2019t you think dialogue is the way out of the present situation of insecurity between government and bandits?\n\nIs government ready to dialogue with anybody. The government is fighting those who are aggrieved. The government should bring them closer and negotiate with them. Look at what Sheik Ahmed Gumi did, he went to bandits\u2019 enclave, even while all of them were holding gun, trying to negotiate with them. This means that they can be negotiated with. You cannot go closer to any other tribe with gun, but you can go closer to a Fulani man with a gun and tell him to drop the gun, and he will drop it. Yet nobody did that with them. You want to have peace with this people and yet you refused to support Sheik Gumi who told Nigerians that these bandits are ready to make peace, but nobody supported Gumi. How can peace reign when you don\u2019t support somebody who is making the move.\n\nAre you saying that this government does not believe in negotiations with bandits?\n\nAsk yourself, you are a journalists, have you heard where the government is negotiating with them? There is nowhere that negotiation is going on. We have many political associations among the Fulani, nobody is negotiating with them. People who are making room for negotiation are being criticised, they are being called criminals too.\n\nFederal Government has recently resolved to reopen grazing routes across the country. What is your reaction to this?\n\nThat is what President Buhari said, not the government. And what did the southern governors say, they said no to open grazing. Every other Nigerians said no. And they want to have peace. You cannot have peace when you don\u2019t want me to survive. The government should be allowed to create grazing reserves. But animals need to move about because they are not like pigs or goats that you can tie them in one place. You cannot keep 1,000 cows in one place. They cannot survive without moving about. The government is not helping the Fulani if it keeps the cows in one place.\n\nThe argument here is that the era of cows moving about is gone in this modern age and time. Don\u2019t you think so?\n\nThe whole system of Nigeria is not operated in a modern way. When the president wants to make speech he uses microphone; who created the microphone, it is the European. All the technology is from the European people, and yet you said you want to modernise grazing, what are you modernising. Then go ahead and modernise the economy so that everybody becomes rich. If you create grazing reserves for the Fulani, you can then arrest them if they go out of their ways to destroy anything. Take a look at the Kachia grazing reserves, we are living peacefully with the communities and our neighbours, there is no fight between us. They are on their own, we are on our own.\n\nFor some Nigerians who were born and grown in rural communities, they often tell peaceful and cordial relationship with nomadic Fulani. But all of a sudden there was mistrust and suspension between the Fulani and the people in the host communities. What went wrong?\n\nIt is the urban people that brought this disaffection to the Fulani and the local people in the rural communities. The urban people brought calamity to them. They have made them to fight one another.\n\nHow?\n\nLook at the farming system in the country, the farming system is collapsing, rearing is collapsing and the urban people want to survive from the farm produce of the rural dwellers. Now, the local people cannot farm again because of the calamity from the city. For instance, there is a town called Zangon-Kataf in southern Kaduna when the Fulani have been living with the natives for over 300 years until Hausa people from urban areas caused fight for them.\n\nHow did the urban Hausa caused the fight?\n\nThe Hausa urban are traders, they are not farmers. So they manipulate the native farmers, bought off their farm produce at a cheaper price. So also they manipulated the Fulani herders, picked up cows, the meat at cheaper rate. And before you know what was happening, crisis stepped in between the native and the Fulani.\n\nDo you see an end to this crisis?\n\nFrom the beginning of the world crisis was in place. It can never stop, but it can be minimised. However, bombs are being thrown at our cattle.\n\nIn the Southeast, some groups of Igbo are agitating for Biafra republic, and in the Southwest, similar groups are asking for Oduduwa republic. What is your reaction?\n\nWhen such republics are created there will never be peace in Nigeria because we will continue to fight with our former brothers. We will not want to see one another because we were once together as brothers and now you don\u2019t want to see me. They will even fight each other over land because there will not be enough land for them. And whenever they want to travel to any part of the world they must pass through Nigeria. But if they want to separate, let them go. We the Fulani people will survive if the country breaks up because we are the most populous in the North. We are the pioneer rulers of northern Nigeria. All the northern rulers are Fulani from inception.\n\nWhy are you addressed as Hausa/Fulani?\n\nWell, if they want to benefit from us, they address us Hausa/Fulani. We are Fulani, so you cannot call us Igbo/Fulani. If Hausa want to benefit from us they hide under our name. If it is a wrong thing, they say they are Hausa. If it is a right thing, they will say they are part of the Fulani. Once you are a Muslim from Niger Republic and enter Nigeria you become an Hausa man. Even as a Nigerian once you are a Muslim people tend to call you Hausa.",
          "summary": "I know many people will say Fulani are the bandits, kidnappers, this is how they have been frustrated.\nIf you continue to talk about Fulani this way, they will not have peace and if they don\u2019t have peace, you cannot have peace yourself.\nWhen you keep on blackmailing them as foreigners they will come to Nigeria to help Fulani in Nigeria to fight.\nHow did the urban Hausa caused the fight?\nWhen such republics are created there will never be peace in Nigeria because we will continue to fight with our former brothers.",

          "title": "Bawa: EFCC Won\u2019t Hand over Cases of Interest to any State",
          "text": "\u2022Says commission as a creation of N\u2019Assembly supersedes states\u2019 establishments\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nChairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declared that the commission, under his leadership, would not hand over cases of interest to any state government. Bawa spoke against the backdrop of the setting up of anti-corruption agencies by some states.\n\nLagos, Kano, and Bayelsa states have, recently, set up anti-graft agencies. Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reaffirm commitment to one Nigeria\n\nChristopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nLeaders from the South-east zone, yesterday, announced the setting up of different committees to engage agitating youths in the area as part of new initiatives for a lasting peace. This followed a meeting in Enugu State.\n\nThe leaders, who met for the second time in two weeks, reaffirmed their commitment to a united Nigeria, and rejected the agitation by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for a Republic of Biafra.\n\nAccording to a communiqu\u00e9 read by the chairman of South-east Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, the South-east leaders said in order not to manage the situation in the zone, they \u201chave set up a committee to engage such youths to stop and allow elders speak to address such fears\u201d.\n\nRegarding the safety of the Igbo in other parts of the country, and the newly established regional security outfit, the communiqu\u00e9 said the \u201cmeeting directed our governors and Ohaneze Ndigbo to liaise with indigenes from the northern part of Nigeria and indigenes of other regions to assure the nation, Nigeria, and their people of their safety in South-east.\u201d\n\nThe committees set up, according to the communiqu\u00e9, were those on \u201cagitation; engagement with other regions; those of our people in the North, South-east, South-south and South-west; IPOB, MASSOB, youths and market people, Okada and Keke; diaspora; advocacy; and diplomatic engagement with foreign missions.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was a follow-up to the one the leaders held with the presidential delegation, led by the Minister of Defence, Maj.Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), on June 11, in the wake of the rising insecurity in the region.\n\nUmahi, who read from the communiqu\u00e9 said, the leaders had reaffirmed their commitment to one nation built on fairness, love and respect for one another. He added that the committees were to help articulate the demands of the region, particularly as it relates to insecurity, and meet with the federal government.\n\nThe governor regretted that although leaders in the South-east had reassured people from other regions of their safety, Ndigbo were still being threatened, especially, in the north.\n\n\u201cWe call on leaders in other regions to take note of the threats and take proper action,\u201d he said, adding that the leaders condemned the killing of security operatives and destruction of security facilities in the zone.\n\nHe maintained that the impression that leaders in the zone were silent over the rising wave of agitation was, wrong as they had come out publicly to speak against the agitations.\n\nUmahi said, \u201cWe have again endorsed Ebubeagu and asked them to work with security agencies to ensure the protection of lives and property of the people in the South-east.\u201d\n\nHe called on security operatives working in the region to operate within the confines of the law.\n\nThose present at the meeting included the host, Governor of Enugu State, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi; Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu; Deputy Governors of Anambra and Imo states, Dr. Nkem Okeke and Prof. Placid Njoku, respectively; Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige; and Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Hon. Uchechukwu Ogah.\n\nOthers were President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Ambassador George Obiozor; former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim; former Governor of old Enugu State, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo; former Governor of Ebonyi State, Senator Sam Egwu; former Governor of Imo State, Chief Ikedi Ohakim; and former Military Administrator of old Anambra State, Rear Admiral Allison Madueke.\n\nIn attendance also were Speaker of Enugu State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Edward Ubosi; Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Deputy Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Toby Okechukwu; Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyawu; Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga; Archbishop of Enugu Ecclesiastical Province, Most. Rev. Dr. Emmanuel O. Chukwuma; Chairman, Enugu State Traditional Rulers\u2019 Council, HRH Igwe Lawrence Agubuzu; immediate past President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo; and Professor Chinedu Nebo, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But with borrowing they have created super economies, built massive train terminals, massive airports, schools and hospitals.\n\n\u201cAnd you know what is happening, we go to use them and they charge us, so who is paying?\n\n\u201cI have heard people say they are mortgaging the future of people, as we are holding this meeting, one new baby has arrived, if you don\u2019t prepare for him you make that future bleak.\n\n\u201cAs at the time we were building Lekki Bridge in Lagos, it was N29 billion, the child that was born then in 2010 is going to be 11 this year.\n\n\u201cIf his mother carrying his pregnancy had crossed that bridge at any time, he used that bridge before he was born and we had secured that asset for him before he arrived.\n\n\u201cIf we wait until he is about 30 to build that bridge, we can\u2019t buy it at N29 billion anymore.\n\n\u201cSo, if he contributes to paying it so be it because he started using it before he even arrived.\n\n\u201cSo, those who said don\u2019t borrow have changed their minds, they have set parameters of debt to GDP and within those parameters you play very well.\n\n\u201cAnd those who say so now, where were they in 2005 or 2006 when the government paid out $12 billion in cash to go and buy a tent when the house is flooding, who does that?\n\n\u201cThey took $12 billion in cash to go and write off debts that had been classified.\n\n\u201cThe roads were bad then, the rail was not built, airports needed expansion, Lagos-Ibadan (Expressway) needed to be built.\n\n\u201cBut since the aftermath of going to write off that debt we started borrowing again, so this administration did inherit all the debt.\n\n\u201cThere is a sector of our economy called the financial services sector, if all of us put money in a bank and nobody is borrowing, that bank is going to fold up.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have anybody in any venture capital, finance house, mortgage bank, it is because the government is borrowing that they can pay their salary.\n\n\u201cBorrowing is not a sin, it is part of the essence of keeping the economy growing and the armchair economists talking about public expenditure for example who have never run a government must be careful what they feed to the public,\u201d Fashola added.",

It will help if such is discovered because it will be circumstantial evidence to make you say that this body belongs to this person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to avoid sensationalism. If you look at a page in the report I submitted, all I did was to summarise. However, if I do an autopsy and I do not do radiography, you would tear me to pieces if I come to court with such a record. That is why I had to do everything, leaving nothing to chance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoris Okuwobi, chair of the panel, ruled that the records presented be accepted as evidence and adjourned further hearing till June 26.",

          "text": "John Obafunwa, chief pathologist at the Lagos state University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), has submitted autopsy reports of 99 persons killed during the #EndSARS protests in Lagos to the state judicial panel of inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2020, Nigerians across the country took to the streets to demonstrate against police brutality under the #EndSARS campaign.\n\nOn October 20, soldiers invaded the Lekki tollgate, where some demonstrators had gathered, and fired shots.\n\nThere has been a controversy around the casualty figures since the incident occurred.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking at the hearing of the judicial panel on June 6, Obafunwa said 99 bodies were received for autopsy between October 20 and 24.\n\nHe said out of the 99 bodies received, three were brought in from Lekki and the remaining bodies were received from other parts of the state including Surulere, Ikorodu, Ajah, Fagba, among others.\n\nObafunwa had then been asked to submit the reports to the panel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the PUNCH, giving evidence at the panel on Saturday, Obafunwa said the 99 bodies, which include three killed at the Lekki tollgate, were deposited at the mortuary between October 19 and October 24, 2020.\n\nHe said the ethical practice, especially during a mass disaster or a situation where all sorts of speculations arise, is to carry out an x-ray before you put a knife to a body.\n\n\u201cYou need to look for hidden fractures or prosthesis. It will help if such is discovered because it will be circumstantial evidence to make you say that this body belongs to this person,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to avoid sensationalism. If you look at a page in the report I submitted, all I did was to summarise. However, if I do an autopsy and I do not do radiography, you would tear me to pieces if I come to court with such a record. That is why I had to do everything, leaving nothing to chance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoris Okuwobi, chair of the panel, ruled that the records presented be accepted as evidence and adjourned further hearing till June 26.",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed. This is social media censorship brought back through the back door.\n\n\n\nLend your voice. Say no.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "How tech tools create a safe space for sexual violence survivors in Nigeria",
          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "text": "Looking at where Nigeria is today, in terms of worsening insecurity, poverty, economic malaise, among other ills, many Nigerians are wondering what the state of the nation will look like in the next two years when the current administration is expected to come to an end.\n\nSome have described the next two years as an \u201ceternity\u201d, saying that to endure the \u201csuffocating air\u201d for the next two years would be the worst punishment for Nigerians.\n\nDuring the 2015 general election campaign, the then ruling party and the main opposition party promised Nigerians a lot of goodies.\n\nThe campaign afforded the then opposition the platform to blame the insecurity, economic woes, and every other problem in Nigeria on the failure of the then ruling party.\n\nBut as much as Nigerians quickly concluded that the messiah has come, they seemed to have never enjoyed any relief since the then opposition party came to power.\n\nFor many, the situation has degenerated from bad to worse in all fronts; from economy, social life, healthcare, and especially tackling insecurity, which many considered as reason the opposition won in 2015.\n\nInflation, unemployment rate, death rate, debt profile among other negative trends have more than quadrupled in the last six years of this administration and the remaining two years may likely make no difference.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer Boko Haram and North East. Now bandits, kidnapers, and herdsmen have taken the war to all parts of the country. There are killings every day and the government, which promised to tackle insecurity keeps doing little or nothing to tackle it,\u201d Yohanna Bulus, a lawyer and an aggrieved indigene of Borno State, decried.\n\n\u201cHow can Boko Haram hoist its flag in Nigeria and nothing is happening, government negotiates ransom with bandits and kidnapers take a whole school or town hostage without challenge. Nigeria is in a war situation now,\u201d Bulus observed.\n\nFor the Lagos-based maritime lawyer, the country is fast drifting apart and the principals and political actors are not keen on saving the situation because it is going according to their long-hatched plans.\n\n\u201cIf government wants to calm the situation and restore peace across the country, it will do it. But it does not want for obvious reasons; instead, it is threatening to roll out tanks in some parts of the country. You heard what they reeled out as achievements since gaining power; in sincerity, have there been achievements in a country where government is witnessing ethnic cleansing and wanton killings every day and keep silent? For me, safeguarding the lives of the citizens is far better achievement, which this administration has failed to do\u201d, Terhumba Tor, a senior lecturer at a federal university said.\n\nFor him, the principles of democracy and ideals of civil living are not upheld by the present administration and Nigerians are not expecting any positive change in the remaking two years of the present administration.\n\nOkwui Duruike, director, Centre for African Leadership Ideals, an Abuja-based African economy and politics research outfit, which has relocated to Cotonou in Benin Republic, noted that Nigerians should not expect miracle in the remaining two years of this administration as the country has been falling in development, human right and democracy indices in the last five years.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted several researches on development, good governance and security in collaboration with international agencies across 30 African countries. Nigeria is among the worst in Africa, while Ghana, Seychelles and Gaborone are leading across many fronts. The Nigerian case is lack of will power by government to tackle insecurity, enforce necessary actions, restore peace, woo back investors and boost the economy. Stability of a country and economic development go hand in hand but that will not happen in the remaining two years,\u201d Duruike said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn one of our reports on the worsening insecurity, we advised one of our foreign partners to inform the Nigerian government that all they needed was sincerity of purpose, boosting morale of its security operatives, fishing out sabotage, working with locals and collaboration with foreign governments.\u201d\n\nConsidering the huge damage done across the country due to the inaction of government, Tor thinks that two years will not be enough to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want to start, or what are you going to promise that has never been promised in the past. I don\u2019t expect any relief in the remaining two years of this administration because the thousands killed will not come back, houses burnt, farms destroyed and hopes dashed cannot be restored. I expect the worst in two years,\u201d Tor said.\n\nFor Bulus, the change we desire cannot come now or within the remaining two years because the recent actions of this administration point to a people that are running against time.\n\n\u201cThis is six years after taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who was regarded by many as a weakling. One former governor of Lagos State even said during campaign that a serious government will fix electricity issue in one year. So, they have been there for six years now and the trouble is quadrupling, so where is their magic wand?\u201d Bulus asked.\n\nOn his part, Ademola Fadahunsi, a political analyst, noted that though South West is clamoring to take over from President Buhari in 2023, the damage done so far is huge and will take almost the whole tenure of an incoming president to restore.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that we don\u2019t value human lives again. The killing is much, the country is soaked in blood and no matter how much infrastructure you put in place, you need living humans, peaceful country and stability for such infrastructure to be meaningful. They flagged off Lagos-Ibadan rail, but Abuja-Kaduna rail is besieged by bandits. Why not tackle insecurity first before investment that is already threatened by current realities in the country?\u201d Fadahunsi said.\n\nHowever, observers note that insecurity is the biggest issue in the country today and that every effort of this administration should be channeled to address it. Yet, they don\u2019t see any difference in the current situation within the remaining two years of this administration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fool Nigerians by promising them a quick fix of insecurity in two years when since Jonathan\u2019s tenure, the country has been spending on security without result. We have witnessed change of security chiefs and increased budgets on security, yet no result. It will definitely get worse in the remaining two years of Buhari,\u201d Angwe Yakubu, a retired senior security personnel, said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Shamdam Plateau State-born retiree and now poultry farmer, said the fight against insecurity does not require huge spending on heavy armament, but will power and sincerity on the part of government, better treatment for soldiers, welfare for families of dead soldiers, empowerment of locals and collaboration with foreign countries to win.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to rhetoric that Boko Haram and bandits carry more sophisticated weapons. Can\u2019t such weapons be bought by Nigeria? All we need is sincerity of government to fight these terrorists, military to fight sabotage in its midst, locals to help with useful information and foreign partners to be given required information and free hand to work,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nAccording to him, this is the only way the remaining two years of this administration will make a difference, but he does not see them toeing the solution line.\n\nTunde Daramola, a politician, is not optimistic about a turnaround in the next two years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe ship of the state has been grounded by the present administration of Muhammadu Buhari. The first responsibility of a reasonable government is the security of lives and property. Presently, no Nigerian is safe; people are scared to go out and work or even travel. This APC- led government is a failure.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daramola, \u201cThe President is clueless on providing security for Nigerians not to talk of foreigners. No foreigner would come into Nigeria and invest with the level of insecurity today.\n\n\u201cNobody is happy and Nigerians are disappointed. It is a shame. I think the situation will get worse before 2023, or is it not getting even worse? Is the sign not there?\u201d\n\nBe believes that \u201cThis government appears overwhelmed with the situation; even the President confirmed it in the interview. I think these terrorists have some form of support, or how would you explain the situation now in the North where terrorists write letters to a community and come the same day to carry out an operation without any form of resistance?\n\n\u201cNigerians want this government to end today, not even tomorrow or 2023. Except for divine intervention, I don\u2019t see the situation improving. On the way forward, I am of the view that the President should urgently seek foreign help and intervention since he has admitted that the situation has overwhelmed him.\u201d\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a political analyst, said there was nothing more to expect from Buhari\u2019s remaining two years than what Nigerians have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cThe government has lost touch with the people and they are even sinking deeper with their attempt to stifle media and social media. It is only when a government feels terribly defeated due to bad governance that they tend to clamp down on media and other forms of communication used by citizens to express their displeasure,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe level of insecurity is getting worse by the day, as you can see; another set of students has just been kidnapped in the Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome that people are now hired to welcome or protest in favour of Buhari; a truly performing government will not hire people; this goes to show that Buhari is not popular among Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is left for the government to review its actions and activities or continue to allow citizens to suffer, first time ever where Nigerians now buy yam pieces due to food inflation and increased poverty rate,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Is Nigerian Senate playing politics with PIB, Electoral Act and Constitutional Amendment?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the 9th Senate had a special session to celebrate its anniversary. The occasion afforded the senators the opportunity to sing their praises and what they said they have been able to achieve individually and collectively within the last two years.\n\nDespite being seen as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 Senate, one acclaimed major achievement of the 9th Senate was the interventions in restoration of the national annual budget to the January-December cycle.\n\nAnalysts have said the measure has made the nation\u2019s fiscal plans more predictable and boosted the confidence of local and foreign investors in the economy.\n\nThe federal lawmakers also mentioned the passage of the Deep Off-Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act CAP D3 LFN 2004 (Amendment Bill, 2009). The senators passed the important law to increase Nigeria\u2019s share of revenue from its crude oil.\n\nFor ease of doing business, the Finance Bill 2019 (Nigeria Tax and Fiscal Law) (SB.140), which amended seven existing tax laws and Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20 LFN 2004 (Repeal and Reenactment) Bill 2019 (SB.270) were also passed by the lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the current Senate headed by Ahmad Lawan has not gained the confidence of majority of Nigerians, who have continued to criticise the upper chamber and indeed the National Assembly of always doing the bidding of the executive, thus ignoring proper oversight and legislation.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from the frosty relationship that played out between the executive and legislative in the 8th Senate, President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had to ensure that someone loyal to the president and the ruling party emerged as the President of the Senate. So, the emergence of Senator Ahmad Lawan from Yobe North Senatorial District and Ovie Omo-Agege from Delta Central Senatorial District as president and deputy Senate president, respectively, was largely seen as mission accomplished.\n\nThe usual bickering commonly displayed by both arms of government and the rejection of Mr. President\u2019s nominees in the 8th Senate led by Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki has since been buried. Two years in the life of the current Senate, the relationship between the executive and legislature has been cordial.\n\nUnlike the 9th Senate, the 8th Senate always did their due diligence and oversight before passing anything from the executive, be it a bill or confirmation of a nominee(s). For instance, one case that stood out and has continued to be applauded by Nigerians was the rejection of Ibrahim Magu as the substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was rejected by the lawmakers on two different occasions based on a security report against his nominee from the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nSimilarly, the $30 billion loan request of the president to the 8th Senate was also rejected to save the country from sinking deeper into indebtedness. In his letter, Buhari explained that the amount was Federal Government\u2019s 2016 to 2018 external borrowing plan meant to execute key infrastructural projects cutting across all sectors with special emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, water supply, growth and employment generation.\n\nBut the Senate Committee Chairman on Loan and Foreign Debt in the 8TH Senate, Shehu Sani, explained that they rejected the loan request from Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigeria from \u201csinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap.\u201d\n\nHe further argued that the lawmakers did not want the country to be re-colonised by creditor banks.\n\nUnfortunately, it is no longer the case under the current leadership as majority of the senators, especially in APC, are hitherto seen as willing tools in the hands of the President.\n\nAs a way of returning back the favour done to him,November 2019, expressedwillingness to approve all requests that come to the Senate from President Muhammadu Buhari when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, ItseSagay (SAN), paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja.\n\nHe quickly backed up the statement by saying that \u201cany request that comes from Buhari is good for the nation and the Senate will take immediate action on them.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cI want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it did not come as a surprise when the President\u2019s $30bn loan request was approved by the Lawan-led Senate. Additionally, in April 2021, the Senate approved the sum of $1.5bn and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the Federal Government.\n\nThe loans were part of the $5.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings Buhari had, in May 2020, asked the Red Chamber to approve to finance various priority projects of the Federal Government and to support the state governments facing fiscal challenges.\n\nAgain, the Senate on June 1, 2021 referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan request to borrow N2.343 trillion from external source to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt.\n\nBesides, on May 18, 2021, Buhari had sought the approval of the Senate to borrow a fresh N2.343 trillion ($6.18bn) external loan. The committee was subsequently mandated to look into the request of the President on Donor Fund Projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan and submit its report within two weeks.\n\nMore worrisome is the fact that the 9th Senate has not been able to pass the much-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) despite assurances of early passage.\n\nThe bill was passed into second reading in October 2020 and in January 2021, there was a public hearing on it where the President of the Senate said by May 2021, they would pass the bill. But sadly, that has not been the case. He has back-tracked to say that the PIB will now be passed by June 2021 as both committees in the upper and lower chambers are now writing the final report.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly was to pass the PIB in May, however, there was need to put in place a legislative framework to further encourage foreign investments and development in the industry.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I think they (Joint Committee of the two chambers of the National Assembly on PIB) are about to start writing the report, which they will lay before the two chambers of the National Assembly, probably by the middle of June.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed a sad commentary that a bill of such nature, capable of entrenching transparency and accountability in the oil sector, has not been pass into law after about 20 years it was first. introduced.\n\nNonetheless, the Electoral Act Amendment bill is one bill Nigerians are calling the 9th Senate to also expedite action on in view of the 2023 general election. In fact, INEC, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), political parties, the media and other stakeholders have been voicing out, even protesting on the need to pass and sign the bill into law.\n\nAs violence and all manner of rigging have continued to blight the electoral process, the passage and signing of the bill into law now becomes imperative in view of the Anambra gubernatorial election coming up on November 6, 2021.\n\nLawan has again promised Nigerians that the Electoral Act Amendment bill and the Constitutional Amendment bill will the passed by mid July 2021 before going on recess.\n\nThe lawmakers are currently on a two-week break and will resume on June 22, 2021. Therefore, between June 22 and July 15, 2021 when they are expected to go on their summer break, the question is: can they pass these bills within 23 days?\n\nSpeaking on an interview session on Channels Television Sunrise Daily, Friday, June 18, 2021, AjibolaBashiru, Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, expressed the optimism that the PIB, Constitutional Amendment Bill and Electoral Act Bill would be passed before the legislators proceed on their summer break.\n\n\u201cI am particularly optimistic that we will meet the expectation of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 109 senators should bear in mind that history bacons on them at this critical time to always do the right thing by enacting and passing laws that would stand the text of time.\n\nIn their oversight function, they must carry out thorough screening and confirm only qualified nominees of Mr. President, and not all manner of persons sent to them just to please the Presidency.\n\nThey should serve Nigeria and Nigerians as their priority, not sycophantic allegiance to the President, to the detriment of the country.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Empowering women key to curbing insecurity, poverty \u2013 Activist",
          "text": "Christybelle Sylva John, Coordinator, Ray of Hope Empowerment Foundation, says her sole mission is empowering more women and children, whom she believes are crucial pegs in addressing Nigeria\u2019s developmental challenges.\n\nThrough her foundation, she continues to reach out to impoverished women and indigent children, helping them find succour in the current economic downturn. She shares her philanthropic experiences with PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nPT: A bit more about yourself\u2026\n\nChristybelle: I am from Enugu State but lived all my life in the North. I schooled in Zaria, Jos and a bit of Enugu State and Abuja.\n\nPT: How many languages do you speak?\n\nChristybelle: I speak Hausa, English and a bit of Yoruba.\n\nPT: Can you tell some memorable things you recall growing up?\n\nChristybelle: I had a fantastic upbringing. I had a father, who was a strict man, who had a military background and a mum who was a teacher. We may not be from a rich family but we had a comfortable life.\n\nPT: Looking at you, and at the humanitarian streak, how would you say you came about it?\n\nChristybelle: I grew up in a very large family. We were just six of us from my father, but we had a lot of people who lived with him. When we were going to school then in ABU Zaria because my dad is someone who loves education so much, he invested in the lives of a lot of people.\n\nHe believes he may not give you all you want but knowledge is something he will give you and no man can take it. I saw him take care of other people\u2019s needs so I grew up with that mentality.\n\nPT: We still want to know about your passion for the vulnerable having seen some of your field projects\u2026\n\nChristybelle: Growing up in the North, I saw those who were highly placed, I saw others \u2018placed below\u2019. You see a lot of children coming to particular house singing songs and waiting for the owner of the house to come to give them food and I feel it\u2019s not supposed to be so.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to make noise when we see people who are in need so that was what prompted me to start this programme and before even this organisation was registered when I was in school I have always been this kind of passionate person who does not want to see people in need suffer.\n\nWhen I was in secondary school, each time we were going back to school my dad will tell me \u2018I know you, by the time you get back to school go and share the provision and start calling me again for new ones\u2019. This was because I couldn\u2019t stand seeing people ask for help and if it is within my reach, I cannot say no. When I was in university I used my little money to visit the motherless baby homes. This was what I started in school and I grew up and I felt there was a need to continue.\n\nPT: What is the story behind the name of your outfit?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChristybelle: When you are in a dark place and you see a glimpse of light, what it shows is that there is hope for you. That was how I came about the name.\n\nPT: Tell us about the major projects you have handled in the past?\n\nChristybelle: Yes we have done several \u2018back to school\u2019 outreaches in the last few years which is our usual programme for our children from low income families. We have done women empowerment programmes in many cities. We have done medical outreaches which we tagged \u201chealth on the wheels\u201d where we go to communities and those at the rural areas.\n\nPT: If you were to give a number, how many Nigerians have you reached through these projects so far?\n\nChristybelle: We have lost count since 2013. But I can conservatively say we have reached over 50,000 people. We have done programmes in Kaduna, Kastina, Imo, Enugu, Abuja and Zamfara in the past few years.\n\nPT: Who is sponsoring these projects?\n\nChristybelle: I started with my funds but sometimes I run to my parents for assistance. People who valued what we were doing supported us. With the help of social media when we are having an event, we put it out there and people rally support for us financially.\n\nPT: Can you share some of your challenges on the field?\n\nChristybelle: Sometimes, when you get to some communities and you write to them seeking permission, you experience bottlenecks. In some places in the North when you are trying to bring in programmes like family planning, it is difficult. The women tell you they can\u2019t stop having children until God stops them.\n\nPT: You have seen the level of poverty and insecurity in society, what will you say triggers it? How do you think this can be solved?\n\nChristybelle: It\u2019s a chain reaction, how do you change it when so many children are not properly educated and are roaming the streets. To break this you have to get them informed.\n\nPT: Our population is growing, do you think this has also contributed to this?\n\nChristybelle: Yes, I have a small family and I know the cost of taking care of these children, how much more a man who has 19 children. That why we are having issues of terrorism and kidnapping. These are children who could not get the paternal care they need, so they go into the street to care for themselves. If you don\u2019t take care of them, they might become prey in the hands of the predator.\n\nPT: Going forward, what do you think the solution could be?\n\nChristybelle: Empower our women, who are the foundations of families. Take the children off the streets. We should put in relevant policies that target our women and children. If everything was working for them (women, children), I don\u2019t think we will have the level of crime and insecurity we have now.\n\nThese children feel how can one man come and acquire the whole wealth that belongs to an entire state. When you are put in a leadership position, you are expected to provide basic amenities. But is this always so? The time will come when the children you don\u2019t provide for will fight you or your children.\n\nPT: What are the programmes you have planned?\n\nChristybelle: We have an ongoing programme which we started in March to commemorate the day of the women globally. It is called \u2018Women rising against poverty\u2019. We started March 20. We have empowered some women with start-up funds to boost or start a new business. The next programme that we are going to be doing after concluding this is Menstrual Hygiene, where we will create awareness in rural areas and distribute sanitary pads.\n\nIn September, we will continue our regular \u2018Resume back to school\u2019, where we support children from low-income families with necessities to be able to excel in life. We donate free books, bags and other accessories. Those who are not able to pay their schools fees, we place them under our scholarship.\n\nPT: Any interesting experience on the field you would like to share?\n\nChristybelle: Two. There was a child I saw her by the roadside one day, she was supposed to go to school, but I saw her crying. I asked what was wrong. She said they were supposed to be writing an exam in the coming week but she is yet to pay her fees. That was in 2019. We didn\u2019t want her to miss that term so we spoke with her mum, paid her fees and since then she has been under our scholarship.\n\nDuring one of our programmes on Menstrual Hygiene, we visited a school in Zaria. There we saw over 300 students, sitting on the floor, no seats. I came back to Abuja, mobilised funds and we bought 300 desks for them. There are many more stories.\n\nPT: So what motivates you?\n\nChristybelle: Seeing smiles on people\u2019s faces and making the world a better place.",

          "text": "Success Nwogu\n\nThe leader of the Nigerian Red Card Movement, Dr. Abdulmumin Yinka Ajia, has said that the proposal by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years, will be a mirage if Nigerians would not discard their alleged mutual distrust of one another and learn to work together towards a common and a collective goal.\n\nAjia, in an interview with Saturday Times, on Friday, said Nigerians must collborate, unite and work together to address insecurity, seccession threats, kidnapping, banditary, herders\u2019/farmers clashes, dwindlling economy and other developmental challenges confronting the nation.\n\nHe lamented that Nigerians currently faced food insecurity, poor electricity supply, inflation, fall of the naira and other socio-economic and industrial challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom having constant electricity, water supply, good schools, cheap and affordable food, and good medical care in the 70s and early 80s for men and women of my generation, the reverse is the case in today\u2019s Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe greater irony is that Nigeria has birthed two generations that were born and are living through a Nigeria that never worked for them. These two generations, precisely, the millennials and Generation Z have been served the short end of the stick by the Nigerian state. We should all work to avert the same fate falling on the Alpha generation. And yet, there is hope that if we work hard at it, we can reverse the tide and build a Nigeria that works for all.\n\n\u201cWe can engender a nation of consequence, a place where positive action is rewarded and negative, harmful actions are vehemently sanctioned and punished. The Nigerian people have had enough of maladministration and deepening poverty. In recent time, we have faced and continue to face, an unprecedented level of insecurity but we cannot give into fear, we must come together to defeat all the non \u2013 state actors and win the future for ourselves and our children.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt should concern each and every one of us that the generation of children born since 2010 (the Alpha generation) have already started witnessing the daily struggles of life in Nigeria. Yet, between my generation \u2013 generation X, the millennial generation and Generation Z, we constitute the largest voting bloc in Nigeria. According to the most recent data on Statista, Nigerians aged 15 to 54 years constitute 49. 7 percent while Nigerians aged zero to 14 years constitute another 43.3 percent. The rest of the population share just seven percent.\n\n\u201cThe question now is: How did we arrive at a point where the minority is lording it over the majority and mismanaging their affairs?\n\nThe answer is that we allowed it to happen to us. Because we did not realize the power in our collective hands. Going forward, I declare before the Nigerian people, that minority rule will not persist in Nigeria anymore.\u201d\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to build ecosystems that will foster innovation, create jobs, and brings foreign direct investments.\n\nHe said it important to retrain unemployed workers to get jobs in new emerging industries as according to when families are working and ther children are in school learning, the future of the nation becomes brighter and better.\n\nHe canvassed for the digitisation of all government transactions, adding the government should pursuepaperwork reduction to foster continuous ease of doing business.\n\nAccording to him, it is also important to ensure import substitution, reduce government participation in the oil and gas sector to regulatory only; and institute a regime of tax refunds to eligible individuals and households annually.\n\nAjia said, \u201cFG should set the deadline for filing annual tax returns to June 30th of every year; eliminate oil subsidies; liberalize port operations and adopt global best practices.\n\n\u201cFG should invest 30 percent of the national budget on education and education related areas because investing in our teachers and students is investing in the job creators of tomorrow, today. There should also be free and compulsory Primary 1 to SSS3 education.\n\n\u201cGovernment should also create the Education Bank for the financing of post \u2013 secondary education; grant post \u2013 secondary institutions full autonomy while retaining statutory government regulatory oversight; promote STEM education and institute scholarship schemes for high achieving indigent students attending post \u2013 secondary institutions.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there should be a new primary and post \u2013 primary education curriculum to meet the challenge of the 21st century.\n\nHe also called for political reformation, national census, encouragement of states to create local government administrations for every 100, 000 people.\n\nREAD ALSO: All you need to know about Sickle Cell Disorder\n\nHe added that each state should replicate security outfits like the Police, State Security Service, and Correctional Centres.\n\nHe said that the gendarmes will double as the state national guards that can be activated by state governments during times of emergency in liaison with the federal government.\n\nAjia said, \u201cThere should be the creation of an Elders Advisory Council to comprise foremost traditional rulers from each state of the federation and Federal Capital Territory. This list should include others with sterling reputable. This will help us to form a society where we govern with consensus not force.\n\n\u201cWork with the national assembly to amend the law as it relates to the FCT in order to create a stronger local administration in the Abuja Municipal Area Council and amend the law to remove unelected Federal ministers administering the federal capital territory.\n\n\u201cThese policies are not exhaustive but are some of the clearest and most meaningful ways by which we can reposition Nigeria given the level we have sunk into. These are the policies that will stop the hemorrhaging of the Nigerian state and position us to gain a competitive edge in the 21st century.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: South East should produce the President \u2013 Shehu Sani",
          "text": "By Success Nwogu\n\nA human rights activist, Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District from June 2015 to June 2019 in this interview with SUCCESS NWOGU on the sidelines of a summit, convened by the leader of the Nigerian Red Card Movement, Dr. Abdulmumin Yinka Ajia, titled, \u201cMasses awakening and elite patriotism: The search for a better Nigeria,\u2019 addresses national issues:\n\nPeople are concerned about Nigeria. How do you feel about the nation currently?\n\nWe should be concerned; the separatist agitation in the South Eastern part of Nigeria is a threat to peace. It has the possibility of destroying the region economically and those who are engaged in this must stop.\n\nSecondly, we should also build a process where there should be a dialogue with people who are thinking that breaking Nigeria is the solution. Afterall, those separatists, whether they are Sunday Igbogho or Nnamdi Kanu, were once patriots who believed in Nigeria.\n\nSo what made them to divorce themselves from Nigeria and now want to break it?\n\nLet us examine those issues and work towards addressing them for a united country.\n\nLet us show those who believe in Nigeria that they have made a right choice and by doing that, we disappoint those who want to break the country.\n\nWhat is the import of burning public infrastructure such as facilities of Correctional Centres, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) among others? What is your advise?\n\nIt is condemnable to destroy public facilities, to attack the police, to burn INEC facilities and attack federal establishments. The perpetrators are simply destroying themselves.\n\nThis is happening mostly in the South-Eastern part of Nigeria. The Igbos have grown to be an economic power in Nigeria.\n\nThey are not just dominant in the South Eastern part of Nigeria, they are dominant in all parts of the country.\n\nIn Abuja today and in all parts of the north, they are there in the servicing industry, real estate, manufacturing and commerce, they are dominant. Now how do you want to shrink them to a small space?\n\nThe Igbos of the 1940s and 1950s are not the Igbos of the 21st century.\n\nThe Igbos of the 21st century, is a king that has gone beyond his own domain to also rule over land, so how do you want to pull him backwards to where he had already progressed.\n\nA crisis in the South East is a threat to peace and order in the South Eastern part of Nigeria. We pray that South East does not become like North East because where people go to patronise goods, where people go to patronise industry; where people go for market, whether it is at Aba or Onitsha, if you create a situation of instability there, people will stop coming and that is very destructive.\n\nSo the Igbo of the 21 century is a king in many places. So you do not need to bring him back to be a king in a small place.\n\nWe have grown up and I can\u2019t imagine myself waking up and not seeing Uche, Chidinma, Eze, Ada and Chinwe. I can\u2019t imagine myself not seeing such people. Why should you be thinking of reducing the igbo man to a small territory when he has already conquered many territories.\n\nShould the South or precisely South-East, produce the President of Nigeria in 2023?\n\nOfcourse, it is legitimate for them to produce the next President. It is unfair, since 1999, they have never produced a President or a Vice-President. The same thing with the North Central.\n\nSo why can\u2019t they produce? They should be able to produce the President. It is a matter of consensus between the two major political parties to achieve that.\n\nI believe that such an attempt can crush the agitations (for secession). Igbos have been living in the northern part of Nigeria long before many of us who are northerners were born.\n\nAnd they have become a household and landlords. And they have developed assimilation with the society where they live.\n\nSo we must appreciate the northerners for the restraint too and for the hospitality which they have given people from other parts of the country.\n\nThe violence in the South East should be condemned but we should not judge the Igbos with the killings in the South Eastern part of Nigeria because as much as you can not judge the Hausas and northerners with the Boko Haram killings, you can not judge the whole Igbos with the gunmen killings.\n\nThose who are killing represent an insignificant number with the millions of people who are living in other parts of the country in peace. Let us not undermine the political and economic aspirations of that part of the country because of the activities of a few.\n\nWhat is your message for Nigerians on the summit, convened by the leader of the Nigerian Red Card Movement, Dr. Abdulmumin Yinka Ajia, titled, \u201cMasses awakening and elite patriotism: The search for a better Nigeria?\u2019\n\nThe message I have for Nigerians at a time like this, is that we should work hard for peace and continue to struggle to hold our government accountable.\n\nAt the same time, we should be ready to defend our freedom and our Constitution and gear ourselves, looking at the experiences that we have had in the last seven years, to make sure that the next generation of leaders are different in thinking, in thought, ideology and patriotism, from the ones which we have had in the last seven years.\n\nYour message to the leaders?\n\nThe leaders should know very well that power is transient. If you are in a position of leadership today, you should build a nation where tomorrow when you are out of office, you will be comfortable, safe and protected. They should see the opportunity to serve as God\u2019s privilege to them and they should serve their people and not to oppress them. They should look to having a more dignified nation where we all have a sense of belonging and peace.\n\nThe summit was convened by a young Nigerian, Yinka, what is your message to people like him?\n\nYinka is an inspiration to young people in this country. For him to have led a forum like this where a platform is provided without public funds, for people to come and truly express their opinions, he is one patriot that all Nigerians, young people, should appreciate. People should not wait for the government to organise a forum for them to go and express their opinions.\n\nThey should be able to organise themselves. A forum like this is an enlightenment process, an education process and an opportunity to exchange ideas and views and also hold the government to account. This is what I call the Peoples\u2019 Parliament, where people come to give ideas on how their country can be governed.\n\nThere are concerns that the rights of Nigerians under democracy including protest and opposition are being strifled? What is your take on such a development?\n\nIt is important that our leaders should know how delicate and fragile Nigerian democracy is. Leaders who have assumed the position of political power should not shrink the democratic space and deny other people the right to stay and enjoy. We have been through one political party that has ruled this country for sixteen years. The experiences are clear.\n\nWe have also been through another political party that is in power for the last seven years. And it is clear to us that our answers and solutions do not lie with one magician or one messiah. It lies within ourselves.\n\nREAD ALSO: All you need to know about Sickle Cell Disorder\n\nIf we leave governance to politicians, we should know that they are driven by interest and power. And as such the need for civil society, the masses, to continue to agitate for what is theirs. The poor man in the north is suffering like the poor man in the south.\n\nThe rich man in the south is comfortable like the rich man in the north. We should see ourselves based on our class differences: people who have not and people who have more than enough. And for us as a country, we have no alternative. Let us do what is right to strengthen this union and this bond for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nThere is no doubt that people in authority can be adverse to criticism. It is ironic that people who protested years ago are against protest; people who spoke the truth years ago are also against people who are speaking the truth today.\n\nOur diversity is wealth, it has the opportunity and the platform to make this country great. Government should learn to tolerate criticisms, and embrace ideas from people who necessarily are not within the corridors of power. Solving the problems of this country is beyond partisanship.",

Even after the lockdown was eased, it remained that way.\n\n\u201cThe people you will find in the church premises are mostly expatriates that are maybe there for special prayers and have an appointment with the man of God.\n\n\u201cServices have been done mostly online on Emmanuel TV. He was one of those pastors that adhered strictly to the health precautions and directives of the government and health professionals\u201d.\n\nPM NEWS had reported that burial plans unveiled by the church shows that Prophet T.B. Joshua would begin final journey home from July 5, 2021.\n\nSCOAN, in a statement issued late Monday unveiled a week-long burial plan for Joshua, leading to his burial at the church\u2019s premises.\n\nJoshua would begin his journey home between July 5 and 11. The week-long event will be used in honour of Joshua\u2019s life and legacy.\n\nThe statement said everyone was aware that TB Joshua had been taken home to be with the Lord, assuring that nothing would stop the work of God at SCOAN from moving on.",

          "text": "The latest declaration by the southeastern Governors, who convened in Enugu State on Saturday, sparked fury among Igbos.\n\nAccording to NewsDirect, the region\u2019s five governors denounced the secessionist group Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on Wednesday, claiming that the group does not speak for the Igbos.\n\nChairman of the Southeast Governors Forum, David Umahi, said they believe in one Nigeria while speaking to reporters shortly after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting\u2019s goal was to find answers to the region\u2019s existing insecurity, particularly in Imo, Abia, Anambra, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in totality, the activities of violent secessionist groups in the South East and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe firmly proclaim that we do not support them, they do not speak for the South East.\n\n\u201cThe impression that South-East leaders are silent over some of our youths\u2019 agitations for secession is not correct.\n\n\u201cSouth-East Governors, Ohanaeze President, National Assembly members, notable leaders had come out publicly many times in the past to speak against such agitations.\n\n\u201cIn order not to mismanage the unfortunate situation, South-East leaders have set up a committee to engage such youths to stop and allow elders to speak to address such fears,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, some residents of the region resorted to social media to criticize the governors for making decisions that do not reflect the common will of their constituents.\n\nHere are some of the Facebook reactions:\n\nOmesi Bonn Pillar said, \u201cSoutheast governors forum cannot speak for the youths and of course we have decided to exit Nigeria whether or not the governors want it.\n\n\u201cThe said governors have mortgaged our future for so long until the advent of IPOB which has come to rescue and set us free by process of giving us Biafra\u2014and that we have aligned with. We are asking for a referendum in order to settle everything\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ifeanyi Ejimkonye, \u201cIt\u2019s quite unfortunate, disheartening and irritating that south east governors can officially disown IPOB and support one Nigeria with the high level of marginalization just because of their selfish interest. I am so ashamed of so-called Southeast Governors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou people should continue showcasing stupidity, greediness and insensitivity. It\u2019s now obvious that you people are not speaking for Igbos. Chukwu Okike Abiama will punish you people one after the other.\u201d\n\nBob Eluwa: \u201cMiserable five persons\u2019 opinion doesn\u2019t matter concerning the future of about 40 million people\u201d.\n\nVictor Mbaka, \u201cSouth east governors nobody is begging you people to support us agitating for Biafra only God support we are asking for because I know the problem we are facing in the South East from you people call governors but as far as everybody is still alive you people call governors most reap it, all the blood of Innocent youth you people will face the judgement when time comes\u201d.\n\nThe situation is not different from Twitter as many who, despite the ban on the microblogging platform, expressed their opinions using the medium.\n\nNewsDirect compiled some of the reactions as follows:\n\n@Suitzio: \u201cInstead of them after a long deliberation, we\u2019ll be engaging our people in the coming weeks to know exactly what they want, as it appears Nigeria is drifting off course. For now we urge our people home and abroad to be calm and work for the peace and progress of SE\u201d.\n\n@Stevedameze: \u201cWho are these \u201cSoutheast Governors?\u201d Do we really recognize them? I am not sure if they know that they don\u2019t speak for the Igbos. They\u2019ve lost any credibility & a vote of no-confidence has been passed on them. The so-called governors don\u2019t even have a word of their own\u201d.\n\n@Nj99625368: \u201cAn adult do not need the consent of his parent to become a Gay/Lesbian. The so-called Leaders must understand that their consent is never needed for us to have a different political opinion. It\u2019s called \u201cRight to choose just as they have chosen which party to belong\u201d.\n\n@KennyAry1: \u201cWhen was the last time any of our politicians listened to the yearning of the people and acted on their behalf? The last time I checked these men have been representing themselves and not their people. What do y\u2019all expect when elections in black nations aren\u2019t \u2018election\u2019 but \u2018selection\u2019.\n\n@CharleslyObim0: \u201cThis is meaningless. Have they ever supported #IPOB #MaziNnamdiKanu.

Our various scriptures as Muslims and Christians allow us to put our lives at risk in defence of our honour, property and our faiths.\u201cIn what the bandits are doing, they have challenged all of us, so, we can\u2019t let them.\u201dBagudu asked the hunters to go back and fully mobilise, pending when he gets the necessary clearance from the security agencies, adding, \u201cwe will meet in the field.\u201dThe governor maintained that governors were not sworn in only to sit down in the office and work.\n\nHe stated that they are aware that one day they would be required to lead in the field, even though they are not military or police personnel.He said that if hundreds of thousands of people can be mobilised during campaigns, same should be done now to join the search party.He said: \u201cWhat happened in Birnin Yauri should be the last straw. We should follow these bandits wherever they are and take them on.\u201dBagudu also described the abduction as very callous, even as he lauded the security agencies, management of the school, \u2018Yan Sakai and vigilantes for their heroic efforts since the bandits struck at the college.\n\nCommiserating with Bagudu, the Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Feyemi said he was in the state as representative of Nigerian governors in solidarity with the Government and people of the Kebbi State to also commiserate over the unfortunate incident of banditry attack at FGC Birnin Yauri.He commended the efforts of the governor in making sure that schools in Kebbi get the necessary protection.He also acknowledged the efforts of the security for putting up a good fight against the bandits in the school.\n\n\u201cWe are here in solidarity with our brother, the governor of Kebbi State, and all the good people of Kebbi State on the unfortunate incident in Yauri,\u201d he said.The governor also charged the local hunters and the vigilantes to go after the bandits, annihilate them and bring back the school children.\u201cWe know as leaders of local hunters you will fight them in the bush and defeat them.\u201cWhatever you can do to make it the last one in Kebbi, please put up the effort,\u201d he charged the hunters.\n\nThe NGF Chairman also conveyed the sympathy message of President Muhammad Buhari to the people of Kebbi State, expressing how deeply concerned the president is over the Birnin Yauri incident.In the same vein, the Jigawa State Governor, Badaru Abubakar, expressed delight with the zeal and eagerness demonstrated by the local hunters and the vigilantes to partake in the rescue operation.He charged them to confront the abductors with all their arsenal until they are no more.Earlier, leaders of the local hunters told the governor of their readiness to join the fight against the bandits until the school children are all rescued.\n\nThe leader of the hunters in Gwandu emirate, Hassan Muhammad, Sarkin Dajin Sarkin Gwandu, told governor Bagudu that they were in Government House to show their solidarity with the rescue effort as well as join the security agents in fighting the bandits.According to him, they have no fear whatsoever in facing the bandits to save the school children but said they require support from the government.He said: \u201cWe have no fear to go to any bush, we have our magical skills but will not disclose them here until we are in the bush.\n\n\u201dSimilarly, other leaders of the Local hunters from Argungu and Augie local governments reaffirmed their resolve to lend a helping hand in the rescue operation.\u2018Our local hunters would join the operation as they are also ready to sacrifice their lives for the mission to succeed.\u201dThey requested for logistics assistance from the government for their members and the vigilantes.Alhaji Sani Hukuma Zauro, one of the elders of the hunters, was full of praises for governor Bagudu.\n\n\u2018We are in solidarity with governor Bagudu, we are aware of his prompt intervention and the positive results so far recorded in the rescue operation,\u201d he said.He described the quick response of the governor on the rescue effort as highly commendable, pointing out that no governor has achieved such a feat in Nigeria in similar situation of abduction.Zauro warned criminals to stay away from Kebbi State as they have no hiding place.

          "text": "Civil Society Organizations in Defence of Justice has expressed disappointment against the continued disobedience of court order by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC and the first generation bank.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, the Convener of the group, Comr. Sam Adah, called on the new Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa to flush out personnel who are fare being used by some bad elements to flout court orders, just as he stressed that the commission should rather be seen as one leading the fight against corruption which includes obeying the rule of law and not perverting justice.\n\nWhile citing the plight of some members of the Eleme Petrochemical Cooperative and Credit Society of INDORAMA Petrochemical Ltd , in Rivers State who he said have been seeking justice over issues regarding equity shares in the company, he also called for the immediate unfreezing of the cooperative\u2019s bank account in line with the orders of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cOn February 26, 2009, the federal government through the National Council on Privatization had approved the sale of 10% of its equity shares in Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd, Port Harcourt, Rivers State to the host community and interested staff of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Ltd. The 10% equity shares was shared as 7.5% was allotted to the host community while the remaining 2.5% was allotted to the Staff of Indoroma Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cInterested Staff came together under Eleme petrochemical co-operatives in compliance to the federal government directive that a special purpose vehicle be formed where all members will belong to enable them buy the shares.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, 10 staffs who initially subscribed to the purchase of the 2.5 equity shares had their jobs terminated from the employment of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cThis led to the beginning of a legal battle as to whether the laid off staff can continue to enjoy the dividends since they were no longer staff in the company.\n\n\u201cWhen the shareholding became an issue the laid off staff approached the River State Ministry of Commerce and Industry to arbitrate between it and the cooperative, the Ministry gave an Arbitral Award in favour of the laid off staff and consequently, the exited staffs of the co-operative approached the Federal High Court to enforce the arbitral award and as required by law it was granted and the award became a judgment of the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cThe judgement affirmed the laid off staffs as the authentic owners of the shares. It is of important to note that this judgement has not been appealed to this day.\n\n\u201cThis act continued until Justice Taiwo .O.Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Suit FHC/ABJ/SC/1222/2020 granted an Order stopping the EFCC from arresting, inviting, detaining and prosecuting or inquiring into the acquisition of shares of Indorama Petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cThis act continued until Justice Taiwo .O .Taiwo of the Federal high court in Suit FHC/ABJ/SC/1222/2020 granted an Order stopping the EFCC from arresting, inviting ,detaining and prosecuting or inquiring into the acquisition of shares of INDORAMA Petrochemicals ltd.\n\n\u201cWe urge the new Chairman of EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa to revisit the case and make sure that certain elements in the agency promoting abuse of court orders be arrested and dealt with accordingly.\u201d\n\nHe called on the EFCC rise to its mandate and responsibility and desist from been used by influencial and powerful Nigerians to intimidate poor Nigerians.\n\nOther demands includes that First Bank of Nigeria, without further delay should honour the order of the court and grant access to the funds in its custody.\n\n\u201cFirst Bank must realize that this very act has cost many loss to the members of the Co-operative especially the diseased ones, whose widows only livelihood depends on the funds in their custody.\n\n\u201cIf the impunity continues we will have no option than to commence legal Action against First Bank.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, had said that ongoing cases are not immediately made available to his office.",

There was no case of malpractice or system failure.To me, this is a great feet that JAMB has achieved so far.\n\nAlso, a proprietor and CBT centre owner of Ade- Ola Int\u2019l Schools, Mrs. Mercy Olaosegbe told our reporter that the JAMB examinations in her centre started successfully but experienced a hitch when the server went off.\n\n\u201d The examination was going on successfully, candidates came as early as 7 O\u2019 clock, had their thumb print, we started at the appropriate time, but along the line the server went off. This, actually caused a little delay, but thank God the technical officers were able to fix it as quickly as possible,\u201d said Olaosegbe.\n\nOn the parts of the candidates, especially those who had sat for UTME in the previous years, said there was no stress locating their centres , capturing their biometrics, and operating computer during the 2021 UTME.\n\nIn her own response, Ms Amu Bethel Chioma, one of the candidates said, the conduct was smooth except that questions encountered in the Chemistry were set outside the syllabus and were tough.\n\n\u201d There was no problem with the use of computer because it was the same computers we use for Mock exam that we still used but the only problem was the Chemistry, most things I read were not in the questions,\u201dshe said.\n\nAnother candidates, Odema Nfong from Spirited International School, said her problem was only Literature- in- English where most of the questions were set from the old syllabus.",

          "title": "SERAP Sues FG, Lai Mohammed Over Repressive Directive Asking Broadcasters To Stop Using Twitter",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit asking the Federal High Court in Abuja \u201cto stop the Federal Government and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed from using their patently unlawful directive to all TV and radio stations not to use Twitter, and to delete their accounts as a pretext to harass, intimidate, suspend or impose criminal punishment on journalists and broadcast stations simply for using social media platforms.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the order by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) asking TV and radio stations to \u201csuspend the patronage of Twitter immediately\u201d, and telling them to delete \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 Twitter after the social media giant was banned in the country for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/496/2021 filed last Friday, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining the government of President Buhari, the NBC, and Mr Lai Muhammed and any other persons from censoring, regulating, licensing and controlling the social media operations and contents by broadcast stations, and activities of social media service providers in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: South East Governors Condemn Violent Secessionist Groups, Back United Nigeria\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is also seeking \u201can order setting aside the directive by NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed asking broadcast stations to stop using Twitter, as it is unconstitutional, unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and the country\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that \u201cThe government of President Buhari, the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed have consistently made policies and given directives to crack down on media freedom, and the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression and access to information, and to impose crippling fines and other sanctions on broadcast stations without any legal basis whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cThe court has an important role to play in the protection and preservation of the rule of law to ensure that persons and institutions operate within the defined ambit of constitutional and statutory limitations.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cWhere agencies of government are allowed to operate at large and at their whims and caprices in the guise of performing their statutory duties, the end result will be anarchy, licentiousness, authoritarianism and brigandage leading to the loss of the much cherished and constitutionally guaranteed freedom and liberty.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cBy using the National Broadcasting Act and the Nigeria Broadcasting Code to stop broadcast stations from using Twitter without recourse to the court, the NBC and Mr Lai Muhammed have contravened the right to access to justice and fair hearing guaranteed under sections 6[1] & [6][b] and 36[1] of the Nigerian Constitution 1999, and articles 1 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare, Kehinde Oyewumi, and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cThe directive by the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed to broadcasters to delete their Twitter accounts is unlawful, as it amounts to a fundamental breach of the principle of legality, the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom, and incompatible with the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP and concerned Nigerians are entitled to the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom subject only to lawful restrictions. SERAP and concerned Nigerians frequently rely on the Twitter handles of many broadcast stations as sources of information for our activities in the promotion of transparency and accountability in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is a state party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which impose legal obligations on the government of President Buhari to ensure that the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom are respected, promoted, protected, fulfilled, and not unlawfully restricted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed have not shown any law breached by journalists, broadcast stations and media houses in Nigeria, and the government of President Buhari cannot use any disagreement with Twitter as a ploy to violate Nigerians\u2019 rights and undermine their individual businesses and professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drafters of the Nigerian Constitution well knew the danger inherent in special executive and legislative acts which take away the life, liberty, or property of particular named persons. They intended to safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted courts. These principles are so fundamental and must be respected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe directive to broadcast stations has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Twitter accounts by broadcast stations and media houses are their own properties acquired upon privity of terms and conditions formulated by the Twitter Inc. and accepted by the stations and media houses.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also asking the Federal High Court for the following reliefs:\n\n1. A DECLARATION that the directive by the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed to broadcast stations in Nigeria to deactivate their Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source of information gathering is unlawful, and amounts to a breach of the principles of legality and no punishment without law, and violation of the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom guaranteed under sections 39 and 22 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 [as amended], Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n2. A DECLARATION that the acts of the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed in relying on the National Broadcasting Act and the Nigeria Broadcasting Code to unilaterally direct broadcast stations to delete their Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter without recourse to the court amount to an infringement on sections 6[1] & [6][b], 36 and 44[1] of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], Articles 1 and 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n3. A DECLARATION that the provision of section 2[1][r] of the National Broadcasting Act and sections 5.6.3, 5.11.3 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code being inconsistent and incompatible with sections 36[1], 39, and 22 of the Nigerian Constitution, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\n4. A DECLARATION that the NBC and Mr. Lai Muhammed lack the power and authority to unlawfully impose penalties such as fines and other sanctions on any journalists and broadcast stations for using Twitter, and refusing/failing to deactivate their Twitter handles.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

The narcotic agents however restrained themselves and after hours of standoff succeeded in moving the suspects to custody.\n\nIn a similar vein, one Adelodun Kamaldeen has been arrested by operatives of the Oyo State Command of the Agency at General Area, Ilorin, Kwara State following the interception of a parcel containing cocaine and heroin that weighed 10.5grams and 4.8grams respectively on 13th June.\n\nThe following day, two ladies; Mary Peter, 40, and Mercy Oladele, 39, were arrested at Total Garden, Ibadan when NDLEA operatives acting on a tip-off, intercepted their commercial Micra car.\n\nThe two women were arrested with seven bags of cannabis weighing 77.23kg brought in from Ogbese, Ondo State, to supply a man they simply identified as Alhaji. According to them, they had earlier supplied the same Alhaji two bags before coming with the seven bags they were caught with.\n\nOn Friday 18th June, operatives of the Oyo State Command acting on intelligence also raided the residence of one Alhaji Faruq at Elebu area, Akala expressway, Oluyole LGA, Ibadan, where they recovered 43 ampoules of methylphenidate.\n\nIn Kaduna State, a drug trafficker, Segun Abraham was arrested at the Panteka area of the state on 17th June with 211.500kg of skunk heading to Kano state.\n\nMeanwhile, a Nigerian returning from Pakistan, Ezenyeche Kingsley Ebuka has been arrested by NDLEA operatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA, Ikeja Lagos with five pellets of heroin weighing 250grams discovered in his anus.\n\nThe suspect had arrived at the \u2018D\u2019 arrival hall of the airport on 14th June on a Turkish airline flight from Pakistan with the illicit drug inserted in his anus. He however failed to beat the eagle eyes of narcotic officers during the inward clearance of passengers on the flight.\n\nWhile commending the Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna, and the MMIA Commands of the Agency for sustaining the offensive action against illicit drug trafficking and the cartels running it, Gen. Marwa warned that the NDLEA will not spare any law enforcement agent hiding under the privilege of his uniform to engage in narcotic criminal business.\n\n\u201cThose who think they can sabotage ongoing efforts to rid Nigeria of the menace of illicit drug trafficking and abuse hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of their uniforms should better think twice because they\u2019ll have NDLEA to contend with. We\u2019ll not only arrest and expose them but we\u2019ll equally prosecute them and seize all assets acquired through the proceeds of their criminal act\u201d, he warned.",

          "text": "Emirates Airlines will resume flights to Nigeria from June 23, five months after it banned outbound flights from Abuja and Lagos. This followed the withdrawal of the Rapid Antigen Test the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had insisted passengers from Nigeria travelling to Dubai must take four hours before boarding their flights.\n\nIn another development, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) confirmed it had fixed the airfield light at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, Runway 18R, to enable flights land in the night. Regional Terminal Manager in charge of MMIA, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, stated this on Saturday in an interview with THISDAY.\n\nThe UAE antigen test requirement was against Nigeria\u2019s policy that passengers travelling out of the country should conduct Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 72 hours before their flight.\n\nBut on Saturday, UAE issued a statement conceding that Nigerian passengers that wished to travel to Dubai \u201cmust have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure.\u201d\n\nThe statement posted on Instagram by the Dubai media office also said passengers travelling from Nigeria should present a negative PCR test certificate with a QR Code from labs approved by the Nigerian government. It stated that all passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival in Dubai, adding, \u201cTransit passengers should comply with entry protocol of final destination.\u201d\n\nThe media office said the new regulation was part of measures aimed at easing inbound travel restrictions by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management. The committee introduced new entry protocols for passengers effective June 23.\n\nBesides the new condition for Nigerian travellers, UAE has new regulations for passengers travelling from South Africa and India to Dubai.\n\nFor South Africa, the new rules stipulate that passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cPassengers must present a negative test result for a PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure; UAE citizens are exempted. All passengers must undergo a PCR test on arrival at Dubai airport. Transit passengers should comply with entry protocols of final destination,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFor travellers from India, UAE said passengers should have received two doses of a vaccine approved by UAE authorities and passengers must have received a negative test result for PCR test taken within 48 hours before departure, in addition to the other conditions given to Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nConfirming the withdrawal of the antigen test, Emirates Airlines issued a statement signed by its management, which said, \u201cEmirates welcomes the latest protocols and measures announced by Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management to allow the safe resumption of passenger travel from South Africa, Nigeria and India to Dubai. We look forward to facilitating travel from these countries and supporting various travellers\u2019 categories.\n\n\u201cWe will resume carrying passengers from South Africa, Nigeria and India in accordance with these protocols from 23rd June. We thank the Supreme Committee for their continuous efforts in monitoring the development of the situation and announcing the appropriate guidelines and protocols to protect the community and safeguard travel sector.\u201d\n\nReacting to the new development, President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, said UAE had done what the Nigerian government wanted. Akporiaye said the new development had shown that no country could rubbish Nigeria if it insisted on a position popular with its citizens.\n\nThe NANTA president said there would be a price to pay if a country stood its ground, regretting that Nigeria had often tended to shy away from the reality of that price.\n\nAkporiaye stated, \u201cSome of the prices include the fact that many Nigerian students studying overseas that were due to travel back found it very difficult doing so without Emirates flights from Nigeria. We travel agents also paid a huge price because if Emirates flights were operating, we would have made money; we wouldn\u2019t have been at the state we are now financially.\n\n\u201cWe give kudos to the federal government and travel agencies. We will now wait for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to lift the ban on Emirates.\u201d\n\nUAE had made the Rapid Antigen Test compulsory for Emirates Airlines, which was to start administering the test on Nigerian passengers from February 4, 2021.\n\nIn response, the federal government temporarily banned the Middle East carrier, insisting passengers travelling out of Nigeria are only required to have PCR test 72 hours before their flight. The government said it did not have the facilities for the antigen test demanded by Emirates.\n\nFollowing Nigeria\u2019s insistence, Emirates banned its outbound flights from Nigeria and later its in-bound flights, which it had operated for several weeks after the ban on outbound flights.\n\nMeanwhile, for over one week the centre lights at the MMIA runway were unserviceable, prompting the agency to issue Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and provide bar stopper light at each end of the runways to guide pilots to land after dusk.\n\nShin-Aba told THISDAY that the airfield lighting on the runway had been fixed and all airlines could now land their planes at the airport.\n\nHowever, insider sources at FAAN told THISDAY that a temporary measure was put in place to enable flights land, as the second runway, known as Runway 18L (domestic runway), had no airfield lighting for years since its rehabilitation in 2008.\n\nThe status of the runway lighting before it was fixed on Saturday might have prompted British Airways to divert its Lagos flight to Abuja on Friday, but other airlines landed their flights at the airport in Lagos.\n\nThe FAAN regional manager stated, \u201cThe runway lights had been bad since over a week, but FAAN issued NOTAM to notify airlines and pilots globally, so any airline coming to Nigeria knew the problem with the runway.\n\n\u201cBut FAAN installed bar stopper light at the two ends of the runway to guide pilots that wish to land at the runway in the night. This is a big challenge for us because it is not about getting the airport certified; it is about sustaining the standard achieved to earn the certification.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why BA diverted its flight to Abuja, but the airline was aware of the status of the airport even before it left London to Lagos.\u201d\n\nChinedu Eze and Michael Olugbode",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has called on West African leaders to exert more pressure on the military leadership in Mali to ensure that the transition process in the country is not aborted.\n\nThe president\u2019s position was contained in his address on Saturday at the 59th Ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS in Accra, Ghana.\n\nMali was recently suspended from the regional bloc due to a military coup in the country.\n\nBuhari, who spoke extensively on the Malian situation, said, \u201cAt this Summit today, we are expected to review a number of important reports dealing with various issues of concerns to our organisation and people. In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions, which will positively impact our citizens.\n\n\u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily, will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want. Pressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is, unfortunately, under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as \u201cclearly under siege\u201d.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, Buhari cautioned them not to perpetrate acts that could destabilise and destroy their country.\n\n\u201cI urge our organisation to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly for his untiring efforts thus far. I encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d the president added.\n\nOn Libya, Buhari faulted the recent United Nations resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOn the security situation in the region, our organisation must note with serious concern the recent decision by the United Nations and its Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya without, first, ensuring that they are disarmed and that neighbouring countries and the Sub-regions were engaged, to put in place modalities for containing or managing the movement of these fighters.\n\n\u201cWhile this action was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders on this critical decision has now created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region, which could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\u201d\n\nThe president said these regions faced a clear possibility of instability with the invasion of the fully armed foreign fighters.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe speech by the Nigerian president at the Summit also addressed other issues of concern in the organisation, including the on-going institutional reforms in ECOWAS. He declared Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reform process, saying he looks forward to an ECOWAS that is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nBuhari commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms, as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have clearly realised that operating a bloated administration with the current global economic collapse occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic will be to the detriment of services to our people, which is not sustainable. This positive action will certainly enable our organisation move on and deliver services to the satisfaction of our Community citizens.\n\n\u201cLet me remind us that this is only the beginning as the responsibility of streamlining operational costs as well as the modalities for the appointment of statutory positions of the incoming management are still outstanding. It is my view that paying attention to existing regulations that guide the appointment of statutory appointees will further guarantee the efficiency and sustainability of the organisation.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Three days after the violent kidnap of more than 80 students, a majority of them girls, and five teachers at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, in northwest Nigeria, federal troops late Saturday night were believed to have rescued the rest of the kidnapped victims.\n\nThe troops, THISDAY gathered, were able to rescue the students and their teachers after closing in on the bandits and killings scores of them, before the rest abandoned their hideouts, leaving the victims behind.\n\nSpeculation, however, became rife over the alleged rescue of the students and their teachers, even though details were still unclear as to how the troops ultimately pulled off the rescue operations.\n\nAlthough a day after the raid by the bandits, the military too had moved swiftly, rescuing five students and two teachers, while announcing that one of the students, a female, had died in the forest.\n\nNigerian army spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu confirmed that a female student was found dead in the forest by troops tracking the kidnappers, adding that those who were rescued were freed after an exchange of fire in the early hours of Friday.\n\nWith support from the Nigerian Air Force, the troops also reportedly recovered about 800 stolen cattle from the grip of the bandits during the operation, the statement by Nwachukwu claimed.\n\nSo far, no official source could confirm the eventual rescue of the rest of the abducted students and their teachers at the time of filing this report, but a few other sources have confirmed the development, albeit without the requisite details.\n\nOne of the sources contacted early Sunday morning confirmed that the news of their alleged release had been swirling since late Saturday night, but that there was no concrete confirmation from any of the official sources as everyone seemed to have shut down.\n\n\u201cWe heard the news but no one has the details, much less seen any of the students. But the news has been circulating amongst certain class of people, who were confident that the students had been released,\u201d the source stated.\n\nBandits, on Thursday, kidnapped at least 80 students and five teachers from the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, killing a police officer in the process.\n\nA teacher from the school, Usman Aliyu, said the gunmen took more than 80 students, most of them girls.\n\n\u201cThey killed one of the (police officers), broke through the gate and went straight to the students\u2019 classes,\u201d the teacher reportedly told Reuters, a foreign news medium.\n\nKebbi State police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed that the gunmen killed one of their officers during an exchange and also shot a student, who had since been receiving medical treatment at an undisclosed hospital.\n\nThe Kebbi State Police Command further claimed that the vehicle used to convey the kidnapped students and teachers belonged to an unnamed High Court judge in the state.\n\nA resident, Atiku Aboki, who went to the school shortly after the gunfire stopped, said he saw a scene of panic and confusion as people searched for their children.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we saw students crying, teachers crying, everyone is sympathising with people,\u201d he also said to Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s kidnapping at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi, marked the third mass abduction from a school in Northwestern part of Nigeria in some weeks, with armed gangs carrying out the kidnappings for ransom. More than 800 students were believed to have been taken from their schools in the region since December.\n\nOnuminya Innocent in Sokoto",

          "title": "Israel Voices \u2018Grave Concern\u2019 Over Iranian President-elect Ebrahim Raisi",
          "text": "Israel has said the international community should have grave concerns about the election of Iran\u2019s new president-elect, Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nA spokesman for Israel\u2019s foreign ministry, Lior Haiat, said Mr Raisi is Iran\u2019s most extremist president yet. He also warned the new leader will increase Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\n\nEbrahim Raisi was declared the winner of Iran\u2019s presidential election on Saturday, in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him.\n\nMr Raisi, who will be inaugurated in August, is Iran\u2019s top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners.\n\nIn a statement following his victory, he promised to strengthen public trust in the government, and be a leader for the entire nation.\n\n\u201cI will form a hard-working, revolutionary and anti-corruption government,\u201d state media quoted him as saying.\n\nHowever in a critical Twitter thread, Israel\u2019s Lior Haiat said he is \u201can extremist figure, committed to Iran\u2019s rapidly advancing military nuclear program\u201d.\n\nIran and Israel have been in a long-running \u201cshadow war\u201d, which has resulted in both countries taking part in tit-for-tat actions, but so far avoiding all-out conflict. Recently, however, the hostilities between the two have escalated again.\n\nThe situation is complex, but one big source of tension is Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\n\nIran blames Israel for the murder of its top nuclear scientist last year and an attack on one of its uranium enrichment plants in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel does not believe that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is purely peaceful, and is convinced it is working towards building a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which saw harsh penalties lifted on Iran as long as it stopped some nuclear work, collapsed when former US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, and re-imposed the crippling economic sanctions. The Biden administration is now trying to work out a way to re-enter the deal.\n\nIn response to the sanctions being tightened, Iran stepped up its nuclear activities, and is currently enriching uranium at its highest levels ever \u2013 although still short of what is needed to make nuclear-grade weapons.\n\nCommenting on the election result, the US said it regretted Iranians were \u201cdenied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process\u201d.\n\nVoter turnout was at a record low for this election, with less than 50% of registered voters going to the polls, compared to more than 70% in 2017. Many people shunned the election, believing that it had been engineered in favour of Mr Raisi, who is a staunch ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nMr Raisi\u2019s win has come on the same weekend as negotiations to try and save the Iran nuclear deal continue in Vienna.\n\nThe EU has said another formal meeting will take place on Sunday between Iran and the six world powers involved in the deal. This is the sixth round of indirect talks between the US and Iran, and this week officials said the parties remain divided on some key issues, Reuters reported.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Lior Haiat called Mr Raisi the \u201cbutcher of Tehran\u201d, in reference to the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.\n\nMr Raisi was one of four judges, who became known as the \u201cdeath committee\u201d, which allegedly sentenced about 5,000 men and women to death, Amnesty International says. In his tweets, however, Mr Haiat said more than 30,000 people were killed, which is a number also referenced by Iranian human rights groups.\n\nRussia\u2019s Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate Ebrahim Raisi, highlighting the \u201ctraditionally friendly and good-neighbourly\u201d relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe leaders of Syria, Iraq, Turkey and the UAE sent similar messages of support and congratulations.\n\nA spokesperson for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, wished Iran \u201cprogress and prosperity\u201d.\n\nHowever, human rights groups have said Mr Raisi should be investigated for atrocities.\n\n\u201cAs head of Iran\u2019s repressive judiciary, Raisi oversaw some of the most heinous crimes in Iran\u2019s recent history, which deserve investigation and accountability rather than election to high office,\u201d Michael Page from Human Rights Watch said.",
