However, 20 years later, Soyinka queried President Muhammadu Buhari to make public the outcome of his investigations on Bola Ige\u2019s death.\n\n\n\nIn a letter he addressed to Mrs Funso Adegbola, daughter of late Ige, Soyinka condemned what he called the \u201cspate of political murders\u201d asking President Buhari what happened to his promise of opening enquiry into the spate of murders the country has witnessed in recent years.\n\nWith the theme \u201c20TH YEAR OF BOLA IGE MEMORIAL SYMPOSIUM, 2 DECADES OF INJUSTICE: WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS ON NIGERIAN DEMOCRACY\u201d organised by the BOLA IGE FOR JUSTICE CENTRE, the event witnessed prominent personalities that spoke against injustices in the country.\n\nRead the message bellow:\n\nMy dear Funso,\n\nAn eleventh-hour, sadly insurmountable impediment, alas, prevents my joining you on this bitter-sweet occasion. Bitter for obvious reasons, but also a source of joy, since it provides yet another opportunity for celebrating the passage of a remarkable individual \u2013 your late father \u2014 through the lives of the rest of us yet living. Let us be unstinting in our sustaining reminiscences.\n\nI particularly regret my absence, as it provides a mandatory, inescapable occasion for directing a question at the nation\u2019s current leader, President Buhari, a DEMAND that the entire nation, no matter the political inclination of her citizens, is morally obliged to make. MY message proceeds:\n\nPRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI, WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR ROBUST PLEDGE TO OPEN AN ENQUIRY INTO THE SPATE OF POLITICAL MURDERS THAT THE NATION HAS UNDERGONE IN RECENT YEARS?\n\nDOES IT ALL AMOUNT TO YET ANOTHER INSTANCE OF POLITICAL BRAVADO? WHILE WE ALL ACCEPT THAT ALL LIVES SHOULD BE VALUED EQUALLY, SOME IMPOSE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON THOSE IN GOVERNANCE.\n\nBOLA IGE, AS THE NATION\u2019S MINISTER OF JUSTICE, AND UNITED NATIONS\u2019 CIVIL SERVANT DESIGNATE, WAS UNARGUABLY ONE SUCH. A NATION\u2019S HONOUR IS IN QUESTION AND REMAINS SO UNTIL THE HOUR OF CLOSURE. THUS, SHE MUST NEVER RELENT IN DEMANDING AN EXPLANATION FOR HIS BRUTAL MURDER, EXPOSE THE PERPETRATORS, IDENTIFY THE CONSPIRATORS AND REINSTATE THE BROKEN LINES OF JUSTICE.\n\nAT THE VERY LEAST, WE NEED A FORMAL DECLARATION REGARDING THOSE WHO DISPLAYED AN ABNORMAL INTEREST IN THE FATES OF THOSE ACCUSED, TO A LEVEL OF PROVEN, DOCUMENTED INTERFERENCE BOTH IN THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND WITHIN THE JUDICIARY. I AM NOT ALONE IN HAVING WRITTEN AND LECTURED ON THESE SORDID ASPECTS THAT FUELLED THE SUBVERSION OF JUSTICE. THERE ARE SURVIVING WITNESSES.\n\nUNSOLVED CRIMES ONLY LEAD TO A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY. THIS PUTS THE ENTIRE NATION AT RISK, NO MATTER THE PRIVILEGE OF HIGH-LEVEL PROTECTION. THIS IS A LESSON THAT NIGERIAN LEADERSHIP HAS YET TO LEARN.\n\nPRESIDENT BUHARI, SHARE THE REWARDS OF YOUR INVESTIGATIONS \u2013 IF ANY!!!\n\nWole SOYINKA",

          "text": "A bill to protect children from abuse has been passed into law by the Jigawa State House of Assembly.\n\nHowever, the bill excluded the regulation of underage marriage in the state due to its religious inclination and other controversy.\n\nThe chairperson, House Committee on Justice and Judiciary, Abubakar Muhammad, who presented the bill before the house on Tuesday made this known to the press after plenary.\n\nMr Muhammad further said that the bill was designed in compliance with the Islamic model of the child protection bill.\n\nIn his words: \u201cThe issue of underage marriage is totally expunged in the bill. It is not part of the law. It is very difficult to determine the age of a girl that is ripe for marriage, thus, because of the controversial nature of it we expunged it totally from the bill.\n\nIn fact, any provision that was in contrast to Islamic principles and law, the culture of the Hausa and Fulani people was erased.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that though the Child Rights Protection Bill identifies a child as any person below the age of 18, they can still be explored for marriage.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which is meant to enhance the welfare of children in the state, also seek to maximize requisite care and protection for the children.\n\nIt equally seeks to offer higher protection to the vulnerable in the society and raise the status bar of cherished societal norms and values.\n\nAfter deliberations on the committee\u2019s report, the lawmakers unanimously passed the bill which now awaits the governor\u2019s assent to become law.\n\nWith the passage of the bill, Jigawa joins the league of Northwestern states to have done so leaving Kano and Zamfara state behind.\n\nJigawa State is said to have one of the highest rates of child marriage and street children (Almajiri) in the country with more than 80 percent of its girls married before their 18th birthday.",

          "text": "\u2018Monarch accused me of being too stingy with money\u2019\n\nAs governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande had problems with the immediate past Ooni of Ife, Oba Okuade Sijuwade, and the Owa-Obokun of Ijeshaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\nAkande, in his book, \u2018My Participations\u2019, said the late Sijuwade wanted him to plunge the state into debt by taking a loan for a water project the Oba had an\n\ninterest in.\n\nHe also said Oba Aromolaran was always saying bad things about him because of his belief that he was stingy.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that most of the obas did not want to associate with the Owa-Obokun, His Majesty, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\n\u201cOne day he came to me to complain that he had no car. I told him that Osun State had no money now to buy cars for traditional rulers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cBut his pestering was too much and I secretly sent money to him to buy a car.\n\n\u201cI went to meet him at his palace in Ilesha and told him that he should use the money I sent to buy a car. He then called Lere Adebayo.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know how much of the money he should return to me! Lere then told him, \u2018Don\u2019t try that with Akande o! Ajemonu tie niyen!!\u2019\n\n\u201cMaybe that was the practice before my time. A few weeks after that incident, the Commissioner of Police was changed and the new man was touring the state and when he got to Ilesha, the Owa called him aside.\n\n\u201cHe told the CP that the only person he should be careful of within the state was Governor Akande. \u2018He is too stingy with money,\u2019 Kabiyesi said. The Commissioner of Police reported to me.\n\n\u201cSo one day the Owa came again to report to me Mr Niran Fajuke, the chairman of the local government in Ilesha. He complained that Fajuke was not taking good care of him.\n\n\u201cI accused him, saying, \u2018Baba, you too are not sometimes a nice person.

Among the Obas and chiefs, the Owa seemed unpopular,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Owa had a long-standing grudge against Ooni Sijuwade who wanted to dominate the entire space.\n\n\u201cOoni wanted to make an entourage of the smaller obas with a view to tormenting the Owa and other obas who might be opposed to him. He would give them money.\n\n\u201cWhat worried me with bringing the smaller obas into the Council of Obas to make them have an equal ranking with the other paramount rulers was that it might undermine the age-old tradition of the Yoruba people.\n\n\u201cAs far as my government was concerned, only three obas were paramount in Osun State: The Ooni, the Orangun and the Owa,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added that when his old boss at BP, the Ajalorunof Ijebu-Ife, Ogun State, wanted to honour him with the traditional title of Jagunmolu Oodua, the late Ooni opposed it.\n\n\u201cHe wrote him a letter insisting that he being the Arole Oodua, was the only one who could confer a title with the word \u2018Oodua\u2019 as part of its name.\n\n\u201cHe warned that if Oba Oguntayo should go ahead he would incur the wrath of the Yoruba deities. The Ajalorun wisely went ahead and I received the title. The Ajalorun has been waxing stronger since then.\n\n\u201cThe Ajalorun is one of the most ancient of Yoruba traditional thrones and like all other leading obas, the throne originated from the House of Oduduwa in lle-Ife.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ijebu-Ife is regarded as a replica of the old Ile-Ife. But the problem I had with the Ooni was more serious and graver and it also had to do with money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the late Ooni wanted him to renew the Ede-Osogbo Waterworks which was to be repaired with $300 million.\n\nHe refused to sanction the deal.",

So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

Buhari also noted that adopting direct primaries has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government, as constitutionally insured.\n\nThe president said the conduct of direct primaries would lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties, as well as the increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nHe explained that the direct consequences of the high cost are monetization and that it will drive and increase the financial crimes and constitutes further strain on the economy. In his view, Buhari said it will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilize all party members for the primaries, a situation which he said is not healthy for the sustenance of multiparty democracy in Nigeria.\n\nHe further stated that security agencies will also be overstretched, as direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry.\n\n\u201cSuch large turnout without effective security coordination, will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues on the outcomes of such election\u201d, he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "\u201c The amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy, which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association.\u201d\n\n\u2022Wike: N\u2019Assembly lacks will power to override President\n\nObinna Chima\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, notified the National Assembly of his resolve to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nThe president in a letter to the leadership of the National Assembly, exclusively obtained by THISDAY, clearly highlighted his reasons for refusing to sign the bill into law.\n\nBuhari, whose letter to the lawmakers was obtained by THISDAY on the last day of the 30 days stipulated in the constitution for him to communicate his position on the bill, stressed that political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of either direct or indirect primaries to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities might permit.\n\nHe argued that direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 would significantly raise the cost of conducting primary elections by political parties and could have negative implications on the outcome of elections.\n\nIn the letter titled: \u201cWithholding of Assent to Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021,\u201d Buharistated: \u201cFurther to the letter dated 18th November, 2021 forwarded for Presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that arising from the review, it was worthy to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, \u201chas serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities.\u201d\n\nThis, Buhari further said, \u201calso has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\u201d\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the Bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010 to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC, who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts.\n\n\u201cThe addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitably lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the president held that the indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation were that it would raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy.\n\nIt will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries, he said.\n\nAccording to him, this would not be healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy, which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card-carrying members of any political party.\n\n\u201cThus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general election as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he noted that the proposed amendment might also give rise to \u201cplethora of litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of law including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries.\n\n\u201cThis real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral programme of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of Government in 2023. Nigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general election.\n\n\u201cThe direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over[1]monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants,who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries,\u201d he argued.\n\nBuhari also insisted that direct primaries would be subjected or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership register or valid means of identification, which therefore means non-members could be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome.\n\n\u201cRival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\n\u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit: Asides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association.\n\n\u201cIt is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially, in circumstances like ours,where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primaries to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit. Please accept, the assurance of my highest consideration and esteem,\u201d Buhari stated.\n\nWike: N\u2019Assembly Can\u2019t Veto Buhari\u2019s Refusal to Sign Electoral Bill\n\nRivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, has said the National Assembly lacked the temerity to veto President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s withholding of assent tp the Electoral Act amendment bill.\n\nHe said the reason was because it was part of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheme to allegedly deny Nigerians free, fair and transparent election in 2023.\n\nGovernor Wike spoke yesterday at the flag-off of Chokocho-Igbodo Road in Etche Local Government Area of the state.\n\nAccording to him, the only way for Nigerians not to repeat the 2015 and 2019 mistakes of voting the APC-led federal government into power was to send them packing in 2023.\n\nThe Rivers State governor recalled that, \u201cThree weeks ago I told Nigerians that there is a conspiracy not to have a free, fair, transparent election in 2023 and that conspiracy was very clear. And I told Nigerians, Mr President will not sign the Electoral Act amendment bill.\u201d\n\nWike stated that having known the modus operandi, style and strategy of the APC, it was obvious to him and all discerning minds that the clause on direct primaries was inserted into the Electoral Act amendment bill as a ploy for the president to refuse assent to the bill.\n\nHe said the APC members were afraid that if results were transmitted electronically, they would not survive the 2023 general election.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhat APC resolved in the meeting they had was that their problem is not necessarily direct primaries, but the electronic transmission of result in 2023. If they allow that, obviously APC will lose the election in 2023 and they told themselves that the only way we can survive that is to include the direct primaries in the bill so that Mr President can use that as an excuse, that he will not sign the bill.\u201d\n\nHe accused the APC governors and their National Assembly members of allegedly deceiving Nigerians that they were engaged in battle of supremacy over the issue of direct primaries, whereas they had secretly agreed to scuttle the possibility of transmitting election result electronically in 2023.\n\nThe Rivers governor said, unfortunately, the National Assembly does not have what it takes to veto the president\u2019s refusal to assent to the bill, because they were not interested in protecting the interest of Nigerians and ensuring that elections were free and fair with the electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you don\u2019t have a National Assembly that has what it takes, that will stand for the people, that will say, look, we were elected by the people and we want to give the people the best. Nobody in the National Assembly, not even the leadership can have what it takes to say Mr President, for the interest of Nigerians, we are going to veto this your refusal.\u201d\n\nThe governor maintained that because APC did not consider the interest of Nigerians as priority, its leaders were immersed in crisis, jostling for benefits that could fan their personal egos.\n\nHe said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was different, because it was waxing stronger as a true political party, and working everyday in improving the socioeconomic conditions of the people in PDP-controlled states.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sanwo-Olu: It\u2019s the largest bond ever by a sub-national in Nigeria\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday signed a N137.3 billion 10-year bond to finance key infrastructural projects in the state.\n\nAt 13 per cent, the debt instrument is under the N500 billion fourth debt series expected to run between 2021 and 2031.\n\nAt the signing ceremony which took place at the State House, Alausa in the presence of the 24 issuing houses and eight trustees among others, the governor said the bond was to finance key infrastructure projects, on roads and healthcare.\n\nThese he listed to include the Lagos-Badagry Expressway, Lekki Regional Road, Rehabilitation of Ijeododo road and Rehabilitation of the alternative route to Admiralty Circle Toll Plaza.\n\n\u201cIn the last eight months, and with the unwavering support of our transaction advisers, we have been able to achieve this laudable feat \u2014 which to some observers had seemed impossible.\n\n\u201cWe set out to raise up to N125 billion and closed the Book Build with bids totalling N137.3 billion. This strong response from the investing community \u2013 to our administration\u2019s debut bond issuance \u2013 is humbling and is indeed a testament to continued investor confidence in the state\u2019s ability to deliver on its infrastructural and socio-economic developmental objectives; and to meet repayment obligations.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the significantly over-subscribed book, and active participation from a wide array of institutional investors \u2013 including banks, pension fund administrators, asset managers and corporates, Lagos State has maintained its discipline on size and pricing. Mindful of the prevailing yield environment, the Series IV Issuance was maintained at N137.3 Billion and cleared at a coupon of 13 per cent per annum. Only bids within the clearing bid were accepted,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe issuing houses were led by Managing Director Chapel Hill, Denam, Kemi Awodehin.\n\nSanwo-Olu added: \u201cIt gives me great pleasure to preside over this ceremony and to welcome you all, as Lagos State once again celebrates another milestone in the Nigerian domestic debt capital markets, with the issuance of the largest bond ever by a sub-national in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThis was also be the third time a sub-national would be issuing a long-date Bond (10 years), following the debut issuance of a 10-year instrument in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered here for the signing of the necessary documents required by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) to finalise the issuance of Lagos State\u2019s N137.3 billion 13 per cent 2021/2031 Fixed Rate Bond Series IV Bond Issuance, under the N500 billion fourth debt issuance programme.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion of this process will bring to N377.715 billion the total value of bond issued from the Lagos State N500 billion debt issuance programme.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I formally received my mandate in May 2019, the imperative to drive our THEMES agenda aggressively has been clear. In order to adequately kick-start the funding of our projects, we formally commenced this issuance process in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn line with the state\u2019s vision to build a Greater Lagos, the proceeds of the Bond will be used to finance key infrastructure projects, primarily in roads and healthcare. These include the Lekki Regional Road, Rehabilitation of Ijeododo road and Rehabilitation of the alternative route to Admiralty Circle Toll Plaza.\n\n\u201cThese projects will contribute to a better quality of living for our people, while also creating a more enabling environment for commercial and economic activity. There is no doubt \u2014 and we have seen this from previous interventions \u2014 that the multiplier social and economic effects will more than justify the cost of the investment.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Federal Ministry of Finance, PenCom and the Debt Management Office Nigeria, for their support and collaboration. Our appreciation also goes to the Securities & Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cWe equally thank the investing community for their sustained support of Lagos State and our efforts to improve the social and economic welfare of all residents in Lagos. We do not take for granted your enthusiastic response to our Bond offer.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to uphold our commitment to remain the most responsible issuer in the Nigerian capital market.\u201d\n\nIn another development, Sanwo-Olu yesterday inaugurated nine network of roads and a bridge expected to cater for 300,000 people in the Kosofe area of the state.\n\nWith a total length of 2.840km, the roads are to improve connectivity in the Kosofe area of Lagos mainland.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cToday bears testimony to the fulfilment of our administration\u2019s promise to ensure continuity of governance by completing projects that were inherited from the previous administration, especially those that are directly beneficial to the well-being of our people.\n\n\u201cIn addition to initiating new projects, we have expended huge resources on the completion of several projects which cut across different sectors in all parts of the state.\n\n\u201cSoluyi Community is a strategic settlement with a fast growing population in need of infrastructural renewal. This prompted our decision to prioritize the completion of this network of roads, with a total length of 2.840km, including a bridge, which will serve a population of more than 300,000 people, within the Soluyi-Araromi-Ifako-Gbagada Communities.\n\n\u201cThese projects exist as a testament to our administration\u2019s resolve to continue to provide the necessary infrastructure for sustainable development, in every part of the state.\n\n\u201cWith the completion of these projects, our administration has once again demonstrated the topmost priority that we accord to the welfare and well-being of the people of Lagos, in line with our Greater Lagos Vision, and the Traffic Management and Transportation Pillar of our THEMES Governing Agenda.\n\n\u201cThe ever-increasing number of people living in Lagos, and the attendant rise in vehicular traffic volumes and axle loads are partly responsible for the issues we face regarding road infrastructure in the State. Our administration will continue to respond to this challenge by stepping up our efforts in the area of construction and rehabilitation of roads and highways, and the expansion of our transportation network, with renewed focus on our multimodal transport strategy.\n\n\u201cWe can and will take some pressure off our roads by utilizing our waterways and by rail technology. This is why we are pushing ahead with determination on the Lagos Light Rail project, as well as the construction of jetties and deployment of boats and ferries across the State.\n\n\u201cI want to implore the Community Development Association of this area to immediately assume ownership of and responsibility for the judicious use of these projects/roads. You must care for them with devotion and dedication, and keep them clean, and the drainage free of waste, at all times.\u201d\n\nThe Governor highlighted some of the benefits of the roads to include as an alternative route to the Third Mainland Bridge (TMB) and Apapa-Oworonsoki Expressway via the Third Axial underpass; to address the perennial environmental and infrastructural challenges among others.\n\nWelcoming the audience, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Infrastructure, Engr Aramide Adeyoye said, \u201cFor us, the driving force behind this is to ensure connectivity and reduce the burden and pressure on major arterial roads that link to an integrated intermodal transport system which in turn opens up the local economy.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, prior to the project inception, the only access in and out of Soluyi Community, Gbagada, was via the ever- busy Ayodele Okeowo Road abutting Deeper Christian Life Bible Church.\n\n\u201cThe attendant traffic gridlock arising from high vehicular volume during peak periods necessitated the provision of an alternative route to ameliorate the discomfort, residents around the area experience while also addressing environmental challenges, particularly flooding due to inadequate drainage system.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria has recorded 500% rise in infection\n\n\u2022FCTA announces surge in new virus cases\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo and\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has launched its yuletide season campaign with the theme: #CelebrateResponsibly as part of measures to reduce spread of the COVID-19 during the yuletide.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, Nigeria has recorded a 500 per cent increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over the past two weeks across the country due to the Delta and Omicron variants.\n\nA statement by the centre yesterday said the campaign tagged, \u201c#TakeResponsibility campaign\u201d first began in February, 2020\n\nIt focuses specifically on measures Nigerians needed to take to protect themselves and loved ones from COVID-19 during this period.\n\nThe NCDC said the campaign was targeting the entertainment industry, transport industry, religious settings, media, security personnel, young people, and the general public to promote adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures during this festive period.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cAs of 19th December 2021, a total of 223,887 cases and 2985 deaths have been recorded in Nigeria across all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe country is now in a fourth COVID-19 wave.\n\n\u201cThe federal government through the Presidential Steering\n\nCommittee on COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Health, as well as NCDC and its partners, are therefore intensifying risk communication efforts to remind Nigerians of the risk we face and need to take collective responsibility to reduce transmission of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe NCDC said the response to COVID-19 required a whole-of-society approach.\n\n\u201cTherefore, individuals, families and institutions also need to play their part in protecting each other by ensuring adherence to COVID-19 public health and social measures.\n\n\u201cCritically, Nigerians are urged to adhere to recommended measures by NCDC and other public health authorities, as they celebrate Christmas and New Year,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Centre advised Nigerians to avoid all non-essential travel within and outside Nigeria to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nIn a related development, the FCT Administration has disclosed that it had detected almost 3,000 new cases of COVID-19, indicating the escalation in the spread of the virus which is now in its fourth wave in the country.\n\nThe Secretary of FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS), Dr. Abubakar Tafida, raised the alarm yesterday at a media briefing where he provided insights on the spread of the pandemic in the territory.\n\nHe pleaded with residents of the Federal Capital Territory to minimise physical contacts and other non-pharmaceutical measures to control the spread of the virus.\n\nIn addition, he urged members of the public to maintain social distancing, wear facemasks and wash their hands with soap or hand sanitisers to prevent the escalation of the pandemic.\n\nHe said the secretariat had resolved three weeks ago that the Territory had lapsed into the forth wave of the pandemic following an exponential rise in the number of new cases.\n\nTafida said the health authority confirmed 84 new cases on Sunday to bring the cumulative cases in the FCT to 24,861 since the first wave out of which 224 deaths were recorded.\n\n\u201cNow we have 1,246 active cases. We also noted additional 13 cases in the past 24 hours. In terms of people or cases on admission, we have a total of 105. Of this number, 92 are in THISDAY Dome and13 at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada.\n\nThis, he said signified the severity of the conditions, saying preparedness was key to effectively handling the pandemic.\n\n\u201cSo you can see that within the span of three weeks, we are having almost a thousand plus, so if we continue to neglect these preventive measures, the situation might become very alarming and difficult to handle,\u201d he warned.\n\nHe added that at the last meeting they had evaluated the current situation as well as the increasing number of cases, the Health Secretariat developed strategies that were in consonance with scientific and other available data.\n\nHe implored all stakeholders, including security, traditional, religious leaders, people of note, to ensure that they are supporting the effort, by imploring and advising people to continue to observe these measures.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we are all aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of global upheaval, as there were lots of agitations, destructions , death and socioeconomic hardships.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the vaccine apathy even though there were over 320 teams working within the FCT providing vaccination.\n\nHe warned that in view of the attitude the authority might be compelled to enforce the national vaccination mandate in the territory.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A leaked audio of an operative of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mohammed Idris, has revealed how the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, compromised cases of corruption in the country.\n\nMalami had recommended the appointment of the current EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, to President Muhammadu Buhari in February this year.\n\nMalami\n\nIn one of the multiple audio recordings obtained by Daily Nigerian and verified by some insiders, the EFCC operative was discussing with one Abdulbari Yusuf, a younger brother to a retired Rear Admiral and former director of Navy Accounts, Tahir Yusuf, who was facing charges of corruption.\n\nIdris, who is a lawyer, was also heard giving Yusuf\u2019s brother hints on how to defeat the anti-graft commission at the Court of Appeal as well as ways to evacuate money from a particular account.\n\n\u201cIf he has money in any account linked with his BVN (Bank Verification Number), he should quickly evacuate them. And if he makes transfers, EFCC will still trace it. He should only withdraw and then deposit into another account,\u201d he said.\n\nYusuf had also specifically mentioned Malami as the one in charge of the EFCC, and the minister had ordered the unfreezing of \u201cbig accounts\u201d investigated by the commission.\n\n\u201cMalami now controls the EFCC. The commission is in his hands. Once Malami speaks, the account will be unfrozen.

And if he makes transfers, EFCC will still trace it. He should only withdraw and then deposit into another account,\u201d he said.\n\nYusuf had also specifically mentioned Malami as the one in charge of the EFCC, and the minister had ordered the unfreezing of \u201cbig accounts\u201d investigated by the commission.\n\n\u201cMalami now controls the EFCC.

It has also become necessary that we show such restraint because of the presence of moles who have infiltrated and literally taken over the social media space.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said these in an update on his visit to Kanu on Monday, which was made available to SaharaReporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWe paid our routine visit to our untiring, unwavering, unrelenting, rock-solid and noble client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yesterday, at the DSS detention facility at Abuja. The visit, this time, was spectacular and was greeted by an infectious air of camaraderie. Onyendu was particularly enthused by the visit and preferred to describe it as 'A SURPRISE CHRISTMAS PRESENT'.\n\n\u201cYou may not understand the peculiarity of this visit and how significant it is. But in due course, I am certain you will be in the best position to fully appreciate the wisdom that informed it. Suffice it to say that as the lead attorney of Onyendu, I took advantage of the visit to unveil a legal giant, a distinguished and an accomplished member of the Inner Bar, whom I have chosen to fortify our defence team.\n\n\u201cThe learned Senior counsel is an excellent and a consummate learned gentleman, distinguished in academics and in the practice of law in our law courts. The reason that informed this arrangement is my unflinching desire to throw in every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that Onyendu gets the BEST at all times.\n\n\u201cThis latest masterstroke, evident in the legal giant that has intervened, came to Onyendu as a big surprise. Although he was not oblivious of my arrangement to enlist the assistance and co-operation of a Senior attorney, he did not know that I could get a Senior attorney of the rarest breed. He was particularly delighted to welcome this legal giant, a consummate member of the Inner Bar, a legal Iroko, who has distinguished himself in the practice of law when we visited him yesterday.\n\n\u201cI must state here and now that the Senior attorney involved has been my mentor over the years. He has worked from the sidelines with our legal team since 2016. He is a man imbued with profound intellect, legal sophistry, an infectious sense of history, much like Onyendu, and of impeccable character. His brilliance radiates effortlessly. He is indeed an excellent advocate.\n\n\u201cThe stage which we have attained in the court gymnastics involving Onyendu signposts an auspicious time at which to introduce the leading and erudite member of the Inner Bar to our defence team.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, he will lead our defence team in proceedings in court.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting yesterday, we deliberated extensively on other issues. But such deliberations, for tactical reasons, are to remain private for now. I want to assure you, UMUCHINEKE, that our legal team, is, presently, more fortified than ever to do battle in court, and God being on our side, victory is assured,\u201d the statement said further.\n\n\u201cI must hasten to declare to you that we are not relenting in our firm resolve to secure the release of other members who have been unjustly and unlawfully incarcerated in the various detention facilities of Nigeria's security agencies all over the country.\n\n\u201cSome of those persons include Ada Nsukka, Idara, and others, who were recently abducted by lawless and overzealous agents of the state. I assure you that in due course we will effectively utilise the instrumentality of the law to set them at liberty.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that we do not publicise our legal interventions in the social media space does not mean that we are not taking concrete and effective steps to secure the release of all those unjustly detained.

The case has been in court over the custody of their daughter.\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Saheed stood before the court and requested a DNA test of their daughter to determine paternity before carrying on with proceedings.\n\nIt was also reported that the actress and her lawyer agreed to the request on the condition that Saheed would fund it and that the court would ensure supervision.\n\nAccording to reports, since that day, Saheed disappeared into thin air, thereby, delaying the court process.\n\nThe court, therefore, issued a bench warrant on October 13, 2021, which he ignored.\n\nOn the last court date early December 2021, he was declared wanted by the court.\n\nThe enrolment of order reads, \u201cUpon this cause, coming up before this, Honourable Court today the 15th day of December 2021.\n\n\u201cAnd pursuant to the Oral Application of the Applicant's Counsel in the open Court made on the 15th December 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby ordered as follows: That this Honourable Court hereby ordered that the Respondent (Saheed Olarenwaju Aranmolate) whose whereabout (sic) is unknown and making it difficult to execute the order of Court be declared as a wanted person. Where ever he may be.\u201d\n\nThe actress had been discreet about the recent happenings in her relationship and had deleted photos of her baby daddy on her Instagram page.\n\nRonke, who reportedly dated Fuji maestro, Pasuma, had once stated that her child's father was Jago in an Instagram post in 2019.\n\nDiverse reactions have continued to trail the recent development, with many offering support for the 47-year-old actress.\n\nDOCUMENTS: Court Declares Nigerian Actress, Ronke Odusanya's Baby Daddy Wanted by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

Governors\u2019 concern is that opportunities are given for an inclusive process. And I think that is what Mr. President\u2019s letter has brought out.\n\n\u201cMr. President has not objected to direct primaries, neither has he endorsed indirect primaries. He has only said \u2018be fair to all; let all options apply and what you decide should be determined by your own local and peculiar circumstances\u2019.

It was an indirect primary.\n\n\u201cBut in 2019, when he was coming back, he came back via direct primary. So, Mr. President has also tasted both. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s somebody to be lectured about the pros and cons of either process.\u201d\n\nThe governor said what is important is to ensure that whatever mode of primary chosen \u201cprovides a process that is as free a manner as possible\u201d.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries have their own challenges; indirect primaries have their own challenges.

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time. They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

As set out above, Ogunba on behalf of Ecobank, deliberately instituted a multiplicity of actions on the same dispute, facts, grounds and between the same parties.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that it is Ecobank\u2019s intention through Ogunba to harass, embarrass and disrupt the business of the Honeywell Group.

In particular, Honeywell Flour Mills plc with an asset base of N68 billion, an annual revenue of about N55 billion and over 5,000 employees and several distributors was subject to unfair and harsh restrictions as a result of Ogunba\u2019s mischievous suits and wrongly obtained orders until the said orders were rightfully set aside by the Court of Appeal.\u201d\n\nConcluding, Honeywell said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act (CAP L11, LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nHadiza Mustapha, chief registrar of the Supreme Court and secretary of the Privileges Committee issued a statement informing the public that the committee had at an emergency on September 15, 2017, noted that the matter of the alleged misconduct levelled against Ogunba was tabled and decided.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthis is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at which the respondent (Ogunba) was given fair hearing, it was decided that the petition is meritorious. \u201cConsequently, the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at its 129th plenary meeting have withdrawn the rank of senior advocate of Nigeria from Kunle Ogunba Esq and all other privileges attached to the rank forthwith.\u201d\n\nThe story has been updated. https://businessday.ng/companies/article/lawyer-in-ecobanks-tango-with-honeywell-ogunba-got-back-rank-of-san-in-2018/",
          "summary": "On January 11, 2018, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee severely sanctioned Ogunba for professional misconduct in relation to his handling of the court cases, withdrawing from him the rank of senior advocate of Nigeria and all other privileges attached to the rank.\nAs set out above, Ogunba on behalf of Ecobank, deliberately instituted a multiplicity of actions on the same dispute, facts, grounds and between the same parties.\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\u201cIt is obvious that it is Ecobank\u2019s intention through Ogunba to harass, embarrass and disrupt the business of the Honeywell Group.\nThe damaging effect of Ecobank\u2019s numerous mischievous suits and wrongly obtained orders is enormous and cannot be quantified.\n\u201cConsequently, the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at its 129th plenary meeting have withdrawn the rank of senior advocate of Nigeria from Kunle Ogunba Esq and all other privileges attached to the rank forthwith.\u201dThe story has been updated.",

But we realized that over the years, the LGAs are neglected whereas they are very critical to the development of a state. Let us not dwell on the challenges because challenges are always there. We should dwell more on the potential. I am quite happy about the three LGAs selected for this pilot survey because in each, there are tertiary institutions, which also brings huge opportunities.\n\n\u201cIn developing economies, it starts with research. So, the potentials in these tertiary institutions in the LGAs would be utilized optimally. We need to think about the kind of partnership with the tertiary institutions in terms of research and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Governor\u2019s 2022 budget proposal, you will see that capital infrastructure is very huge, which is because of the government\u2019s zeal to fix our state. It is time to make our LGAs attractive so that even the Diaspora can come and invest at home,\u201d he added.\n\nIn her remarks, Edo State Coordinator for GIZ-SEDEN, Blessing Ajimoti, noted, \u201cWe want to get data and meet the stakeholders.

          "text": "The United States Secret Service said on Tuesday that criminals have stolen close to $100 billion in Covid-19 pandemic relief funds.\n\nThe stolen funds, the service said, were diverted by fraudsters from the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and a another program set up to dole out unemployment assistance funds nationwide.\n\nThe agency, however, said more than $2.3 billion in stolen funds have been recovered so far, resulting in the arrest of more than 100 suspects who span the spectrum from individuals to organized groups.\n\nThe government has shelled out about $3.5 trillion in Covid relief money since early 2020, when the pandemic began.\n\nThe Secret Service, which specializes in financial fraud in addition to its better-known role in presidential protection, also announced the appointment of a new national pandemic fraud recovery coordinator to oversee its sprawling investigations into the enormous number of fraud cases resulting from all that theft.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in law enforcement for over 29 years and worked some complex fraud investigations for 20 plus years, and I\u2019ve never seen something at this scale,\u201d said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Roy Dotson, who was named to the new role at the agency.\n\nDotson, in an interview with CNBC, said the ease of obtaining the funds has made it easier for criminals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the programs were easily accessible online. And so, with that, comes the opportunity for bad actors to get into that mix,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was necessary to try to get these funds out to people that were truly hurting, and no fault of anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service currently has more than 900 active investigations related to pandemic fraud, Dotson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wide range because the pot was so big,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cYou not only have your typical transnational organized groups and domestic organized groups, criminal groups, but you have individuals that decided to take advantage of that. So, there\u2019s many different patterns and investigative intelligence that we develop that I can\u2019t really go into. But we\u2019ve mapped out kind of some of the different characteristics of different groups.\u201d\n\nIn his new role, Dotson. who is based in the Jacksonville field office, is also overseeing investigations related to cryptocurrency fraud. In those cases, criminals typically persuade victims to transfer funds into crypto wallets which are used for illegal schemes or open bank accounts which are used to launder money, CNBC reported.\n\n\u201cI would say the primary difficulty is the sheer scope of the amount of fraudulent you know, loans, or unemployment insurance benefits ever distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the number of individuals that receive those, whether they were a money mule, or the actual recipient is just enormous.\u201d\n\nThe government quickly rolled out the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program last year to help small businesses. Both programs have been plagued with problems. A report from a Labor Department inspector general blamed inadequate controls for billions of dollars in potential fraud.\n\nThe fast rollout of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program made it easy prey for fraudsters. The Labor Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, in a report released in March, said that at least $89 billion of the estimated $896 billion in unemployment program funds \u201ccould be paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud.\u201d\n\nCNBC confirmed earlier this year that tech-savvy fraudsters opened accounts with at least four online investment programs, according to law enforcement officials. The digital platforms, investigators said, are easy to dump the money into by setting up accounts with stolen identities.\n\nMore than $100 million in fraudulent funds passed through investment accounts since Congress passed the CARES Act last March, according to authorities, CNBC reported.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari on sent his letter to the National Assembly to communicate his decision not to assent to the electoral act amendment bill passed by the assembly in November.\n\nSpeaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, at the opening of plenary on Tuesday, read the communication from the President on the floor of the house.\n\nGbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021.\n\nTitled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021,\u2019 the letter read:\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Iitigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\n\u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "title": "NCC sets new Mobile International Termination Rate for voice services paid by overseas telco carriers",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has determined the new International Termination Rate (ITR) for voice services paid by overseas telecom carriers for terminating international calls on local networks in Nigeria at $0.045.\n\nNCC\u2019s Director Public Affairs, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde disclosed this in a statement on Monday.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe new rate is contained in the \u2018Determination of Mobile International Termination Rate\u2019 issued by the Commission on November 25, 2021. The $0.045 rate is the floor price for ITR services and shall take effect from January 1, 2022. The rate is to be paid in US Dollar to enable Nigerian operators to receive an increasing rate in Naira terms to accommodate devaluation.\n\n\u201cNo licensee shall charge and or receive effective rate per minute below determined ITR floor rate. As such, payment discounts, volume discounts and any other concession that has the effect of bringing the effective ITR lower than the rate determined shall be deemed a contravention of the new determination and will attract sanctions in line with the Nigerian Communications (Enforcement process, etc.) Regulations, 2019.\n\n\u201cThe ITR Floor is the minimum that can be charged. Operators will be free to negotiate a rate above the floor and this will be entirely left to commercial negotiation between the operators and international carriers/partners.\n\n\u201cHowever, while the ITR only pertains to the cost of bringing traffic into Nigeria, Nigerian operators will continue to pay the regulated Mobile Termination Rate (MTR), the local termination rate among themselves.\n\n\u201cThe MTR of N3.90 for generic 2G/3G/4G operators and N4.70 for new entrant Long Term Evolution (LTE) operators determined in 2018, will continue to apply for local call terminations until a new rate is determined by the Commission pursuant to its powers as enshrined in the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003.\n\n\u201cThe subsisting regime of interconnection rates was sustained by the Commission\u2019s Mobile (voice) termination rate issued on June 1, 2018. In the determination, it was stated that the ITR of N24.40 determined in 2016 will continue to apply until a new determination is made.\n\n\u201cThe ITR, being denominated in Naira had multiple negative impacts on local operators which was further exacerbated by episodes of devaluation of naira which ultimately left Nigeria from being a net receiver with respect to international minutes to a net payer.\n\n\u201cThe Commission also observed that operators continue to face series of challenges occasioned by the denomination of ITR in Naira, necessitating a need for a cost-based study on ITR. In view of the foregoing and in fulfillment of its statutory mandate of periodic review of regulatory policies, the Commission engaged Messrs\u2019 Payday Advance and Support Services Limited to undertake a cost-based study of voice MTR that is most suitable for the Nigerian telecommunications industry.\n\n\u201cCommenting, the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said in arriving at the new MTR of $0.045, \u201cThe Commission has carefully considered the information provided by stakeholders and taken a view on parameters and regulatory measures in the light of relevant information such as international experience, cost model results, the state of competition in the sector and the Nigerian macro-economic environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe added that the process of arriving at the ITR had been conducted transparently with a view to providing maximum clarity to all parties without compromising the confidentiality of commercially-sensitive information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the result the review will make a significant contribution to the development of the telecoms sector in Nigeria and be beneficial to subscribers, operators and the country at large,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe EVC, on behalf of the Board and Management of the NCC, extended the Commission\u2019s gratitude to all operators and industry stakeholders, who submitted information relating to the regulation of interconnection rates and the costing models as well as the consultant, for their participation in the process leading to the Determination.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), on Tuesday handed over a symbolic cheque of N621.24 billion for the rehabilitation of 21 critical roads across the country through the Tax Credit Scheme under the Executive Order 7 signed by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019.\n\nIn his remarks before the brief presentation ceremony at the Conference Room of the Ministry of Works and Housing, Minister, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, SAN, explained that the Tax Credit Scheme, which, according to him, was inherited from the previous administration, was meant as a strategic partnership with the Private Sector.\n\nThe Minister, who said the present administration was currently using it for the construction and rehabilitation of Kabba-Obajana Road in Kogi State and the Apapa-Oworonsoki Road in Lagos, pointed out that contrary to the belief in some quarters that the Scheme was meant for only big companies like the Dangote Group, the scheme was open to all the members of the Private Sector.\n\n\u201cThe Tax Credit Scheme is a policy that we inherited from the previous administration. It was there but it was never used\u201d, Fashola said, adding that it was in the life of the present administration that the scheme was given life and because it had an expiration date the Executive Order 7 had to be put in place to enable government use it to address the Kabba-Obajana, and \u201cthe difficult Apapa-Oworonsoki Roads which is serving the Apapa Port\u201d.\n\nThe Minister explained further, \u201cOf course, the Tax Credit Scheme that we inherited had an expiry date and when we started using it, it was being said that it was made for one company alone. So we had to come out to explain that it was meant for all the companies that have tax credit\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd when it expired, we looked at some of the limitations of the scheme and we made some recommendations to the President\u201d, the Minister said, adding that one of the recommendations was that, perhaps, the roads should be made more diverse and to be spread out to include all the six geopolitical zones.\n\nAccording to him, another recommendation was that other companies that have smaller turnover could come together to form conglomerates.\n\nHe added, \u201cAll of these were then factored into the recommendations that were passed to the President which was signed as the Executive Order 7\u201d.\n\nDescribing the signing of the cheque as \u201ca big show of confidence by the NNPC\u201d, Fashola expressed delight that contrary to the earlier impression created in some quarters, the scheme was now attracting other sectors of the economy including the manufacturing and telecommunications firms.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC and Chief Finance Officer of the organization, Mr. Umar Ajiya, said the Corporation was motivated by the challenged condition of some of the nation\u2019s roads most of which were the arteries of the company\u2019s operations adding that with the vandalization of the distribution pipelines the company had been forced to use the roads as its channel of distribution of petroleum products nationwide.\n\nThanking the Minister of Works and Housing and other relevant agencies of government, the NNPC Chief Finance Officer said the symbolic presentation of the N621 billion was a way of contributing to the Federal Government efforts to give Nigerians befitting road network adding that it was an investment that was being done in compliance to the Executive Order 7 to use the company\u2019s tax credit.\n\nThe Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service, Mr. Muhammad Nami said the investment in roads was as a result of Executive Order 007, 2019 meant to encourage taxpayers to use company income tax payable by them to fix the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure in exchange for tax credit.\n\nThe critical roads, which are major routes for the distribution of petroleum products across the country by the NNPC include, the roads in the North Central totaling 791kilometres which are the dualization of Ilorin-Jebba-Mokwa/Bokani Junction Road Section I: Ilorin-Jebba In Kwara State, dualization of Ilorin-Jebba-Mokwa/Bokani Junction Road Section II: Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani Junction In Kwara/Niger States and dualization of Suleja-Minna Road in Niger State.\n\nAlso in the zone are the dualization of Suleja-Minna Road in Niger State Phase II, Reconstruction of Bida-Lambata Road in Niger State, Agaie \u2013 Katcha \u2013 Baro Road, Emergency Repairs of failed section of Mokwa \u2013 Makera \u2013 Tegina \u2013 Kaduna State Border in Niger State, Minna \u2013 Zungeru \u2013 Tegina road and Bida \u2013 Minna Road.\n\nIn the South-South, three roads totaling 81.90 kilometres which are under the scheme include rehabilitation of Odukpani-Itu-Ikot Ekpene Road in Cross River State Section I: Odukpani-Itu Bridge Head in Cross River/Akwa Ibom States, dualization of outstanding portion of Odukpani-ltu-lkot Ekpene, and dualization of Oku-Iboku Power Plant Section of the Odukpani-Itu-Ikot-Ekpene Road in Cross River/Akwa Ibom States.\n\nThe roads chosen in the South East, aggregating to122 kilometres, include rehabilitation of Umuahia (Ikwuano)-Ikot Ekpene Road: Umuahia-Umudike in Abia State and the dualization of Aba-Ikot Ekpene Road in Abia/Akwa Ibom States.\n\nIn the North East, roads involved total 117 kilometres. They include rehabilitation of Cham-Numan Section of Gombe-Yola Road in Adamawa State, construction of Bali \u2013 Serti Road in Taraba State and rehabilitation of Gombe \u2013 Biu Road in Gombe/Borno State while in the North West the roads chosen, which aggregate to 283.5kilometres, include Rehabilitation of Outstanding Sections of Gada \u2013 Zaima \u2013 Zuru \u2013 Gamji Road Phase II in Kebbi State and Rehabilitation of Zaria-Funtua-Gusau-Sokoto-Birnin Kebbi.\n\nIn the South West, roads chosen are rehabilitation and expansion of Lagos-Badagry Expressway (Agbara Junction-Nigeria/Benin Border) in Lagos State and the dualization of Ibadan \u2013 Ilorin Road (Route A2) Section II in Oyo State (Oyo \u2013 Ogbomosho) which aggregate to 114.00 kilometres.",

          "title": "Crypto Giant FTX, Reaches Out To Pre-Tertiary Institutions of Learning",
          "text": "Africa\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has been in the news on a regular for some time now; all as a result of churning out one innovative idea or the other. While many will attribute this to marketing tactics, a little known aspect of the company is its charity stance. One of its mantra is that the company was founded with the goal of having the largest possible positive impact on the world.\n\nIn reality, the FTX Africa team is living up to this goal. Just recently, FTX launched an educational charity outreach in Nigeria. The outreach event started as a series of school visitation as well as intervention across the country to both primary and secondary institutions of learning. FTX hopes to help create a conducive environment for learning while also emphasising the need for pupils to value education.\n\nAccording to the Business Development Manager for FTX in Africa, Adebayo Juwon, \u201cWe are strong believers in education, and we have been actively collaborating and engaging in dialogue with players in the ecosystem.\u201d Hence, the company is taking a stronger approach to further affirm its willingness to uphold its mantra as a platform for the people by fulfilling its corporate social responsibility.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchange giant is leveraging on this to help provide services beneficial to a number of formative educational institutions. Some of the beneficiary schools so far include; Aguda Junior Secondary school, Makoko floating school, Alimosho Junior Grammer School, Istrina School in Ajegunle, Tomvic School in Mushin as well as Alagbado Junior Grammer school.\n\nIn all the schools visited so far, the FTX team has been able to donate writing and learning materials such as books, boards, textbooks, fans, mathematical sets, calculators as well as sitting facilities among others to the pupils as well as staffs present in such schools. In the comming months, this outreach is expected to spread to other parts of Nigeria; thereby touching more lives and improving on the quality of education delivered.\n\nFTX.COM is a cryptocurrency exchange built for traders as an intuitive yet powerful platform for all users. The platform also strives to be the most innovative exchange in the industry and has seen a positive growth since it debuted two years ago. Asides its educational outreach, FTX also runs a crypto tour aimed at educating both seasoned experts as well as interested newbies on the opportunities available in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIn the last few months alone, FTX has impacted knowledge on over 1500 individuals across the country and now is taking the charge to secondary schools. No doubt, the company is expected to roll out more innovative ideas in the coming months as a means of living up to its vision.",

          "title": "Dumped Electoral Act Amendment Bill: Fayemi backs Buhari as senators move to override veto",
          "text": "Strong indication emerged Tuesday that the Senate may override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal of assent to the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 at plenary Wednesday.\n\nAt the expiration of the time frame for him to append his signature to the Bill, Buhari wrote the National Assembly of his decision not to sign the document into law, citing a number of reasons.\n\nIn a letter forwarded to the Senate and read during plenary, the president cited series of reasons bordering on security, economy, finance and existing constitutional provisions of political parties for refusing assent to the bill.\n\nThe reasons were advanced in respect of the contentious area in the Bill-the recommended mandatory direct primary for all political parties in picking their candidates for general elections.\n\nLeading the move, Senator George Sekibo (PDP Rivers East), called for a closed door session in the mid of the plenary which lasted 40 minutes.\n\nBut no categorical decision was taken thereafter by the Senate which hurriedly adjourned to Wednesday.\n\nExpressing his anger to journalists after the plenary, Sekibo said, about 73 signatures of aggrieved senators had been collected and that there was no going back on the decision to override Buhari\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cBy law, we have the power to override him. That\u2019s what section 58 (4 & 5) said. We will use our powers to do it. And they are saying that people must be present at voting.\n\n\u201cOur rule gives us three methods of voting- voice vote, by signing the document (signature) and electronic voting. So we can use anyone.\n\n\u201cWe have already collected signatures totalling about 73 now in and outside the chamber and it cuts across party lines,\u201d he said.\n\nConfirming the move in a separate interview, Senator Matthew Urhoghide (PDP Edo South) said the Senate, and by extension the National Assembly, must extricate itself from public odium slammed on it as rubber stamp by overriding the veto .\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must be reminded that members of the National Assembly are truly the representatives of the people because every Federal Constituency and Senatorial District seat is allocated to a segment of the Nigerian people who are their constituents.\n\n\u201cThe members of the National Assembly consulted with a cross section of their constituents to reach an informed position on any matter of national interest and development.\n\n\u201cThe issue of direct primaries in our electoral process has been well canvassed, elucidated, and argued by both chambers of the NASS, and inputs were taken at public hearing from across the spectrum of all critical stakeholders.\n\n\u201cBoth chambers passed the bill with some little variations in some sections which consequently necessitated the setting up of a conference committee of five members each from both chambers. At the end of all the deliberations, direct primary was agreed upon.\n\n\u201cThe time has come when only popular candidates within the party should be thrown up for general elections. General elections in this way will become easier and less cumbersome for parties to win since they have truly popular candidates.\n\n\u201cAs we speak today, the whole world has become a global village. Nigeria should endeavour to revolutionise its electoral system to avert bickering and unnecessary disputation that come with nominations or party primaries.\n\n\u201cIn Chile, Gabriel Boric, a thirty five-year old former student activist has won the run off in the presidential election because he was truly popular and supported by the people.\n\n\u201cLess than two hours into counting of the ballots, his much older opponent congratulated him and urged all his compatriots to support his incoming government.\n\n\u201cNigeria must take a queue by allowing genuine inclusiveness, particularly our young people who are in excess of sixty percent of our population. All the devious designs to exclude them will not help us.\n\n\u201cI urge my colleagues in the National Assembly to do the needful by overriding the veto and make the bill law. This is not the first time it is happening in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRecalling a similar scenario, the lawmaker said: \u201cThe NDDC Bill of 2001 was vetoed by NASS under Obasanjo, who was a PDP president. The NASS should extricate itself from public odium and disrespect by going ahead to override President Buhari who is APC. History stares NASS in the face if indeed it is not a rubber stamp.\u201d\n\nMany other Senators who pleaded anonymity strongly expressed their readiness to override President Buhari on the rejected bill.\n\nFayemi excited\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti state Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has expressed support for the president\u2019s decision.\n\nFayemi spoke Tuesday while addressing journalists after his visit to the president at the State House, Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMr. President has not objected to direct primaries, neither has he endorsed indirect primaries, he has only said, be fair to all, let all options apply and what you decide should be determined by your own local and peculiar circumstances; being mindful of questions of security, finances, and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we all should commend the courage of Mr. President to stand with the people.\u201d\n\nAdegboruwa faults Buhari\n\nBut in another reaction, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has accused President Buhari of sabotaging efforts to ensure electoral reforms for the benefit of the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nAdegboruwa said this in a statement issued Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by Blueprint.\n\nThe SAN asked the National Assembly to invoke the provisions of section 58(5) of the Constitution to pass the Bill into law, through the two-thirds majority of both chambers.\n\nThe silk said by declining assent to the bill, the president did not properly exercise his discretion in the national interest.\n\nAdegboruwa said: \u201cWhat this means is that the president prefers to retain all the manifest flaws bedeviling our electoral system from which himself and his ruling party are benefiting to the detriment of our democratic advancement.\n\n\u201cAlthough the President is entitled to the discretion of his assent to any bill presented to him, however, the reason adduced for the exercise of such presidential discretion must be legal and valid.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the discretion has not been properly exercised in the national interest, in this particular case.\u201d\n\nCSOs\n\nAlso, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have expressed concern over the non-assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by the president.\n\nThey said the decision would have serious implication on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the body prepares for the FCT Area Council election, the Ekiti/Osun governorship elections, and ultimately the 2023 General Elections.\n\nThe CSOs stated this Tuesday in a joint statement by Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD),The Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS),Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF) and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nWithholding of assent by the president to a bill relevant electoral stakeholders spent quality time putting together, they said, undermines public confidence and trust in the electoral system.\n\nThe bodies also said it was even more disappointing that Buhari \u201cdelayed his response until the efflux ion of time required for assenting to legislation until the date that the National Assembly is proceeding for the Christmas and New Year holiday.\u201d\n\nThey further said \u201cthe non-conclusion of the electoral amendment process will mean that these elections will be conducted using the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) denying INEC the opportunity to test the efficacy of some of the new innovations introduced in the proposed Electoral Bill 2021.\u201d\n\nThe bodies also noted that \u201cthis is apart from the delay the commission will have to contend with in the required effort to review its guidelines, regulations and manuals in accordance with certain provisions of the Bill.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFurthermore, based on the revised timelines for specific electoral activities in the Bill, INEC and other stakeholders will have to grapple with logistical, financial, and programmatic difficulties in the run-up to the 2023 General Election. We reckon that this may not bode well for Nigeria\u2019s electoral democracy, hence the clamor for the speedy conclusion of the electoral reform process.\n\n\u201cTo avert further complications and logjam in the efforts to strengthen the electoral process, we strongly recommend as follows:The National Assembly as a matter of national emergency should either override the President\u2019s decision or remove the contentious clause (s) from the Bill and transmit the Bill back to the President for assent within the next 30 days.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should ensure that all clerical, editorial, and cross-referencing gaps in the current Bill are resolved before transference back to the President.\n\n\u201cThe president should expeditiously assent to the revised Bill upon receipt from the National Assembly and the Civil society groups, media, and development partners must sustain the effort to protect the will of the people and safeguard the electoral reform process from policy capture and manipulation.\u201d",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai has said there is nothing like repentant bandits.\n\nHe also said his administration\u2019s policy is to dispatch the terrorists attacking innocent people to their creator to answer for their crimes against humanity.\n\nThe governor said this Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja.\n\nAnswering a question on his stance on repentant bandits, the governor said: \u201cThere is nothing like repentant terrorists. The only repentant bandit is the one that is dead. Our intention in the state is to kill them (terrorists), let them go and see God.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai, who was accompanied by Commissioner for Internal Security Samuel Aruwan, said the whereabouts of the bandits were not hidden but that the military was mindful of the collateral damage it could cause the civilian community.\n\n\u201cIf the security forces cannot go to the bandits\u2019 location, the state was helpless,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said he asked for the intervention of the president for more deployment of security forces and a comprehensive operation.\n\nThe governor charged the security agencies to carry out aggressive operations against the terrorists, even as he stressed the need for recruitment to be ramped up in the military and the police as the few number cannot successfully carry out operations in the 36 states of the federation.\n\nHe listed there categories of those behind the nation\u2019s insecurity to include the Boko Haram elements, the bandits, and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), noting that the recent declaration of bandits as terrorists by the court had given the military more power to wage war against them.\n\nNorthern youth\n\nIn a related development, the Northern youth under the aegis of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), have staged a peaceful demonstration in Zaria, Kaduna state, to protest the incessant killings and kidnap for ransom by bandits, especially in the north western part of the country.\n\nBlueprint reports the protesters in their hundreds converged on Kwangila and trekked to PZ area in Sabon Gari local government area of the state.\n\nThey carried placards with different inscriptions like \u201cZaria Peace Walk Against Security, \u201cEnd insecurity, \u201cNorth is bleeding\u201d and \u201csecure north\u201d chanting various songs.\n\nAddressing journalists on their mission CNG Deputy Coordinator in-charge of North-west, Comrade Sani Saed Al-Tukry, said the whole of the north was bleeding as nowhere was safe.\n\nCiting Zaria-Kaduna road which was strategic gateway to many states across the country, he said it had become the epicentre of terrorism.\n\nAl-Tukry said no day passes by without one unpalatable incident of kidnapping of innocent citizens with reckless abandon, saying \u201cit has been a tale of blood, tears and gnashing of teeth which must not be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nThey urged the federal government to order security agencies to mount and sustain special operations on all roads, particularly Zaria-Kaduna, Kaduna-Abuja, Kaduna-Birnin Gwari-Niger, Birnin Gwari-Funtua-Katsina-Zanfara-Sokoto.\n\nHe further stated that the terrorists\u2019 enclave must be dismantled and murderous elements eliminated or arrested to face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must carry out special operation in Northern Nigeria to destroy terrorists\u2019 enclave. The North today is like a sinking ship that is about to capsize. There is need for unified stance guided by an agreed national interest irrespective of political, religious and ethnic affiliation.\n\n\u201cThe national security architecture should significantly improve Nigeria\u2019s chances of mitigating the spate of violence or terrorism across the country so that together we can join hands to build a nation where peace and justice shall reign,\u201d the youth further said.\n\nAPC tackles PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has carpeted the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for its \u201cinsensitive and below the belt suggestions\u201d of bandits and kidnappers\u2019 activities across the country.\n\nSpecifically, the APC accused the opposition of politicising insecurity.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday in Abuja and signed by its national secretary, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, the APC described PDP\u2019s comments as \u201cheinous and callous.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe bemoaned the attempt to convert teary circumstances to politically motivated ones, stressing such an act by the PDP amounts to \u201cthrowing caution to the wind instead of showing sympathy for the people who were affected by such tragedy.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cSuggestions by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the President Muhammadu Buhari government is insensitive to the heinous activities of bandits in parts of the country should be seen for what it is \u2014 politically motivated, callous and insensitive to victims and our gallant troops battling to end their criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThe regrettable attempt to turn a tragic situation into an object of politicking crosses the line of political decorum. True to form, the PDP continues to expose its desperate politics in which all is fair, including unguarded statements mocking the travails of citizens and efforts of security services to score political points.\n\n\u201cThe PDP playing politics with the evil activities of bandits, insurgents and other criminal rings which had their roots in PDP\u2019s shabby handling of their criminal activities during their formative stages, has exposed PDP as unpatriotic, banal and a wobbling opposition\u201d, he said.\n\nContinuing, the party scribe said: \u201cWhile the PDP wallows in its delusions to score cheap points, the President Buhari-led APC administration has strengthened our security services, particularly the Armed Forces through military procurement and strategic training which has led to great successes against insurgents, bandits and kidnappers.\n\n\u201cThis includes the dispatch of high-level security/assessment delegations and delivery of relief items to affected citizens by the National Disaster Management Agency (NEMA).\n\n\u201cA case in point is the recent bandit attack in Sokoto State. Hours after the visit to the state by the federal delegation, our gallant Armed Forces, elements of the Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police Force operations which neutralised dozens of the bandits and kidnappers, restoring calm in the affected area and the government of Sokoto state commendation of the federal government\u2019s prompt deployment of elite troops who smoked out the bandits and eliminated many of them.\n\n\u201cThe APC assures Nigerians that President Buhari has not and will never relent in ensuring normalcy in all parts of the country.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\nAhead of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) February 12th 2022, area council elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disclosed that the Permanent Voter Cards for eligible Nigerians who registered in the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, would be ready for distribution from January 6th \u2013 4th February, 2022.\n\nChairman of the Commission, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the disclosure on Tuesday at the INEC headquarters, during a meeting with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs).\n\nHe disclosed that 39,208 new PVCs were be printed arising from the CVR exercise in the FCT.\n\nProf. Yakubu explained that \u201ca total of 42,986 Nigerians completed their registration in the FCT, adding that \u201cThe Commission has diligently cleaned up the data using our new Automatic Biometric Identification System (ABIS) to weed out multiple registrations.\n\n\u201cAs a testimony to the efficacy of our ABIS process,14,665 (34.1%) multiple registrations were detected and rejected. Consequently, the number of new valid registrants in the FCT is 28,321.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdded to this figure are requests for transfer of registrations to FCT, replacement of lost or damaged PVCs and update of voter records, making an overall total of 39,208 new PVCs to be printed, he said.\n\nCommenting on the CVR across the country, the INEC chairman said \u201cwe have now completed the second quarter of the exercise which commenced online in June and physically at designated centres in July.\n\n\u201cWe have also been giving Nigerians weekly updates for the last six months. The 3rd quarter of the exercise will commence in January next year\u201d.\n\nHe said that the exercise might be cascaded to the ward level soon to encourage more Nigerian\u2019s to register.\n\nAccording to Professor Yakubu, \u201cthe commission is aware that Nigerians would like to know when the exercise will be devolved beyond our state and local government offices to enable more citizens to register.\n\n\u201cSecondly, for those already registered, they would like to know when their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) will be available for collection. The Commission is working on these concerns and issues and will issue a comprehensive schedule for both activities early in the new year\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Ekiti and Osun guber elections, the INEC chairman said \u201cpolitical parties intending to field candidates at the 2022 end of tenure of governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun states, have been charged to ensure their primaries are conducted under free, fair, and credible atmosphere to ensure they make submissions to INEC within the stipulated time spelt out in the timetable and schedule\u2019s of activities for the elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commission, while making the call, urged challenged political parties to hold themselves to the same high standard of free, fair, transparent and credible elections that they expect from INEC during general elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe commission wishes to remind political parties that in choosing their candidates for these elections, they must abide by the provisions of the law, INEC\u2019s regulations and guidelines as well as their Constitutions and guidelines.\n\n\u201cINEC will monitor the primaries as required by law. Political parties must therefore hold themselves to the same high standard of free, fair, transparent and credible elections that they expect from INEC during general elections.\n\n\u201cAny political party that fails to conduct democratic primaries within the timeframe provided in the Commission\u2019s Timetable and Schedule of Activities cannot be expected to submit the names of candidates to INEC for elections\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe commission released the timetable and schedule of activities for the Ekiti Governorship election holding on 18th June 2022 and the Osun Governorship election scheduled for 16th July 2022, June this year. According to the INEC Chairman \u201ca major activity for the two Governorship elections is the conduct of primaries by political parties for the nomination of candidates for the election.\n\n\u201cFor Ekiti state, the exercise begins in the next 2 weeks on 4th January 2022 and ends on 29th January 2022. In the case of Osun State, party primaries begin on 16th February 2022 and ends on 12th March 2022\u201d.\n\nProfessor Yakubu also highlighted that some bye-elections by the commission would be conducted early in 2022.\n\n.He said \u201cthere are eight pending bye-elections involving three federal constituencies (Jos North/Bassa in Plateau state, Akure North/Akure South in Ondo state and Ogoja/Yala in Cross River state) and five state constituencies (Shinkafi in Zamfara state, Ekiti East I in Ekiti state, Akpabuyo in Cross River state, Pankshin South in Plateau state and Giwa West in Kaduna state)\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn addition to these off cycle elections, we must also continue to prepare for the 2023 General Election. We have so many physical facilities to rebuild, materials to replace, regulations and guidelines to work on, consultations with stakeholders to strengthen, capacity of our staff to enhance and several aspects of election administration to improve upon. Next year is therefore going to be a very busy year for us,\u201dthe INEC Chairman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the BIMODAL system, INEC said it has learnt its lessons and assured Nigerians that there would be tremendous improvement that would lead to optimal performance in future elections\n\n\n\nThe assurance came from the Chairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, during a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioner\u2019s (RECs), in Abuja.\n\nHe noted that like every new technology, glitches were observed and lessons learnt when the commission replaced the Smart Card Reader(SCR), with the BVAS and deployed it for the first time in a major election in the November 6, 2021, Anambra state governorship election.\n\n\n\nAccording to Prof. Yakubu \u201cthe Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) was deployed for the first time in a major election after the successful pilot in the Isoko South I State Constituency in Delta State in September this year. The BVAS has replaced the Smart Card Reader for verification and authentication as part of our improved voter accreditation process\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe new technology was designed in-house by INEC engineers. Like every new technology, glitches were observed and important lessons learnt. We wish to assure Nigerians that the Commission has reviewed the performance of the BVAS in Anambra State and there will be a tremendous improvement leading to optimal performance in future elections\u201d. He reiterated that \u201cthe BVAS has come to stay.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cso too is the uploading of Polling Unit results on the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal in real-time on Election Day. We are convinced that the introduction of technology in voter accreditation and result management is better than the best entirely manual process. It also increases public confidence in the process. We will continue to deepen the use of technology in our elections.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman spoke further on other technologies deployed for the first time in Anambra that have come to stay.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe second technological innovation introduced in the Anambra Governorship election went virtually unnoticed by many Nigerians. For sometime now, dedicated portals were created by Commission to handle different aspect of the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, the nomination of candidates by political parties, including the uploading of nomination forms, is now done online. So too is the accreditation of election observers and the media. In addition, and for the first time in the history of the Commission, the accreditation of polling and collation agents nominated by political parties was done online. This has ensured that all such agents were provided with identification tags bearing not only their party logos, names and other personal details but personal photographs as well.\n\n\u201cIn all, the commission issued 63,745 identification tags to agents of the 18 political parties that sponsored candidates for the election. This has sanitized the process and made the identification of ghost party agents easier. We will maintain the same arrangement for all forthcoming elections, including the 2023 general elections.\u201d",

          "title": "Electoral Bill: Fayemi, Ortom Back Buhari As CSOs, Others Question Decision",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to assent to the electoral act amendment bill drew reactions from several quarters on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Governors such as Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti and Samuel Ortom of Ekiti lauded the President\u2019s decision, civil society organisations and some federal lawmakers were clearly disappointed.\n\nThe National Assembly had transmitted the bill to the President in November but, in a letter dated December 13 and forwarded to the National Assembly, he informed of his decision to withhold his signature.\n\nIn his letter, President Buhari cited several issues with the bill\u2019s clause on direct primaries.\n\nThe President, according to the letter, explained that direct primaries are expensive. This, he said, will put a financial burden on the country\u2019s resources.\n\nHe further noted that conducting direct primary elections will be tasking, explaining that since such mode of election means a large turnout of voters, the move would stretch the security agencies.\n\nThe Nigerian leader equally fears that with direct primaries, citizens\u2019 rights will be violated while smaller political parties may face marginalisation.\n\nAccording to him, the move will also lead to more litigations by party members.\n\nSenators deliberate next move\n\nSenators on Tuesday held closed-door sessions to discuss next steps over the bill.\n\nA Senator of the Peoples Democratic Party, George Sekibo, in an interview with Channels Television said some Senators were considering a veto of the bill.\n\nBy law, the National Assembly can bypass presidential assent of a bill into law through a two-third majority vote.\n\nAccording to Sekibo, a total of 73 signatures have been compiled for the veto.\n\nHowever, Senate President Lawan adjourned Tuesday\u2019s session till tomorrow (Wednesday) where a decision over the matter is expected to be made.\n\nReps eye 2022\n\nAt the House of Representatives, deliberations over the bill\u2019s setback was shifted to 2022.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbjabiamila revealed this on Tuesday as the lawmakers went on recess for the Christmas and New Year break.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, that bill has not received presidential assent, and it falls to parliament to decide the best way forward,\u201d Gbjabiamila told his colleagues. \u201cWhen we return in the new year, we will resume our efforts to reform the electoral system in our country; and we will do it together.\n\n\u201cThat is what the Nigerian people expect of us, and we will do our duty for God and country. As long as this one breathes, it will survive. When we return, we will address it.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nGbajabiamila explained that the time was short to address the sensitive issue at hand in haste because members were set to proceed on break, and they must pass other important bills such as the 2022 Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill before doing so.\n\nHe stated that the new bill introduced several innovations, besides direct primaries, to help advance the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe speaker, who commended the lawmakers for the efforts they made to ensure the passage of the bill, reminded them of the Legislative Agenda of the 9th House, which he said must be followed through to its conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn the past, election years have witnessed a decline in governance activities as political pursuits cloud the calendar. That will not be the case this time around. As you are aware, we have a legislative agenda in this 9th House of Representatives, which we tagged \u2018Our Contract with Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI expect that we will do everything within our power to keep the commitments we made in that document so that when we appear before our various constituencies, we can stand tall in the knowledge that despite challenges and difficulties, we did what we promised to do and given a chance again, will do even more.\u201d\n\nCivil societies kick\n\nMeanwhile, civil society organisations expressed displeasure at the President\u2019s decision not to assent to the bill.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Executive Director, Clement Nwankwo, Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC) said the situation was \u201cworrying\u201d and \u201cposes a serious threat to the conduct of the forthcoming 2023 Nigerian General Elections.\u201d\n\nHowever, PLAC urged the National Assembly to review the President\u2019s demands on party primaries \u201cin order to save the other landmark reforms contained in the Electoral Bill 2021, over which the President has expressed no worries.\u201d\n\n\u201cPLAC is also calling on the National Assembly to treat the issue of passing the new Electoral Bill as a matter of national emergency and convene a special session in the shortest possible time and irrespective of their end of year break, to consider a vote for the passage of the Electoral Bill 2021,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHuman rights lawyer and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, described President\u2019s Buhari decision as akin to throwing out the baby and the bathwater.\n\n\u201cThe reason adduced for the rejection of the Electoral Amendment Bill is grossly misleading,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cSection 87 of the current Electoral Act provides for either direct or indirect primaries. In fact, the APC used direct primary for the emergence of its presidential candidate in 2019. In other words, President Buhari is a beneficiary of direct primary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy rejecting the Bill on the ground that it provided for direct primary the President decided to throw away the baby and the bathwater. Thus, the President rejected electronic voting which he had endorsed when he admitted that he is a beneficiary of electronic accreditation of voters by the use of card readers.\n\n\u201cWith respect, direct primary is in consonance with section 223 of the Constitution which has imposed a duty on political parties to elect their officers through democratic elections. There is no provision in the Constitution for the imposition of candidates by money bags through indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cThe INEC has submitted a bill of N305 billion for the entire 2023 general elections. So who conjured the figure of N500 billion for the primaries to give the impression that it is an expensive venture? In any case, since electronic voting had been adopted by the National Assembly it was going to be used for both primary and general elections. So the cost would have been significantly reduced. The fear of insecurity is a red herring in that political parties have continued to hold huge rallies even in defiance of Covid 19 restrictions imposed by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cHaving rejected to assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill in 2018 and 2021, President Buhari has confirmed beyond any shadow of a doubt that his administration will not allow the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct credible elections in 2023 and thereafter. That is going to be the tragic legacy of the President and the ruling party that were campaigning for electoral reforms before the 2015 general elections.\n\n\u201cThe challenge before the National Assembly is to invoke the provision of section 58 (5) of the Constitution to pass the Bill into law by the resolution of two-thirds majority of the members. However, if the national assembly cannot muster the required two-thirds majority, section 87 of the Act which allows direct or indirect primaries should be left intact so that the other provisions of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 can be passed again by the legislators and assented to by the President.\u201d\n\nPraise for Buhari\n\nAfter meeting with the President on Tuesday, Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Kayode Fayemi praised the decision to withhold assent on the electoral bill.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents after meeting with the President in his office, the Fayemi said it does not matter to the governors which mode is adopted for the conduct of primaries.\n\nThe governor, who is also the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, dismissed talks that the President was simply conceding to the wishes of the governors.\n\nWhile noting that the President\u2019s desire is to see that all options are provided for, there is an exaggerated expectation that direct primaries will resolve electoral challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cI think all of us should be happy with that we shouldn\u2019t really dwell too much on there\u2019s been this exaggerated expectation that direct primaries is going to provide all answers to whatever electoral challenges that we have faced,\u201d he said.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Governor noted that both direct and indirect primaries have unique challenges and called for options to be provided.\n\nBenue State Governor Ortom also commended the President\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity again on behalf of people that are represented here in Benue State to commend Mr. President for withholding assent on the process of primaries of various political parties,\u201d he said at a briefing at the end of the meeting of the State Executive Council on Tuesday in Makurdi.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the National Assembly to reconsider the clause that allows for only direct primaries, and all the reasons that Mr. President advanced concerning the support for him withholding his assent are deeply appreciated.\n\n\u201cI assure you that as a veteran politician who had the privilege to witness direct primaries, witness indirect primaries, and witness consensus primaries, and someone who has the privilege to be a member of various political parties, it was almost unanimous that the issue of primaries should be the responsibility of various political parties.\u201d",

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "A Madagascan minister was one of two survivors to have swum some 12 hours to shore Tuesday after their helicopter crashed off the island\u2019s northeastern coast, authorities said. A search was still ongoing for two other passengers after the crash on Monday, the cause not immediately clear, said police and port authorities. Serge Gelle, the country\u2019s secretary of state for police, and a fellow policeman reached land in the seaside town of Mahambo separately on Tuesday morning, apparently after ejecting themselves from the aircraft, said port authority chief Jean-Edmond Randrianantenaina.\n\nIn a video shared on social media, 57-year-old Gelle appears lying exhausted on a deck chair, still in his camouflage uniform. \u201cMy time to die hasn\u2019t come yet,\u201d says the general, adding he is cold but not injured.\n\nGelle became minister as part of a cabinet reshuffle in August after serving in the police for three decades.\n\nZafisambatra Ravoavy, another police general, said Gelle had used one of the helicopter\u2019s seats as a flotation device.\n\n\u201cHe has always had great stamina in sport, and he\u2019s kept up this rhythm as minister, just like a thirty-year-old,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has nerves of steel.\u201d",

Shatu Garko hails from Kano State and represented the northwest geo-political zone at the competition where she defeated 17 other contestants at the grand finale.
