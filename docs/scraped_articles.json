          "text": "Taliban fighters take control of Afghan presidential palace after the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, in Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, Aug. 15, 2021. (AP Photo/Zabi Karimi)\n\nHundreds of Afghans took to the streets of Kabul on Tuesday, demanding that Pakistan stops interfering in Afghanistan\u2019s affairs.\n\nThe protests took place in at least two locations in the city centre, with participants chanting slogans against Pakistani meddling in the country.\n\nMany Afghans, including former officials, said Pakistan was supporting the Taliban and has helped them in their recent military campaign, during which the militant group took over the country.\n\nREAD ALSO:Islamic State claims rocket attack targeting Kabul airport\n\nIslamabad has denied any involvement.\n\nIn one of the many videos of the protests circulating on social media or on local TV, a female participant said she and the other protesters are not there for personal gains, but to defend their country.\n\n\u201cWe are here to defend our country. Pakistan has started a direct invasion in Afghanistan and we are asking why its chief intelligence is here? What is his purpose?\u201d\n\nOn Sunday and Monday, the head of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service ISI, Faiz Hameed, visited Kabul and conducted meetings with Taliban officials.\n\nAccording to a BBC reporter, many protesters in Kabul alleged Pakistan supported the Taliban in fighting in Panjshir province, which fell to the Taliban on Monday after almost a week of fighting.\n\nMany protesters chanted \u201cFreedom\u201d probably hinting at support for Ahmad Massud, who led the armed National Resistance Front in Panjshir and is in hiding since the Taliban took over the province.\n\nHe had called all Afghans to a national uprising in an audio message on Monday and shortly after tweeted only the word \u201cFreedom.\u201d\n\nA foreign journalist wrote on Twitter, that, for several km, well-disciplined Taliban members allowed a protest of around 300 to 500 people to continue through the streets of Kabul.\n\nTaliban members guarding Zanbak Square, however, fired in the air, beat protesters, vandalized a vehicle leading them, and tore cameras from journalists.\n\nThe popular news channel ToloNews reported on Twitter that the Taliban detained a ToloNews camera operator and confiscated his camera.\n\nA former member of parliament in northern Balkh province said a similar protest also took place against Pakistan late on Monday in Mazar-e Sharif",

          "text": "Again worries over conflicting court orders\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi\n\nAbuja\u2014THE Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, said yesterday that conflicting orders by courts were making its job difficult difficult.\n\nIt also declared that no one will be allowed to vote except such a person had undergone an electronic authentication of his identity, using its Bimodal Voter Accreditation System BVAS.\n\nREAD ALSO:Guber poll: INEC suspends physical voters\u2019 registration in Anambra\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this during the commission\u2019s third quarterly meeting with political parties in Abuja yesterday, \u201cI am aware that some of the cases are still in court and, therefore, sub judice. I must say that some of the decided cases are making our work difficult and we have been crying out loud for a long time. In particular, some pre-election litigation relating to the nomination of candidates for elections were not determined until after the elections.\n\nIt also lamented the growing number of conflicting court orders and judgments which were usually procured by politicians seeking to outmaneuver one another.\n\nAnambra Polls\n\nOn Anambra governorship election, Yakubu said the commission would use the next few weeks to compile the register of voters for claims and objections, clean up the data, print the Permanent Voter Cards, PVCs, for collection by registrants and compile the register for each of the 5,720 polling units in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to assure every newly registered voter in Anambra State, including those who applied to transfer from within and outside the state or for the replacement of damaged or lost PVCs that their cards will be printed and made available to them for collection before the election.\n\n\u2018\u2019Each political party fielding candidates in the election will be given a copy of the voters\u2019 register on 7th October 2021 as published in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the elections.\u201d\n\nHe said the commission had also been continuously innovating on how to strengthen the credibility of voter accreditation and result management during elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, many stakeholders, including leaders of political parties, have called on the commission to strengthen the voter accreditation process during elections, especially with reference to the use of incident form where the Smart Card Reader SCR fails to authenticate the fingerprints of a voter.\n\nThe INEC boss said: \u201cSuch concern is legitimate, given the fact that the SCR successfully verifies any card that belongs to the polling unit for which it is configured, irrespective of who presents it. Their apprehension, therefore, is that using the incident form to cover those whose fingerprints are not authenticated by the SCR, a voter may be able to use another person\u2019s PVC to vote during an election.\n\nConflicting orders\n\nProf. Yakubu also denounced the usual resort of politicians to obtaining conflicting court orders which he said rubbishes the legal concept of \u201cstare decisis\u201d as what was supposedly settled in law had now become unsettled.\n\nHe said: \u201cI cannot conclude my remarks without touching on the issue of litigation, particularly the conflicting orders emanating from courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in some instances, political parties were declared winners without candidates to immediately receive the Certificates of Return on account of protracted and conflicting litigation or where courts rather than votes determine winners of elections.\n\n\u201cTo address this concern, the commission attempted to introduce the facial biometric authentication during accreditation of the voters using the Z-Pad tablet to complement the fingerprint process through the card reader before Edo governorship election in September 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the commission was not entirely satisfied with the pilot held in the Nasarawa Central State constituency bye-election a month earlier in August 2020. We, therefore, suspended the idea to enable us do some more work.\n\n\u2018\u2019Over the last one year, we reviewed the situation and we think we have found the appropriate technology to address it. The Z-pad was, therefore, only used to upload polling unit results to the IReV portal during elections.\n\n\u201cThe functionality of the Z-pad has now been integrated into the IVED currently used for voter registration. On Election Day, the same device will be used for the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, for fingerprint authentication during accreditation and where it fails for facial authentication.\n\n\u2018\u2019We believe that this multi-layer process will eliminate the possibility of voting by identity theft using another person\u2019s PVC. Where the voter fails both the fingerprint and facial authentication, he/she will not be allowed to vote.

In particular, some pre-election litigation relating to the nomination of candidates for elections were not determined until after the elections.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in some instances, political parties were declared winners without candidates to immediately receive the Certificates of Return on account of protracted and conflicting litigation or where courts rather than votes determine winners of elections.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nEbonyi Governor, Dave Umahi, has said those observing sit-at-home directive of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the South East despite its suspension were doing so out of fear.\n\nHe warned that the trend was a grave threat to the economy of the region.\n\nThe governor stated this while briefing journalists after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday.\n\n\u201cI think is not more or less complying to the directive of IPOB or no IPOB, suspended or not suspended, it is a question of fear. You know, the easiest thing to do is to carry weapon and kill somebody, and that\u2019s what happened in the past. And that\u2019s why some people in South East are afraid of coming out. Even if you go now to the streets and say that you hold AK-47, you will see that everybody will desert the streets. So it\u2019s not a question of compliance. It\u2019s a question of fear.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said there was need for improved security in the South East to allow movement of people, especially for trade and commerce purpose.\n\n\u201cNo South East man wants to miss a day of work; they like to work, they are into trade and commerce, and they want to earn their daily living. Security agencies must know that they owe South East people the duty to protect their lives. This is the reason why it appears that in some states there is compliance of the sit-at-home order. But it\u2019s the worst thing to happen because it will destroy the economy of South East.\u201d\n\nHe said leaders of the zone in collaboration with Ohanaeze Ndigbo were working together on how to address grievances of youths in the region against marginalisation with a view to presenting it to the president.\n\nHe also announced that President Muhammadu Buhari would be visiting the state in November to commission over 20 projects comprising roads, medical centres, malls, bridges, among others.\n\nOn if he and his counterparts in the region were considering encouraging the two major parties to select their candidates for the 2023 presidential election from the South East, Umahi said it was too early and a distraction to talk about the next election.\n\n\u201cWell, for me, I am very much entrenched in completing my projects. And I will look into politics when my tenure is remaining one year, which is from May 29, 2022. And I think it is the same thing with other governors of South East and by extension, governors of APC. My position about what you ask is that our people that are in those political parties are making the efforts in selling the need for South East to produce the next president. But I think both the governors and Mr. President should not be distracted. With elections done and won, the next thing should be governance.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke about the relevance of the South East security outfit, Ebubeagu saying, \u201cit\u2019s quite formidable and doing a great job in synergy will all the security agencies. And if you read through the newspapers, you see a lot of exploits that are being done in the South East. It is quite tasking, security wise, and we are tackling it.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Eniola Olakunri\n\nIt is no longer news that President Muhammadu Buhari has signed the Petroleum Industry Bill into law, bringing to a close, the nearly 2-decade old clamour for a sound legal, fiscal, and regulatory framework to govern the business activities of the Nigerian petroleum industry.\n\nChristened \u201cPetroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021\u201d, the enactment (apart from other salient provisions), also allotted host communities some 3 percent (from expenditures undertaken by oil and gas prospecting companies); a decision that has drawn the opprobrium of Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and other stakeholders who hold that the provision is minuscule, given the direct economic hardship, poverty and neglect, oil activities over the years, have visited on their people.\n\nIt remains to be seen if President Buhari\u2019s further appeal to the host communities to accept the 3 percent allocation will ring true, and gain traction with the stakeholders in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nThe PIA has been long in coming. According to the President, its non-passage over the years \u201c\u2026. stagnated the growth of the industry and prosperity of our economy. In the last ten years, Nigeria has lost the estimated US $50 billion worth of investments due to the uncertainty created by the non-passage of the PIB\u2026\u201d He also said the Act will attract the necessary investment in the petroleum sector, adding that employment, increased revenue and the development of other critical sectors of the economy now remain quite feasible.\n\nAs much as the PIA is largely welcomed by industry watchers and other stakeholders, the fate of the 3 Agencies involved in getting petrol to the final consumers is still shrouded somewhat. Perhaps this was the reason a national daily (not Thisday), reported the day after the President appended his signature to the PIA, that 2 of them and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) were to be \u201cscrapped\u201d.\n\nEven though the Agencies namely, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management) Board, Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), and Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency(PPPRA) would now be under the supervision of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (referred to as \u201cThe Authority\u201d) under the Act, there is nothing in the bill that suggested they would be scrapped. Only the NNPC was specifically indicated, would transmute into a new enterprise, to be named \u201d Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd\u201d.\n\nBe that as it may, the new superintendent of the 3 Agencies involved in fuel matters -The Authority- needs to ensure that the relative tranquillity being enjoyed in the petrol supply currently, nationwide is not jeopardised in any way.\n\nWe are very much aware that constant and hitch-free petrol supply makes the wheel of our economy go round, especially if we factor in, the daily activities of transporters, barbers/hairdressers, tailors/seamstresses, eateries, vulcanisers and a host of other small scale business owners, who all, but rely on petrol to power their generators due to inadequate or absence of electricity supply from the Power Companies.\n\nTo be sure, The Authority\u2019s objectives include(but are not limited to the following):\n\n*Regulation of midstream/downstream operations including technical, operational and commercial activities\n\n*Promoting the supply and distribution of natural gas and petroleum products and the security of natural gas supply for the domestic market\n\n*Ensuring safe, efficient, effective and seamless development of infrastructure for the sector\n\n*Implementation of sound policies for the petroleum operations under its sphere of influence, in line with the provisions of the Act and as directed by the Minister of Petroleum Resources.\n\n*Ensuring the supply of crude to refineries domiciled in Nigeria\n\n*Make certain that the technical standards, practices and codes governing midstream/downstream operations are in line with international best practices\n\n*Developing and ensuring compliance with tariff/pricing it deems fair for all stakeholders and other provisions as spelt out in the Act.\n\nHowever, going forward, it behoves the Authority to leverage on the strengths of the individual agencies under its supervision for superior delivery/performance. DPR could step up its cooperation and work with the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) and Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, in keeping the activities of the smuggling rings of crude and petrol at bay. Nigeria is losing colossal amounts daily due to crude and petrol theft.\n\nAlso, PPPRA should concentrate on its expertise in working its templates to ensure that the prices at which petrol is being sourced and sold, are fair to all parties.\n\nTwo months ago, the Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Mele Kyari, raised an alarm that the daily consumption of petrol has reached some 103 million litres! This took industry observers and other stakeholders by surprise.\n\nRecently, the Minister tried to walk back that assertion by the MD. He described it as the 103 million litres/day recorded in May as \u201cflash\u201d. Hear him, as quoted by Thisday Newspaper of August 18th, 2021. \u201cBut of course, you know we have flashes. Sometimes, we have these flashes. The daily consumption was about 66 million litres per month when we came in, and we were able to bring it down to 52 million. That\u2019s the average..\u201d\n\nHe went on \u201c\u2026but once in a while, you have that flash and it goes up, maybe because of the activities of smugglers. Well, these are not ideal situations, you cannot readily use that as the measure of average consumption\u2026 You can\u2019t discount these flashes that you have, which you cannot really judge us on\u201d.\n\nIf indeed, these flashes do occur now and then, it therefore means every effort should be made to nip this upsurge or \u201cflashes\u201d largely ascribed to the nefarious activities of smugglers. It is no doubt a huge drain on the Nigerian economy, tottering as it is.\n\nFacts and real-time adequate data on the daily consumption of petrol should be a sine qua non of petrol supply and distribution processes, nationwide.\n\nDAFMIS to the rescue\n\nFrom the Minister\u2019s postulation, The Authority has its job cut out. It must get all facts and information on petrol consumption patterns from the get-go and in real-time.\n\nOf the 3 Agencies identified earlier (PEF (M)B), DPR and PPPRA, the ones with the most robust automation processes that cover every gamut of petrol supply and distribution are PEF(M)B, according to industry watchers. This is where The Authority should lean on for on the spot information on petrol movements all across the country.\n\nIn May 2016, PEF(M)B started developing, in collaboration with the National Information Technology Development Agency(NITDA), the \u201cDownstream Automated Fuel Management Information System\u201d (DAFMIS); primed to ensuring real-time monitoring and data processing of petrol movement(s) in Nigeria, to the last mile.\n\nDAFMIS, a further improvement on \u2018Aquila'(the first automation process embarked upon by the Agency), was endorsed by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and approved by the Federal Executive Council in May 2019 for a 3-year trial. Today, the system working perfectly for all operational processes for PEF(M) B, and is being acclaimed by industry experts, as the most all-encompassing, in delivering information on petrol distribution and its operational processes in Nigeria.\n\nSome of DAFMIS features include, but not limited to:\n\n*Provision of an electronic eye (sensor network) that spawns real-time information in depots and fuel trucks (including their compartments). Massive retrofitting of petrol tankers were embarked upon nationwide to ensure the success of the scheme. For instance, a truck laden with 33,000 litres of petrol with 11,000 litres in each of its 3 compartments, is monitored by the electronic eye, and if in the course of the journey, the driver decided to offload part of the product somewhere before getting to it\u2019s destination, he/she would be caught out. Besides that, the movements of trucks are also monitored effectively and it is easy to locate their positions at any given time.\n\nArrangements are on to extend the processes to cover vessels, pipelines and filling stations. It is an ingenious system that guarantees the tracking of products everywhere and on the go.\n\n* Ability to cut waste, improve efficiency and identify loopholes in the petrol distribution chain.\n\n*Business Improvement; poised to upgrade the work processes between departments as well as on-field operations for overall efficiency.\n\n*Business Applications; designed to manage petrol marketers claims and reconciliations much more accurately\n\n*Document Management System; billed for digitising and archiving documents in all departments and across all stations nationwide. It also makes for an enhanced offsite backup mechanism that guarantees document security.\n\nPEF(M)B has also upgraded its Data Centre in Abuja, and also built a backup Centre in Lagos towards ensuring that information safety is guaranteed at all times.\n\nIn addition, its Operations and Command Centre (OCC) is up and running. This ensures that field operations are monitored 24 hours and round the clock; day in, day out. In effect, untoward incidents can be dealt with in real-time. OCC promotes enhanced visibility of operations within the system and its processes are modelled after that of Aramco, the highly regarded Saudi Arabian oil company.\n\nThe Authority will also find The Automation System useful when it appoints domestic Gas Aggregator\u201d for the sole purpose of promoting the use of gas in relevant sectors within the polity. The Act empowers The Authority to \u201c\u2026implement a natural gas management model through which the demand and supply of natural gas for use in the strategic sectors shall be monitored\u201d. This means an independent source of information on all the processes on gas production, supply and distribution are available and on-demand apart from data presented to The Authority by The Gas Aggregator. This is a win ultimately for Nigeria as incidence(s) of sharp practices can be minimised considerably.\n\nDAFMIS which runs in line with global best practices supports the making of critical and on-time decisions in the downstream sub-sector of the petroleum industry and can furnish information to sister Agencies such as DPR and PPPRA, in working their templates.\n\nOther bodies such as the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), and some of the nation\u2019s economic planners in the mould of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to mention a few, can also be supplied with requisite data on petrol movements.\n\nDAFMIS will no doubt serve as a willing tool to PIA. The Authority, oil industry and the nation at large, will no doubt, reap bountifully from its full deployment, covering every sphere of petrol business supply, distribution, monitoring and operational processes, all in one fell swoop.\n\n*Eniola Olakunri, a Director of Oats Global Energy and public sector analyst writes from Abuja (eniolaolakunri@gmail.com)\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Wale Igbintade\n\nA group, Media Rights Agenda (MRA), has condemned the directive by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to telecommunications\u2019 companies to immediately shutdown all telecommunications services in Zamfara State as a result of the \u201cencompassing security situation\u201d in the state.\n\nIt described the measure as an unwarranted and unjustifiable interference with the rights to freedom of expression and access to information.\n\nIn a statement issued in Lagos yesterday, the MRA Communications Officer, Mr. Idowu Adewale, alleged that the NCC, which is supposed to be a regulatory agency, has increasingly become a tool in the hands of the federal government for to indiscriminately violate the rights of Nigerians.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cSuch purported exercise of power without regard to deny communications services not only to the residents of Zamfara State, but also to other people elsewhere who have family members, friends, loved one as well as other social or business relations in the state. They denial of the right to communicate with others without judicial or any other form of independent oversight cannot be justified under any circumstance.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence anywhere in the world that shutting down communication services, including access to the internet and telephone communication, helps improve security, prevent terrorist attacks, or stop them. Indeed, commonsense and available evidence indicate that the more likely result from such a measure is that the operations of security agencies and emergency services will be thwarted by the obstruction of vital public communications during periods of terrorists attacks when their services are most needed.\u201d\n\nThe statement observed that there was already ample support for this proposition from the Nigerian experience when in 2013, the government also shut down telecommunications services in three states in the North-east-Adamawa, Borno and Yobe-to ostensibly disrupt Boko Haram\u2019s communication capacity and its ability to use telecommunications to plan, coordinate and launch terrorist attacks.\n\nThe group recalled that \u201cthe experience then was that not only did terrorist attacks by Boko Haram insurgents continued throughout the period when telecommunication services were cut off, but in many instances, the attacks actually appeared to have intensified.\u201d\n\nBesides, the statement cited a study conducted entitled: \u2018Silencing Boko Haram: Mobile Phone Blackout and Counterinsurgency in Nigeria\u2019s Northeast region\u2019, which was published in an international security journal known as \u2018Stability: International Journal of Security & Development\u2019, Volume 4(1).\n\nAccording to him, the study clearly showed that the disruption of telecommunications services was counterproductive as it caused a lot of frustration and anxiety among the people in the area as well as heightened their sense of insecurity because they were unable to determine what is going on around them, could not access important news and information, could not reach emergency services and could not check on their loved ones.\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the NCC to immediately rescind its directive to the telecommunications companies, and urged security agencies to find more innovative and effective ways to address the security situation that are nonetheless consistent with the government\u2019s human rights obligations and the rights of people as a condition for protecting them, which is not only abhorrent but itself a violation of human rights norms and principles.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This is when a private company decides to go \u201cpublic\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil firm of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, went public with record international initial public offering.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday, Kyari said the NNPC would not be able to offer its shares to the public by 2022 or 2023 due to certain bottlenecks that had lingered over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Kyari disclosed that the national oil company would be transformed into a private company that would pay taxes and dividends to its shareholders as specified by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nOn the IPO launch, he explained that the books of the NNPC would need to be properly cleaned up, with the proposed NNPC Limited recapitalised, before embarking on such a huge business decision.\n\n\u201cWe will be in the position to consider any IPO in three years; that is the provision of the law,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut when you want to get ready for IPO, you need to do things differently.

Before he was appointed to the rank in 2018, he was an assistant professor/clinical epidemiologist from 2014 to April 2018 (at the same school).\n\nHe joined the school in 2014 and work overseas as a clinical epidemiologist at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to joining the institution, he worked as a clinical epidemiologist at the medical research council unit, The Gambia at the LSHTM with research interests in tuberculosis epidemiology.\n\nHis research interests are in vaccine impact/effectiveness studies, innovative approaches/surveillance tools for monitoring vaccination, tuberculosis epidemiology, and evidence synthesis including systematic reviews.\n\nHe was awarded the MRC/DFID African Research Leader Fellowship in 2018.\n\nAdetifa is a member of multiple medical advisory groups including the Kenyan National Immunisation Coordinating Committee and the World Health Organisation, Africa Region\u2019s (WHO-AFRO) Regional Immunisation Technical Advisory Group.\n\n\u2018VISION FOR EFFECTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES\u2019\n\nIn one of his interviews, Adetifa said he is an infectious disease expert and \u201cgenerally interested in who they happen to, where they happen, why they happen and intervention to prevent them from happening\u201d.\n\nReiterating this interest on his LinkedIn profile, Adetifa said his \u201cvision as a paediatrician and infectious diseases epidemiologist is to see equitable and effective protection against vaccine-preventable diseases in the low and middle-income countries of tropical Africa\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy work to date has been on investigating the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, conducting an epidemiological evaluation of vaccines; and on demonstrating the utility of seroepidemiology for monitoring vaccination and profiling population immunity; all for informing vaccine policy,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI serve in various advisory roles in the area of vaccines and immunisation at national, continental and global levels for example, on the WHO African Region\u2019s Regional Immunisation Technical Advisory Group.\n\n\u201cProven significant experience of multidisciplinary collaboration in the area of immunisation for research and policy. Experience in research project management including managing multiple research projects; significant involvement in design and implementation of large-scale projects in infectious diseases epidemiology\u201d.\n\nTHE TASK AHEAD\n\nIn December 2020, when the country was yet to secure any dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, Adetifa advised the federal government to \u201cdispel a lot of the myths\u201d, that will trail the COVID vaccine when it becomes available in the country, adding that \u201cthere is no point having an efficacious vaccine if people will not receive it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has been a gap in appropriate communication regarding COVID vaccination and I think there now needs to be an effort to ramp up relevant information and community engagement with respect to imminent availability of COVID vaccines in other to address the concerns of the population and to dispel a lot of the myths and the wrong information that is going around,\u201d he said in an interview with Monitor Your Health, a medical journal on Youtube.\n\n\u201cThere is no point having an efficacious vaccine if people will not receive it. So if you have got a vaccine that is 95 percent efficacious and you only achieve 40-50 percent coverage, it is a complete waste of time.\u201d\n\nAdetifa will have to consolidate the gains recorded by his predecessor \u2014 and do even more \u2014 including executing more community engagements to dispel the misinformation on the COVID vaccine.\n\nPhotos: Ifedayo Adetifa/Twitter",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

Gen. Tukur Buratai, during a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who hailed Buratai for his service to the nation, said the country is building on the foundation laid by the ex-Army chief in the fight against insecurity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe foundation you laid as Chief of Army Staff is what we are building on today. You are here in Edo because we appreciate what you have done for this country.\n\n\u201cOur Esama of Benin, whom we are very proud of, is a very vast and foresighted man that is always full of gratitude. When he named that centre after you, you were in service. It was deliberate because at no time in our history were we faced with the kind of security challenges that you faced as Chief of Army Staff.\n\n\u201cWe could see how God used you to overcome those challenges. For us as a state, the relationship that we have with the military today was laid during your tenure. You have always been dependable and that encouraged us to develop a very mutual relationship with the military commission in Edo.\n\n\u201cYou are here today to commission a centre. At no time in our history have we needed to focus on security as strategically as we should now, which is why this centre for me is important. It is necessary that we are taking the issue of security seriously.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAs a state, we will continue to work with the national authorities. Like I keep saying, Nigeria has come to stay. We are facing our challenges like other countries and communities in the world and that is where we need leaders like you to step up.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what people do to you personally; as long as you know you are there serving God and the people, doing what we believe is the right thing and in the interest of our people and our country. Politics will come and go; politicians will come and go, but Nigeria will remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in Edo, we will continue to do our own bit in contributing to the harmony and unity of Nigeria,\u201d the governor reassured.\n\nEarlier, Buratai said he was in Benin to inaugurate the Buratai Centre for Contemporary Security Affairs, a centre which was named after him by Igbinedion University, Okada.\n\n...",

Sale Mamman.\n\nRecall that President Buhari had last week, in an uncharacteristic move, announced the sack of Nanono and Mamman.\n\nPresident Buhari, in a widely reported speech at the Federal Executive Meeting, predicated his decision on a claimed \u201cindependent and critical self-review\u201d of sectorial performance and evaluation.\n\nAccording to Mr President, \u201cTwo years and some months into the second term, the tradition of subjecting our projects and programs implementation to independent and critical self-review had taken firm roots through sector reporting during cabinet meetings and at retreats.\n\n\u201cThese significant review steps had helped to identify and strengthen weak areas, close gaps, build cohesion and synergy in governance, manage the economy and improve the delivery of public good to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Chidoka founder of UnlockNaija, a Volunteer group committed to the renewal of the idea of Nigeria and unlocking the self-created gridlock obstructing the realisation of improved quality of life for all, noted that the statement announcing the sack gave the impression that Buhari evaluates and monitors the activities of his appointees through independent review and monitoring alignment with the nine priority areas of the government.\n\nAccording to the former minister, \u201cNigerians would want Mr President to publish the said independent performance review, which according to him, have been going on for two years and some months into his second term and final term in office, and which led to the dismissal of the two ministers\n\n\u201cMr President is called out to immediately share with Nigerians the name(s) of the independent evaluators, the performance measurement criteria, the total result of the evaluation, as well as the rating of other sectors, particularly security, education, health, road infrastructure, finance among other critical sectors.\n\n\u201cNigerians would like to know the outcome of the assessment of the security agencies, identifying the weaknesses and communicating the plans for strengthening the identified weak areas.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Chidoka emphasized that, \u201ctwo of the nine priority areas of this administration are \u2018expand access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity of Nigerians\u2019 and \u2018improve security for all.'\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians would want to know what score the independent reviewers assigned to those responsible for growing the economy, expanding access to quality education and improving security in our country.\n\n\u201cThey would want to know how education has improved with most schools in the Northwest closed and thousands of school children kidnapped and how our economy has improved with unaffordable costs of goods and services and the fall of our naira to over N520 to the US Dollar.\n\n\u201cIf Mr President does not share these details, it would be safe to assume that the sack of Ministers is another perfunctory action couched in language to suggest that the evidently drifting country is under the control of an active pilot when the reality on the ground speaks to the contrary.\n\n\u201cMr President, prove us wrong. In the interest of transparency and your avowed commitment to change Nigeria, publish the result of this review. Also, communicate your plans to close the gaps. The proactive provision of the information would render a freedom of information request unnecessary.\u201d",

First, as an incentive to adopt Bitcoin, the government stated that the adult population of El Salvador will receive $30 worth of Bitcoin when they use the government issued wallet called \u201cChivo.\u201d\n\nAccording to Willy Woo, an on-chain analysis expert, the total adult population of El Salvador is around 4.5 million. Although the exact figures are hard to find, Statista, in 2019, said the population aged 15 and above was 4.72 million. Using Willy Woo\u2019s estimation, the government will be looking to purchase $135 million worth of Bitcoin to fulfil its promise to the people. This is evident as the President announced that the country has bought 400 BTC and is expected to buy more.\n\nAsides from this, the government has been able to install over 200 government-backed crypto ATMs, which would allow local citizens to exchange between Bitcoin and USD without paying commissions.\n\nLast week, El Salvador\u2019s Legislative Assembly also passed legislation to allow for the creation of a $150 million dollar Bitcoin Trust to support the development of crypto infrastructure and services across the country. The Trust is designed to facilitate conversion of Bitcoin into U.S. Dollars and support the roll out of vital technological infrastructure enabling widespread adoption of crypto assets.\n\nWhile the move marks a world-first, El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele said in a tweet the \u201cbitcoin process\u201d in the country comes with a \u201clearning curve.\u201d He stated, \u201cWe must break the paradigms of the past. El Salvador has the right to move toward the first world.\u201d",

          "text": "By Olanrewaju Akojede/Lagos\n\nAnxiety is mounting in Magboro Community of Ogun over a suspected Cholera outbreak, with about 10 people already feared dead.\n\nThe suspected outbreak was first reported on Friday, when a resident of the community living in an uncompleted building died.\n\nTwo persons living with her were said to have died on Saturday.\n\nMagboro Community leaders have begun a house-to-house search for victims to help them get care.\n\nThey also sealed some places to curtail further spread of the disease that can kill within hours.\n\nSome of the places were, however, reopened after disinfection.\n\n\u201cThe first person that died is a woman; two others living with her in an uncompleted building later died on Saturday,\u201d a resident, who simply identified himself as Solomon, told NAN.\n\nThe Secretary of Magboro Community Development Council, Mr David Ajayi, said that the deaths could have been averted if those affected reported on time.\n\n\u201cWe received the report of suspected cholera outbreak when the deed had already been done.\n\n\u201cI can confirm death of two people. One other person is hospitalised.\n\n\u201cAnother reported case was about a young girl taking care of her sick mother in a hospital in Asese.\n\nShe was also confirmed dead.\n\n\u201cHealth officials from Abeokuta came on Saturday and Sunday to have an on-the -spot assessment and take samples from affected persons,\u201d he said.\n\nAjayi said that the community leaders had been going round the affected areas to put some measures in place to forestall further spread.\n\n\u201cWe have been going round since we heard about the outbreak to inspect affected places. What I can confirm is that those places are not hygienic for living.\n\n\u201cThe first incident was reported on Oladejo Street, we learnt that they are paying just N50 per day to sleep in the uncompleted building, but the place has been sealed now.\n\n\u201cWe need the help of government to relocate the destitute living in open places and uncompleted buildings; those places are not hygienic for living at all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chairman of Community Development Association, Cele Zone, Mr Collins Anifowose, also told NAN that the affected places had been sealed.\n\n\u201cWe need to put our house in order to prevent disease outbreaks.\n\n\u201cAs at Sunday, 10 people were reported dead, but it has been difficult to identify them; their names were not given.\n\n\u201cThere was a reported case around us here and Sawmill area, we were told that there are squatters living in an unhygienic manner,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Hakeem Yusuf, Director, Epidemiology Unit, Ogun State Public Health Board, said that officials of Ogun Ministry of Health had visited the affected area.\n\n\u201cI came to Magboro on Sunday together with other medical personnel; we are on top of the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nA Disease Surveillance Officer in the state, Mrs Temitope Oluwalere, also told NAN that the ministry was working to tackle the situation.\n\n\u201cWe visited the affected area of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I first came on Friday, but when the case was getting out of hand, I had to call the state office.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health brought in medical and laboratory testing equipment to enable us to diagnose properly if it is cholera outbreak or not.\n\n\u201cWe got one person in an uncompleted building. He was too weak, he was transferred to a community health centre, where he is currently receiving treatment,\u201d she said.\n\nOluwalere said that samples had been sent to Abeokuta for proper diagnosis and health workers were studying the pattern of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe are still observing those hospitalised.\n\n\u201cThe first suspect is cholera, but we need further diagnosis to establish it.\n\n\u201cWe have put all private hospitals in Magboro and environs on red alert to report any case of suspected cholera and take samples,\u201d she said.\n\nCholera has been silently killing Nigerians in 23 states and Abuja.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, over 2,000 people as at 2 September have died, out of 65,000 cases reported.",

For me, it is a sensitive matter because they (the agitators) are youths; because they are very afraid of the future. What does the future hold for them?\n\n\u201cThe system has not even supported any of their dreams before, nobody even cares about them other than their parents. Some of them even lack parental value and background, and support; so, they will expect the system to support them.\u201d\n\nIn recent times, there have been increased agitations for secession and self-determination of different regions in the country, mostly led youths.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) \u2013 a group of young Nigerians in the South-East is agitating to break out of the country, some youths in the South West are also calling for a Yoruba Nation.\n\nThis has, however, been publicly condemned by a majority of traditional and political leaders in both regions who distance themselves from the action of the youths.\n\nAlthough Oba Adeyeye is one of the prominent Nigerians who insist a united Nigeria is a way forward, he warns leaders against turning a deaf ear to the yearnings of the agitators.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is a very tight position but what is key for me is whoever that is agitating, let our leaders talk to them. Let us cultivate a listening ear; it is important.\n\n\u201cIt is very sensitive, it is not an ideal thing; if a country is big, the better for everybody. The strength of us together is better but when agitations like this are coming us, listen to them,\u201d the monarch said.",

          "text": "For the umpteenth time, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has raised the alarm over the difficulty it encounters in the discharge of its duties as a result of litigations by political parties in their bid to nominate candidates.\n\nSpecifically, INEC said it has cried out loud for too long that the conflicting orders emanating from courts of coordinate jurisdiction, especially on the decided cases were making the work of the commission difficult.\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu stated this at the third quarterly meeting with political parties Monday in Abuja.\n\nHe said some pre-election litigations relating to the nomination of candidates for elections were not determined until after the elections.\n\nYakubu noted that as a result, in some instances, political parties were declared winners without candidates to immediately receive the Certificates of Return on account of protracted and conflicting litigations or where courts, rather than votes, determine winners of elections.\n\n\u201cI cannot conclude my remarks without touching on the issue of litigations, particularly the conflicting orders emanating from Courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cI am aware that some of the cases are still in Court and therefore subjudice. I must say that some of the decided cases are making our work difficult and we have been crying out loud for a long time. In particular, some pre-election litigations relating to the nomination of candidates for elections were not determined until after the elections.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in some instances, political parties were declared winners without candidates to immediately receive the Certificates of Return on account of protracted and conflicting litigations or where courts rather than votes determine winners of elections.\n\n\u201cThis situation is compounded by cases on the leadership of political parties, thereby making the exercise of our regulatory responsibilities difficult. It appears that in a number of electoral cases in Nigeria today, the settled law is now unsettled and the time-honoured principle of Stare decision does not seem to matter any longer.\n\n\u201cWhat is most disconcerting for us is that the more INEC strives to improve the credibility and transparency of our electoral process, the more extraneous obstacles are put in our way through litigations,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe INEC boss, however, hailed the recent statement by the Chief Justice of Nigeria Muhammad Tanko Ibrahim as well as the concern by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in this regard.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Commission appreciates the recent statement by His Lordship the Chief Justice of Nigeria as well as the strongly worded concern by the Nigerian Bar Association.\n\n\u201cWe will work with both the Bar and the Bench to defend the electoral process in the best interest of our democracy. By the same token, as Chairmen and leaders of political parties, you have a role to play. I wish to remind you that INEC is both an umpire and a regulator.\n\n\u201cThe commission is an umpire in dealing even-handedly with political parties collectively, but when it comes to the management of intra-party affairs, it is a regulator. We will play our role decisively,\u201d he said.\n\nAnambra election\n\nOn the Anambra election, the INEC chairman said, \u201cToday (Monday) it is exactly two months (or 60 days) to the election. As you are aware, the Commission devolved the CVR to the 326 Registration Areas (or Wards) in addition to the 21 Local Government offices and the State Office of the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe physical exercise was suspended yesterday (Sunday) i.e. 60 days to the election as required by Section 9(5) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). However, the online pre-registration option will continue to be available but no appointment for completion of registration can be scheduled until after the election.\n\n\u201cThe commission will use the next few weeks to compile the register of voters for claims and objections, clean up the data, print the PVCs for collection by registrants and compile the register for each of the 5,720 polling units in the State.\n\n\u201cI want to assure every newly registered voter in Anambra state, including those who applied to transfer from within and outside the state or for the replacement of damaged or lost PVCs that their cards will be printed and made available to them for collection before the election.\n\n\u201cEach political party fielding candidates in the election will be given a copy of the voters\u2019 register on 7th October 2021 as published in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the elections.\u201d\n\nOn new technology, Yakubu said the commission must keep pace with the ever-changing world of global information and communication technology.\n\nHe said the functionality of the Z-pad has now been integrated into the IVED currently used for voter registration, adding that on election day, the same device would used for the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for fingerprint authentication during accreditation and where it fails for facial authentication.\n\n\u201cWhile working on the register of voters, the commission has also been continuously innovating on how to strengthen the credibility of voter accreditation and result management during elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs always, the deployment of appropriate technology is crucial and desirable. The introduction of the machine-readable PVC combined and Smart Card Reader (SCR) were important innovations. So too is the uploading of polling unit results in real-time on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that technology always advances with the passage of time. Consequently, the Commission must keep pace with the ever-changing world of global information and communication technology. We are at one such crossroad at the moment.\n\n\u201cFor some time, many stakeholders, including leaders of political parties, have called on the Commission to strengthen the voter accreditation process during elections, especially with reference to the use of incident form where the SCR fails to authenticate the fingerprints of a voter.\n\n\u201cSuch concern is legitimate given the fact that the SCR successfully verifies any card that belongs to the polling unit for which it is configured irrespective of who presents it. Their apprehension, therefore, is that using the incident form to cover those whose fingerprints are not authenticated by the SCR, a voter may be able to use another person\u2019s PVC to vote during an election.\n\n\u201cTo address this concern, the Commission attempted to introduce the facial biometric authentication during accreditation of the voters using the Z-Pad tablet to complement the fingerprint process through the Card Reader before the Edo Governorship election in September 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Commission was not entirely satisfied with the pilot held in the Nasarawa Central State Constituency bye-election a month earlier in August 2020. We therefore suspended the idea to enable us to do some more work.\n\n\u201cOver the last one year, we reviewed the situation and we think we have found the appropriate technology to address it. The Z-pad was therefore only used to upload Polling Unit results to the IReV portal during elections.\n\n\u201cThe functionality of the Z-pad has now been integrated into the IVED currently used for voter registration. On Election Day, the same device will used for the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for fingerprint authentication during accreditation and where it fails for facial authentication.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this multi-layer process will eliminate the possibility of voting by identity theft using another person\u2019s PVC. Where the voter fails both the fingerprint and facial authentication, he/she will not be allowed to vote.\n\n\u201cIn other words, no electronic authentication, no voting. We are convinced that the new machine is robust enough to further guarantee the credibility of voter authentication and transparent management of results during elections.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the commission intends to carry out a pilot exercise using the new device in Delta state during the Isoko South 1 State Assembly constituency bye-election holding this weekend (Saturday 11th September 2021).\n\n\u201cThe BVAS will now perform the functions of both the SCR and Z-Pad in the bye-election. Thereafter, it will be deployed in the Anambra Governorship election in November. There will be a presentation of the new device and a practical demonstration of its functions to Chairmen and leaders of political parties at this meeting,\u201d Yakubu told the meeting.",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

          "text": "Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari says with the recent activities of bandits and information now at his disposal, he wouldn\u2019t have granted amnesty to bandits as he did years back.\n\nThe governor in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today insists that he doesn\u2019t regret his action but previous efforts in 2016 and 2019 have obviously not yielded any positive result.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret it, the only thing I say is with the benefits of hindsight, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. Because at that time when we started in 2016, there were leaders but gradually all the leaders were eliminated, that was the failure of the first round,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cThe second round after the 2019 election didn\u2019t see the light of the day. We tried but then we realised that, \u2018who are you talking to?\u2019 They are not under the same umbrella. They are not pushing for any religious belief. They are just bandits, criminals, and thieves.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nGunmen Kidnap Wife, Children Of Katsina Lawmaker\n\nGunmen Strike Again In Katsina, Abduct Village Head\u2019s Four Children\n\nHe stressed that bandits posed great danger to society as their mission is to steal and kill and therefore they should be treated as criminals.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, there is nobody in the forest that can discuss peace. For me, anybody in the forest is a potential criminal, so I think it should be dealt with as such,\u201d he added.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAlso, during the interview, the governor hinted that his administration is considering banning open grazing in the state.\n\nHe, however, said that before a law banning (cattle) roaming is enacted, provisions would be made for where the animals would stay.\n\nTackling Banditry\n\nEarlier on Monday, the Governor inaugurated a committee charged with monitoring and enforcing the recently introduced executive order in the state and announced a ban on commercial charging of phones.\n\nThis according to the governor is part of efforts to tackle insecurity.\n\nGovernor Masari believes that the latest measure, coupled with further collaborations with the Federal Ministry of Communications will drastically reduce the menace of banditry in the north-western state.\n\n\u201cThe latest instruction that we gave out is the closure of all commercial charging points in the most affected local government areas. Commercial charging, we believe, is also an area which is helping the bandits to acquire means of communication,\u201d he said.\n\nKatsina is one of the states hit the most by the activities of bandits. Over the months, many residents, especially in villages, have been attacked, kidnapped or killed.\n\nOver the weekend, the younger sister of the Deputy Speaker of the Katsina State House of Assembly, Dalhatu Tafoki was kidnapped.\n\nAlso in the early hours of Monday, gunmen stormed Sabuwar Kasa village in Kafur Local Government Area and took away four children of the Village Head.",

          "text": "Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly on Monday committed an anti-open grazing bill to the Committee on Agriculture after it scaled second reading.\n\nThe House also read for the first and second time, the state\u2019s Value-Added Tax bill and asked the Committee on Finance handling it to report back on Thursday.\n\nSpeaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, described the \u2018Prohibition of Open Cattle Grazing Bill\u2019 as timely and one that would ensure harmonious relationships between herders and farmers and protect the environment of the state and the South West.\n\nHe suggested that the bill should make provision for the registration of herders and prepare them for ranching.\n\n\u201cAllocating parcel of land is not enough but there should be a training of those who would go into ranching,\u201d said Obasa who admitted that ranching was expensive and required adequate preparation.\n\nSpeaking about the bill on VAT, he expressed hopes that it would lead to an \u201cincrease in revenue and increase in infrastructural development. This is in line with fiscal federalism that we have been talking about\u201d.\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) had lost its bid at a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt to stop the Rivers State Government from collecting VAT.\n\nJustice Stephen Dalyop Pam who refused the application held that the revenue agency failed to file an application to set aside the tax law recently enacted by the Rivers State House of Assembly and signed by Governor Wike on August 19, therefore, the state law on VAT was valid and subsisting.\n\nIn his reaction, Obasa who believes the court decision affects all states, is hopeful that when passed, the VAT law would help the Lagos State Government to tackle the challenges in its various sectors.\n\nHe urged the government to do everything legally possible to ensure the judgement of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, is sustained even up to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe lawmaker decried a situation where about N500 billion was generated from Lagos State while N300 billion was generated from other south-west states, but paltry amounts were disbursed to them in return.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity for us to emphasise again on the need for the consideration of true federalism,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the speaker\u2019s remarks, some members of the house \u2013 Bisi Yusuff, Kehinde Joseph, Olumoh Lukeman, Gbolahan Yishawu, Tobun Abiodun, David Setonji, Adedamola Kasunmu, Rasheed Makinde, and Sanni Okanlawon, made various contributions.\n\nWhile reacting to the bill on open grazing, Yusuff lamented the havoc that herdsmen had caused in the South West, saying farmers have continuously become afraid to visit their farms, leading to a shortage of food.\n\nHe also said many farmers had become indebted as they now find it difficult to pay back loans they secured, stressing that it was lamentable that cattle roam the streets, causing accidents and harassing people.\n\nWhile the lawmaker advocated stiffer penalties for herders caught carrying firearms, his position was supported by Joseph who said open grazing in the 21st century was an aberration.\n\nJoseph said the bill would ensure peaceful coexistence, reduce crime, and help to guide the activities of herders, while Lukeman suggested that the high courts should be made to handle cases from the enforcement of the bill when passed, or that the state should establish special courts for such purpose.",

          "text": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says he welcomes the decision to release his predecessor Jacob Zuma on medical parole, a decision taken just days before the resumption of the corruption trial of the former head of state that has provoked the anger of the opposition.\n\n\u201cWe welcome this. We\u2019ve heard that he is not well and we\u2019d like to wish him quick recovery as he\u2019s restored back to his home to be with his loved ones,\u201d President Ramaphosa said during his concluding remarks at a national executive committee meeting of the governing African National Congress (ANC).\n\nThe 79-year-old Zuma had been jailed since July 8 for contempt of court but has been hospitalized for the past month \u2013 for undisclosed reasons \u2013 outside the prison where he began serving a 15-month sentence.\n\nHe was convicted of repeatedly refusing to appear before a commission investigating state corruption during his presidency (2009-2018).\n\nOn Sunday, prison authorities announced that the ex-president could return home from the hospital but was likely to have to perform community service.\n\nThe announcement, which coincided with a summit meeting of the ANC, where Jacob Zuma still has many supporters, is \u201cextremely suspicious,\u201d John Steenhuisen of the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) told AFP. \u201cThis decision is political, not medical,\u201d he said.\n\nCyril Ramaphosa has made the fight against corruption a key issue, especially within the ANC. But the head of state has difficulty establishing his authority within the party, caught up in a war of factions.\n\nThis latest twist in Mr Zuma\u2019s legal travails proves that \u201cwhen you have political connections, prison is not the place for you,\u201d says Mmusi Maimane of the advocacy group One South Africa.\n\nOpposition parties and groups are demanding that the authorities publicly disclose the steps in the process that led to his release on parole.\n\nThe circumstances in which this decision was taken \u201care not only deeply suspicious but do not comply with the procedure laid down by law,\u201d the De Klerk Foundation said in a statement.\n\nFor the opposition group ActionSA, it is rather the result of \u201ca criminal justice system that treats the most powerful with gloves and allows them to escape justice.\n\nZuma\u2019s corruption trial is due to resume on Thursday. \u201cIt would not be surprising if this medical parole is now a pretext to say he is not fit to stand trial,\u201d Naidoo said.\n\nIn the 20-year-old case, the former president is accused of taking bribes from the French arms giant Thales, which is also charged with corruption and money laundering. He faces 16 counts of fraud, corruption and racketeering.",

Alpha Conde had only been re-elected for a third presidential term last November. The military has not revealed a broader plan for governing the country, other than an announcement to replace regional governors with military commanders.\n\nSome fear that the coup will mark the return of military rule to Guinea, a country that\u2019s no stranger to volatility.\n\n\u201cIf this situation continues, the army may return to power, because everything was already planned.

          "text": "Guinean government officials are barred from leaving the country until further notice and a curfew imposed in mining areas has been lifted, the leader of an army unit that overthrew President Alpha Conde has said.\n\nOn Monday Colonel Mamadi Doumbouya \u2013 a former French legionnaire officer \u2013 told a gathering of Conde\u2019s ministers, including the prime minister and top government officials, that they should also hand back their official vehicles.\n\n\u201cThere will be no witch-hunt,\u201d he said a day after the coup which drew international condemnation and threats of sanctions.\n\nThe takeover in the West African nation that holds the world\u2019s largest bauxite reserves, an ore used to produce aluminium, sent prices of the metal sky-rocketing to a 10-year high on Monday over fears of further supply disruption in the downstream market. There was no indication of such disruption yet.\n\nLight traffic resumed, and some shops reopened around the main administrative district of Kaloum in the capital, Conakry which witnessed heavy gunfire throughout Sunday as the special forces battled soldiers loyal to Conde. A military spokesman said on television that land air borders had also been reopened.\n\nHowever, uncertainty remains. While the army unit appeared to have Conde in detention, telling the West African nation on state television that they had dissolved the government and constitution, other branches of the army are yet to publicly comment.\n\nDoumbouya said on state television on Sunday that \u201cpoverty and endemic corruption\u201d had driven his forces to remove Conde from office.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Nicolas Haque, reporting from Dakar in neighbouring Senegal, called Monday\u2019s meeting an \u201cincredible scene\u201d as the country\u2019s powerful figures were brought inside the national parliament to be summoned by the new leader.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting in this scene is that he was there to both reassure them and threaten them,\u201d Haque said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, he said\u2026 \u2018No one\u2019s going to go after you, but we will take your vehicles, your passports, so that you do not run away from the country. The borders are open. The airport is not closed,\u2019 trying to reassure both the international actors who have been condemning this coup but also trying to reassure the Guinean population.\n\n\u201cHe calls for a national unity government but he hasn\u2019t given any timeline to when he\u2019s going do that and what framework that\u2019s gonna operate.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Kwesi Aning of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre told Al Jazeera the coup leaders in Guinea have a short window to enact any change.\n\n\u201cThe window for change to take place is very short. The demographics of Guinea and the Sahel and West African states are such that people are losing patience. The military regime have no more than 6-12 months \u2013 that is if they will have that length of time \u2013 to govern, to demonstrate.\n\n\u201cThe optimism with which Conde was voted into power in 2010 has totally fizzled out,\u201d Aning said.\n\nThe coup has met condemnation from some of Guinea\u2019s strongest allies. The United Nations quickly denounced the takeover, and both the African Union and West Africa\u2019s regional bloc have threatened sanctions.\n\nIn an overnight statement, the US Department of State said that violence and extra-constitutional measures could erode Guinea\u2019s prospects for stability and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThese actions could limit the ability of the United States and Guinea\u2019s other international partners to support the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nRegional experts said, however, that unlike in landlocked Mali, where neighbours and partners were able to pressure the military government after a coup, leverage on the military in Guinea could be limited because it is not landlocked, also because it is not a member of the West African currency union.\n\nAlthough mineral wealth has fuelled economic growth during Conde\u2019s reign, few citizens significantly benefitting, contributing to pent-up frustration among millions of jobless youths.",
