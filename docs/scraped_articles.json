          "title": "Nigeria must embrace renewable energy now \u2013 Reps",
          "text": "The House of Representatives has said Nigeria must begin to adopt other sources of energy as the world is shifting from fossil fuel to cleaner, renewable energy. It also stated the need for the country to have a national policy on energy, which drives the power and petroleum sectors.\n\nThis was made known in Abuja on Wednesday at a public hearing organised by the House Committee on Science and Technology on three bills seeking to amend the Amend Energy Commission of Nigeria Act and create a National Renewable Energy Development Agency.\n\nOne of the legislation is titled, \u2018A Bill for an Act to Amend Energy Commission of Nigeria Act (Cap E10, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004) to Strengthen and to Make it the National Focal Point for New and Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Conservation and Establish the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Fund for Related Matters.\u2019\n\nThe second legislation is titled, \u2018A Bill for an Act to Amend the Energy Commission of Nigeria Act, Cap E10 Lfn, 2004 to Make it Compulsory for the Federal Government Through the Commission to Harness, Explore and Utilise Other Sources of Energy Other Than the Hydro and Gas Energy Sources in Nigeria and for Related Matters.\u2019\n\n\u2018A Bill for an Act to Establish the National Renewable Energy Development Agency (Establishment) Bill, 2020\u2019 is the third legislation presented.\n\nSpeaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, while declaring the hearing open, noted that the bills, individually and collectively, seek to change the national approach to energy generation with the specific intent of ensuring that we embrace renewable energy options as a matter of national policy.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by the Deputy Majority Leader, Peter Akpatason, said, \u201cIf we succeed in our present objectives, we have an opportunity to improve energy generation in our country whilst at the same time growing the economy in ways that will provide jobs and create economic opportunities for our citizens.\n\n\u201cHowever, our ability to do any of these depends on how well we can collaborate, first to ensure that the Bills that emerge from this process are well thought out, effectively written and capable of meeting the intended objectives. It also depends on our ability to ensure that the mandates of this Bill are implemented effectively by those to whom we will assign different responsibilities in the final legislation.\u201d\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, Beni Lar, in her welcome address, also noted that the bills independently and collectively recognise the urgent shift in global energy need and in different ways seek to proffer solutions to prioritising cleaner renewable energy sources.\n\nLar said, \u201cIn 2015, the United Nation, of which Nigeria is a signatory, adopted 17 goals themed \u2018Sustainable Development Goals,\u2019 one of which is Affordable Clean Energy. Following the adoption of SDGs, the global energy focus has shifted from carbon fuels to cleaner renewable sources and the implications are far reaching.\n\n\u201cPertinent is to note that in the near future, carbon fuel will not be attractive as it has been. On the brighter side, Nigeria is abundantly blessed with other cleaner renewable energy sources. May I unequivocally state that the potential of renewable energy is enormous and capable of huge employment generation among our teeming youths, foreign exchange earnings, boosting economic growth and diversification, which is a major thrust of this administration, etc., when properly harnessed and managed.\u201d\n\nLar warned that Nigeria might be stranded in about 30 years as the country is heavily dependent on fossil fuel for energy and revenue.\n\nThe lawmaker stated that the hearing was crucial to national development, particularly in the face of the global dwindling prospect of carbon fuel, urgent need to provide an enabling environment for youth engagement, global competitiveness, among others.\n\nShe said, \u201cAs a nation, we missed the opportunities of slave trade, colonisation and industrial revolution but can\u2019t afford to toy with the prospects of renewable energy. Together, we can do better.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all the stakeholders to participate actively in the discussion, be as objective as possible and consider the interest of the nation first. I assure you all that the House will critically harmonise all the arguments for the benefit of the nation.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Thursday has granted the bail application of a former Registrar of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof Adedibu Ojerinde.\n\nThe court granted him bail in the sum of N200 million with two sureties in like sum.\n\nAccording to bail terms, one surety must be a professor in a Federal University and the other must be a property owner in Abuja. The court also stated that their residences must be verified.\n\nThe court also ordered that Ojerinde must deposit his passport with the court registrar.\n\nThe matter was adjourned to July 22 and 23 for trial.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu made the order after the court resumed sitting to rule on the bail application after the case was stood down a second time.\n\nThe court had stood down the matter the first time after it was called up but Ojerinde was not yet produced in court for the hearing of his bail.\n\nThe Prosecution lawyer, Ebenezer Shogunle, informed the court that Ojerinde was on his way to court but was delayed by traffic.\n\nShogunle applied to the court to stand down the matter until Ojerinde makes it to court.\n\nThe Defense Counsel, Peter Olorunnishola (SAN), was not opposed to the application. Thus, the court stood down the matter and proceeded to take other cases on the cause list.\n\nAfter the court had concluded with other matters listed for the day, Ojerinde was still not in court.\n\nJustice Egwuatu, who was displeased with the situation, admonished the parties that the court sits by 9 in the morning and they should ensure they are in the court on time.\n\nConsequently, the court had to rise.\n\nWhen Ojerinde was eventually brought to court, the court resumed sitting.\n\nOjerinde, who was looking frail, was supported to the dock as it appeared he could not walk unaided.\n\nOjerinde\u2019s lawyer, Olorunnishola moved his motion praying the court to grant his client bail. He moved the motion in terms of the motion paper.\n\nThe Prosecution\u2019s lawyer, Shogunle, opposed the bail application. He argued that while Ojerinde was in their custody, they granted him administrative bail, but that he breached it.\n\nShogunle pointed the court to paragraph 5 (e, f, g) of his counter-affidavit.\n\nHe also asserted that other investigations were still ongoing and the witnesses in the investigations were subject to the influence of Ojerinde.\n\nHe also argued that the claim of ill-health which Ojerinde was relying on as a ground for the bail application was not supported by a medical report.\n\nOjerinde\u2019s lawyer responded that they have filed their reply to the prosecution\u2019s counter-affidavit and also added that the prosecution had concluded their investigation which was why they had charged Ojerinde to court.\n\nRecall that Justice Obiora Egwuatu on Tuesday had ordered that the former JAMB boss, Ojerinde, be remanded in prison pending the hearing of his bail application.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu gave the order after the former JAMB boss was arraigned on an 18-count bordering on alleged fraud and diversion of public funds to the tune of N5.2 billion.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/97/2021, Ojerinde was alleged to have committed the offence during his time as the Registrar of the National Examination Council and JAMB.\n\nWhile taking his plea, Ojerinde had pleaded not guilty.",

          "text": ".\n\nincluding 46000 vulnerable people By Ibrahim Wuyo, Kaduna\n\nA total of 400, 000 Kaduna citizens from across the 23 Local Government Areas have been enrolled into the Kaduna Contributory Health Management Authority (KADCHMA) scheme.\n\nThis was disclosed during a meeting titled: \u201cPartnership to Engage, Reform and Learn (Perl) and Lafiya Programme Interaction with Kaduna State Accountability Mechanism (KADMAN) and KADCHMA on Strategies for Contributory Health Care Enrollment\u201d, held in Kaduna.\n\nThe scheme was passed into law in 2018 by the Kaduna State government to provide health care services to the residents at very subsidised rates and qualitative manner.\n\nDr Juliana Dauda B, Head Operations Department, KADCHMA said in an interview that about 46,000 vulnerable people have also been enrolled into the scheme from across the 23 LGAs.\n\nShe said that the passing into law of the scheme in 2018 led to the establishment of KADCHMA, with the mandate of delivering and operating the contributory health scheme itself.\n\nAccording to her, \u201d right from the inception, since it was established, we\u2019ve followed through on our key mandate and have been able to enrol a total of over 400,000 currently released to the scheme from the formal sectors, informal and vulnerable components of the population of Kaduna state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the state has over 250 healthcare providers, both primary and secondary and public and private providing services for this scheme across the 23 LGAs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently every Ward in each LGA of the state has at least one facility providing services for the enrollee which met service provision of equitable access for service provisions for citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause one of the hindrances to qualify access to services is the availability of those facilities to the proximity, close to where people are residing. So we\u2019ve been able to identify this facility and have been able to accredit them and certify them with the necessary tools to provide the service\u201d, she said.\n\nDr.Juliana called on residents of the state to avail themselves of the scheme for the huge benefits they stand to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling on everybody, not only civil servants. It\u2019s meant for residents of Kaduna state, civil servants from formal and informal sectors, private, traders, artisans, others, because they\u2019re entitled to the scheme which provides robust services in a very subsidised way in a very qualitative manner, and sustained as well.\n\n\u201cThe law state that it\u2019s mandatory for everybody who is resident n Kaduna state to key into the scheme. We\u2019re still working on the enforcement strategy to key into it. We\u2019re working with relevant agencies and organisations to enforce the law in the near future. Every Kaduna civil servant has been registered. \u201c\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are excited about the scheme but some have reservations about the scheme in terms of newness, people are sceptical in joining the scheme on sustainability, the premium goes by the economic status of most people. \u201c\n\n\u201cBecause the premium for an individual is N10, 650 per annum, and for the family plan, a family of 6 is N57,950 per annum. So one of the challenges or the constraint to the take-up of these two by the informal sector is the premium itself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever we\u2019re looking at how to create a flexible package that fits, to some extent, what individuals and families can afford so long as services will be reached for people coming into it .\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernment, right from the inception committed itself to funding health care services for the vulnerable in the state. it committed one per cent of all its consolidated revenue funds into paying for service under the scheme for the vulnerable in the State. \u201c\n\n\u201cSo currently we have been able to enrol about 46000 vulnerable into the scheme across the 23 LGAs. We\u2019ve identified them using key criteria. We\u2019ve people that are above 65yesrs, people with disability, pregnant women that fall within the economic circle and can\u2019t afford maternal health care, and children under five years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are basically the categories of vulnerable government can take care of. And the government has been so committed to funding and has been releasing the funds consistently right from 2020 when the scheme started. The criteria used is well spelt out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the facilities providing the services under the scheme are effective and have been accredited, inspected, accessed and certified\u201d, she said.\n\nEarlier, the issues bothering on the state of the facilities, the designated health providers, awareness on strategies to improve the informal sector, were thoroughly discussed and decisions arrived on how to embark on advocacies.",

          "text": "By Rotimi Ojomoyela\n\nEXCEPT something urgent is done to arrest the dangerous trend, Ekiti State is fast becoming a feasting zone for kidnappers, as men of the underworld no longer operate on lonely or deserted roads, neither do they limit their scope to those who walk in dark alleys or stay late out from the safety of their homes.\n\n\n\nThey go after their victims, anyway, anyhow with reckless abandon.\n\n\n\nPeople are being kidnapped from their homes and taken to unknown destinations, traditional rulers and their hallowed palaces have been desecrated.\n\n\n\nOn the 14th of April, 2021, unknown gunmen stormed the palace of Obadun of Ilemeso-Ekiti, Oba David Oyewumi and without any respect for the traditional ruler, dragged him out of his throne into a waiting car.\n\n\n\nThey made away with him to an unknown destination, the traditional ruler spent four days in the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\n\n\nIlemeso-Ekiti is a neighbouring town to Isan and five minutes drive away from the country home of Governor Kayode Fayemi in Oye Local Government Area of the state.\n\n\n\nThe suspected kidnappers, armed with dangerous weapons, scaled the fence of the palace, sent the people who were in the palace to pay obeisance to the Obadun into different directions as they rent the air with gunfire.\n\n\n\nSources disclosed that the kidnappers, after gaining entrance into the palace, went straight to the bungalow housing the monarch and his family members.\n\n\n\nBarely 23 days after the abduction of Obadun of Ilemeso-Ekiti; the Elewu of Ewu-Ekiti, Oba Adetutu Ajayi, in Ilejemeje Local Government Area of the state, was shot by suspected gunmen while returning from a journey to his hometown.\n\n\n\nThe monarch escaped by the whiskers from the scene but had gunshot injuries and was hospitalised in a private hospital in Ado-Ekiti for two weeks before being flown out of the state by members of his family for further medical attention.\n\n\n\nThe monarch, on a fateful day before the incident, was travelling in his official car to the neighbouring Ayetoro Ekiti in Ido/Osin Local Government when the gunmen waved him down and started raining bullets on his car.\n\n\n\nThe bullets which rattled his car also hit him on the legs, arms and stomach.\n\nAnother ugly incident that confirmed the thinking in some quarters that traditional rulers in the state are fast becoming a soft target of kidnappers in recent times was the abduction of Eleda of Eda-Ile in Ekiti East Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Oba Benjamin Adeniran Osho.\n\n\n\nOba Adeniran Osho was said to have been kidnapped in the presence of his only wife while returning from their farm at Eda-Ile, after a heavy downpour in the area.\n\n\n\nBarely 24 hours after the abduction of the monarch, a source who craved anonymity told journalists in Ado Ekiti that the monarch and the wife would have been kidnapped, but for pleading made by the traditional ruler.\n\n\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe Oba and his wife went to a farm and were accosted by these gunmen on their way back home. The two would have been kidnapped, but the monarch begged the bandits to free his wife, which they did.\n\n\n\n\u201cN2 million ransom was raised by the family to secure the release of the monarch after spending several days at the kidnappers\u2019 den.\u201d\n\n\n\nMonarchs now target of kidnappers\u2014Oba Alabi\n\nShortly after the release of the monarch was secured, the chairman, Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers, Oba Olabanji Alabi, the Alawe of Ilawe issued a release to lament on the level of insecurity in Ekiti State and the country at large.\n\n\n\nThe first-class monarch who lamented over the situation, however, charged the government to redouble its effort by improving on the security architecture in the state.\n\n\n\nThe traditional ruler also led some of his colleagues to the office of the Deputy Governor of the state in company of the chairman of Oye Local Government, Mr. Foluso Ojo, to seek the government\u2019s support for improved security in their domains.\n\n\n\nThe monarch particularly made mention of his members who were recently abducted by kidnappers in their palaces and those accosted on the road as worrisome and called on the federal and state governments to intensify effort in ensuring the security of lives and property in the state.\n\n\n\nThe Onisan of Isan Ekiti, Oba Ayodele Adejuwon, said there is need for deployment of more security personnel to carry out a sustained and coordinated show of force in communities in the state.\n\n\n\nOba Adejuwon drew the government\u2019s attention to challenges facing the Police and Civil Defence formations in the state especially the lack of operational vehicles which have made the Obas engage the services of local hunters.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the Oloye of Oye Ekiti, Oba Oluwole Ademolaju, and the Alafon of Ilafon Ekiti, Oba Akin Owoeye asked the government to identify the black spots used by suspected kidnappers across the state to be busted as early as possible to nip criminality in the bud.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re collaborating with security agencies \u2014Ekiti govt\n\nResponding, the Deputy Governor of the state, Mr. Bisi Egbeyemi, expressed the readiness of the Ekiti State Government to collaborate with security agencies to comb forests and other dark spots in a renewed bid to tackle kidnapping and other criminal activities in the state.\n\n\n\nWhile sympathising with the royal fathers on the kidnap of their colleagues, the Deputy Governor emphasized that the government, security agencies and residents have much to do with intelligence gathering and consciousness on the movement of strange people in their localities.\n\n\n\nOn his part, the Owa Ooye of Okemesi Ekiti, Oba Adedeji Gbadebo, suggested the use of traditional African medicine to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nThe monarch, who described the traditional method as the only alternative way to curb insecurity in the country, explained that Nigerians have so long abandoned the use of traditional charms and African traditional power, the move which he described as the main cause of the rise in insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nIn another kidnap saga, a farmer Mr. Josiah Isah was kidnapped in the presence of his family on his farm along Ikere/Ise road.\n\n\n\nThe kidnappers told the family to go home and look for money to secure the release of the farmer.\n\n\n\nThe family of the farmer was said to have raised N800,000 before they could release the farmer.\n\n\n\nAside from those mentioned above, other prominent figures who have suffered the same fate in the hands of kidnappers are the wife of the late Auditor-General of the state, Mrs. Funmilola Osalusi; former Ekiti Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Folorunso Olabode, an Ekiti West councillor, an aide to the Speaker of Ekiti State House of Assembly and so many others.\n\n\n\nWere raiding black spots, combing forests\u2014Police\n\nWhile speaking on the matter, the Ekiti State Police Command, regretted the various incidents, despite the rigorous joint patrol, raiding of black spots and combing of forests by its men to dislodge criminals.\n\n\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Babatunde Mobayo said he had issued a directive that the combined forces of Police, Amotekun Corps, Vigilante groups, local hunters, chiefs, drivers union, motorcycle riders, farmers and other stakeholders should carry out a joint operation being diligently observed simultaneously across the 16 local government areas before the gunmen struck.\n\n\n\nMobayo said: \u201cSome unknown gunmen mischievously defied the operation, came out and attacked the Elewu of Ewu, Oba Adetutu Ajayi while he was on transit between Ewu-Ekiti and Ayetoro-Ekiti at about 1900hrs.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, it appeared that efforts of the security agencies in the state are beginning to yield fruits with the arrest and parade of suspected kidnappers, who were students of a privately-owned Polytechnic in Odo-Ekiti, a suburb of Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO of the command, Mr. Sunday Abutu, an Assistant Superintendent of Police ASP, they were arrested by the officers of Rapid Respond Squad, RSS, attached to the command following the abduction of one Akiode Akinyemi who is also a student of the polytechnic.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Press Secretary to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, has said that the governor was not averse to the zoning of the governorship of the state contrary to insinuations in some quarters.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at Government House, Asaba, on Thursday, Ifeajika said that it was also not true that the governor came to power through zoning consensus as being canvassed by some highly-placed Deltans.\n\nHe said that it was imperative to put the records straight in order not to mislead Deltans and other Nigerians.\n\nREAD ALSO:How we recovered 43 oil wells from Rivers \u2014 Imo govt\n\nAccording to him, there is an insinuation making the rounds; ordinarily one wouldn\u2019t have bothered to talk about it but because it\u2019s coming from very highly-placed persons, there is a need to put the records straight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true that the Governor of this state, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, is opposed to zoning, particularly for the governorship of this state.\n\n\u201cThe times he spoke, it was loud and clear. He said that God will help Deltans to determine who will take over from him.\n\n\u201cBut even at that, he told Deltans that at the right time, the leadership of the PDP will sit down to decide who the governor will be and after that, leave it to God to decide ultimately as he cannot play the role of God.\n\n\u201cThat has been his position; so, it\u2019s not true that the governor is opposed to power moving to Delta Central or any other senatorial district for that matter,\u201d Ifeajika said.\n\nHe further said that the insinuations making the rounds that the governor came to power through zoning were wrong because people from other senatorial districts participated in the primaries that brought him to power.\n\nHe said that there was no time in the history of the state that any primary for the governorship was allowed as an exclusive preserve of any senatorial district.\n\n\u201cThe insinuation that it was through zoning that Okowa became governor is also wrong. We are all witnesses to the primaries that brought him to power, persons from the other senatorial districts in the state other than Delta North, participated in the exercise.\n\n\u201cThere was no time in the state, particularly in this present dispensation that any primary for governorship has been allowed to be for only one particular senatorial district.\n\n\u201cIn all the records we have, primaries had been for all comers; people from all the senatorial districts always participated in all of that.\n\n\u201cFor the one that brought Okowa to power in 2015, we are aware that aspirants from Central and South Senatorial Districts participated, including a former minister who has become an apostle of zoning and saying that zoning consensus brought Governor Okowa to power.\n\n\u201cIndeed, former Chief of Staff, Olorogun David Edevbie, came second in that race, meaning that if he had come first, there was no way they would have asked him to stay away and allow Okowa to grab the ticket on the grounds that it was the turn of Delta North to produce the governor.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it is not true that it was zoning that brought Okowa to power, it was his person, his pedigree in politics, and the grace of God. He also had, as he still does, immense goodwill across the three senatorial districts.\n\n\u201cSo, what we are praying for and also asking Deltans to do is that everybody should come together and at the right time, the leadership of PDP will come together and decide who the successor to Governor Okowa will be, and of course, they will be guided by God as the governor himself, had said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do; so, the insinuation that the governor is opposed to the next governorship candidate coming from a particular place is untrue and it is important to put that record straight,\u201d Ifeajika stated.\n\nOn the defection of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its effect on PDP\u2019s performance, the CPS dismissed the move, saying that it would not have any impact on PDP\u2019s dominance in the state.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of democracy is that people are allowed to move to any party they like. The movement of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi does not translate to the dominance of APC in Delta.\n\n\u201cYes, Nwaoboshi has gone to APC but I can tell you that the impact of his defection cannot rattle PDP in this state. Delta is a PDP\n\nState and will remain so.\n\n\u201cThat APC now has two senators does not translate to it being able to take Delta in elections; they cannot win one-twentieth of Delta electorate,\u201d he added.",

          "text": ".\n\nA pan Ndokwa Socio-political pressure group, Organised Ndokwa Effort, ONE, has in very strong terms rejected the allocation of 3% to oil and gas bearing communities in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB by the National Assembly saying, the people of Ndokwa nation will not accept anything less than 10% noting, that the host communities are the ones bearing the brunt of oil exploration directly and that compensation should be commensurate with the adverse effects.\n\nThis was made known in a communique signed by the duo of the Chairman and Coordinator: Okei Ossai Udom and Svt.\n\nRodney Odibe Odili-Obi respectively, issued at the end of a well-attended meeting of the leadership and members of the group including critical stakeholders in the Ndokwa project at the Ndokwa House, Abuja, Thursday.\n\nThe statement commended President Muhammadu Buhari, on his efforts towards building a new Nigeria in his \u201cvisionary leadership\u201d geared towards granting financial autonomy for the Judiciary and also an independent Local Government administration in the country a development the group maintained will breed growth, accountability, responsibility and massive human and material development to the grassroot.\n\nHowever, the group laments the insecurity of lives and properties in the country stressing that the president should up his game to protect Nigerians noting that, that is one of the major social contracts binding the citizens and government.\n\nThe group averred that: the Petroleum Industry Bill as recently passed by the legislature is unsatisfactory, just as the overstretched insecurity and perceived widespread injustice, has resulted in a public outcry for a national consensual constitution and based on the mantra of \u2018Ndokwa First\u2019 the group noted that, crude oil was discovered in their land in 1962 while its production started in 1965 saying, the future of Nigeria\u2019s economy depends on the enormous Natural Gas resource production across the Ndokwa land which group said, has more than 10Trillion cubic feet making Ndokwa land the single largest deposit of Natural Gas concentrate in the entire West African sub-region that can support major IPP and LNG projects, and host many critical infrastructures, especially in relation to the supply of Gas to the various multimillion US Dollar Gas Pipeline projects.\n\n\u201cNdokwa creeks, lowland and upland areas have a cumulative Oil production capacity of over 380 million Stock Tank Barrels (STB). The potential Crude Oil production across the Ndokwa land is 150,000 barrels per day (bpd). The contributors to this production quantum include Kwale 75,000 bpd, Afor-Obetim (10,000 bpd), Okpai (10,000 bpd), Aboh/Abalagana (10,000 bpd), Emu/Obodougwa (6,000bpd), Ebedei/Umutu (5,000 bpd), Onitcha Ukwuani (2,000 bpd), with additional 35,700bpd production locked in, due to OPEC restriction, Downhole mechanical problems requiring work-overs amongst others.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads in part: That, the people of Ndokwa land had suffered and are still suffering without end, the hazards of the operations of Shell, NAOC, Total, Seplat, Platform Petroleum, Midwestern Oil and Gas, Energia, Chorus Energy, Sterling Global and Pillar Oil dating back to 1965.\n\nONE stressed further that: \u201cfor the avoidance of doubts, we state unequivocally without fear or trepidation our stand against the recommendation of PIB paltry 3% opex to the host communities because it is grossly insufficient to attenuate the sufferings of our people, and compensate the damage to our environment.\n\n\u201cWe demand nothing less than 10% and thus call on the National Assembly Conference of Committees to retract and revise the rate from 3% to 10%. First, to qualify as a Host Community, the subsurface below such a community must geologically bear oil and gas. No more no less.\n\nDrilling the several kilometres deep boreholes to produce the oil and gas to the surface comes with a high risk of blow out/fire, spillage, pollution, environmental degradation, land subsidence, strange ailment, increase in radioactivity and heavy metals in fishes, soils, streams, waters leading to low agricultural productivity and poverty.\n\n\u201cThe oil-producing communities trust fund, therefore, is justified for a share of profit or production in order to ameliorate the hardship imposed on the dwellers around the oil wells and production facilities.\n\nWe are also opposed to dedicating a whopping 30% from NNPC operation to explore for oil and gas at all costs in the Northern basins.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, the eight Basins of Chad, Gongola, Anambra, Sokoto, Dahomey, Bida and Benue Trough and Niger Delta Deep each is allocated 5% of the Profit for equity, making a total of 40% for a period of 7years. Exploration is a phase. This allocation cannot be forever. It has to be time-bound.\n\nThe enumerated pipeline route communities should in line with international best practices be adequately accommodated as Right of Way (RoW) compensations.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the traffic of Genco power and other commodities from the North to Southern destinations does not in any way make States on the traffic routes to be co-host communities.\n\nOn no account should the same pipeline route communities in Northern states transform by fiat to oil-bearing communities in order to take advantage of the Niger Delta?\n\nOur experience since 1960 has been regrettable. Our economic resources have been hugely exploited, yet our people and environment have largely been without benefits.\u201d The group stated in the presence of the mammoth crowd of Ndokwa people.\n\nPointedly, the Udom and Odili-Obi \u2013 led a group called on the President to consider Ndokwa nation in the constitution of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC board, in the appointment of federal ministers, heads of parastatals and agencies to give the Ndokwa man a sense of belonging and to also awake his national solidarity noting that: \u201cthe marginalisation of Ndokwa nation must stop.\u201d",

The southern governors had during the meeting agreed that the region should produce Nigeria\u2019s next president based on the principles of equity and fairness.\n\nReechoing the position, Zulum said: \u201cI have said it times without number that I, Professor Babagana Zulum, I am of the view that the presidency should go to the south in 2023 because the unity of our country is very important.\n\n\u201cSecondly, inclusivity is very important. Thirdly, I am in the APC. Six or seven years ago, APC had zoned the presidency to northern Nigeria based on the agreement that in the year 2023, the presidency should go to the south.\u201d\n\nZulum who appeared on a live television, yesterday, admitted that the southern leaders have the right to call for power shift to the region but faulted those insisting that the zone must produce the next Nigerian leader.\n\n\u201cBut again, this is politics. We are supposed to meet and discuss this issue among ourselves, among the political class,\u201d he explained, as he called for caution so as not to overheat the polity in the lead-up to the 2023 polls.\n\n\u201cThis statement that people are saying that the president must go to the south, I want them to remove the word must.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, NCGP called on political leaders from the six geopolitics zones to support presidential aspirants from the South East and North Central.\n\nIt also urged presidential aspirants who would be 60 years and above by 2023 to steer clear of the presidential quest in the region.\n\nThe leaders who addressed the media in Abuja, pegged the maximum age at 60 saying many Nigerians who held political power in the past were youths.\n\nBenjamin Sanni, Felix Tolorunju and Aisha Uju Okoye, who spoke for the group emphasised that the region and the South East have what it takes to govern Nigeria among her youthful population.\n\nThey said while the two regions were still asking all political parties and zones to cede the 2023 presidency to them, any aspirants older than 60 at the time of the quest should forget about the presidency Sani said the the legitimate agitation was anchored on the need for the region to have a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cWe have credible people who can deliver Nigeria from chaos, whatever and however it is. We are agitating for the Presidency to be zoned to North Central because our region is being marginalised.\n\n\u201cNorth Central will take Nigeria to where the country has been praying to get to. No matter the age bracket, we are agitating that a president from 60 years downward will deliver Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPeople who held power started at their tender age. So, anything above 60, forget about the Presidency, that is all I can tell Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Prof. Jonah Onuoha has said rotating of the Presidency between the north and the south is unwritten law that has been in practice since 1999.\n\nThe Head of Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), said the position of governors that in 2023 general elections the president of the country should come from the South was in line with the rotation of presidency in the country since 1999.\n\n\u201cIf you check the record, since 1999 the presidency has been rotating between the South and North. Rotating presidency is unwritten law that is in practice Nigeria since 1999. Anybody in Nigeria who wants to disrupt this rotation is not only unpatriotic but enemy of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOnuoha said the popular definition of democracy globally remains \u201cGovernment of the people, by the people and for the people.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col.Abubakar Umar (retd) has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of giving undue attention to leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, instead of focusing on deadly activities of bandits and kidnappers who are ravaging the country, particularly North West and North East regions.\n\nUmar in a statement in Kaduna said: \u201cActivities of those criminals have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 per cent of villages in North West and North East. Hundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom. Millions have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation.\u201d\n\nThe former military governor who faulted earlier claim by the Federal Government that it had defeated Boko Haram, saying it was an empty propaganda, decried the undue publicity given to seperatists agitators.\n\n\u201cThe recent rearrest of the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was greeted with a loud sigh of relief and celebration in some sections of the country. It also elicited congratulatory messages to the Federal government which appears overwhelmed by the intractable security challenges and in dire need of any redeeming act. This is clearly an exaggeration of the security threat Nnamdi Kanu and indeed IPOB pose to our nation\u2019s security and unity.\n\n\u201cIt is quite strange and disturbing that the Federal Government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cOver one thousand school children were abducted in the past eight months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments. Rape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities, particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East has turned out to be empty propaganda. Contrary to this claim,the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the North East.\u201d\n\nHe said for the average Northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him.\n\n\u201cIn recognizing or reasserting the right of every citizen or groups to express their desire for self determination, one does not support or condone the use of violence for such purpose. IPOB and its leader may well be responsible for some of the violence, including the murder of security personnel, arson and destruction of public and private properties for which they should be held to account. We must however be honest enough to identify the cause of the current growing restiveness in the South East. By all means government needs to deploy nonviolent means in addressing the problem. It is self-evident that justice, fairness and equity are the best means of building a united and virile nation, particularly one as diverse and fragile as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is my long held view that this country\u2019s is more beneficial to all the federating units, if only because it provides a security umbrella to all its units.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Parents of kidnapped pupils accuse Kaduna school of negligence\n\nEmma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has expressed concern over growing attacks on schoolchildren, as well as child abductions in Nigeria, with a call on authorities in the country to do more to ensure that children can safely live and go to school or fetch water without fear of being attacked or taken from their families.\n\nUNICEF, in a statement yesterday by its Executive Director, Ms. Henrietta Fore, lamented that no fewer than 950 students were abducted in Nigeria since December 2020.\n\nAlso, people whose children and wards were kidnapped from Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna on Monday, have accused the school authorities of complacency and negligence, for not taking action to beef up security around the premises, after receiving a threat letter from bandits planning to kidnap the pupils.\n\nUNICEF stated that over the past six weeks alone, nearly 500 children were abducted in four separate incidents in both the North-central and North-west, with many still in captivity.\n\nUNICEF said on July 5, 2020, 150 students were reportedly abducted from a school in Kaduna State, marking the latest incident in an alarming spate of attacks against children and abductions, including of students, in parts of West and Central Africa.\n\nFore added that such incidents appeared to be increasing in frequency, raising fears for the safety and well-being of the region\u2019s children.\n\nCiting the latest report of the United Nations Secretary-General on children and armed conflict, UNICEF said one in every three child victims of grave violations had been in West, and Central Africa.\n\nIt also highlighted the attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, DRC and Niger Republic.\n\nUNICEF said: \u201cMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the UN estimates that at least 950 students have been abducted from their schools by armed men since December. Over the past six weeks alone, nearly 500 children were abducted in four separate incidents across the central and North-west parts of the country. Many of these children have not yet been returned. It is hard to fathom the pain and fear that their families and loved ones are suffering in their absence.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to condemn these crimes, not when millions of children face a worsening protection crisis. Children living in these areas need concerted action to ensure that they can safely live and go to school or fetch water without fear of being attacked or taken from their families.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fore, non-state armed groups and all parties to conflict committing violations of children\u2019s rights \u2013 have a moral and legal obligation to immediately cease attacks against civilians and to respect and protect civilians and civilian objects during any military operations.\n\nFore also urged them not to impede but facilitate the efforts of UNICEF and other humanitarian actors working to reach vulnerable children.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe international community also has an important role to play. We need our donors to increase their contributions so that we can expand our work to reduce children\u2019s vulnerabilities and increase their resilience to keep them safe from harm. These efforts include creating safe temporary learning environments for children in areas where schools have been closed because of insecurity, providing psychosocial support to children affected by violence, and supporting education on mine risk awareness.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, every effort must be made to reverse the spiraling protection crisis for children as the region is on the brink of catastrophe.\u201d\n\nParents of kidnapped pupils accuse Kaduna school of negligence\n\nMeanwhile, people whose children and wards were kidnapped from Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna on Monday have accused the school authorities of complacency and negligence, for not taking action to beef up security around the premises, after receiving a threat letter from bandits, planning to kidnap the pupils.\n\nThe bandits, last Sunday, sent a threat letter to the school, announcing their plan to kidnap the pupils on Tuesday, but brought forward the timeline by a day when they kidnapped over 149 pupils, while 28 were said to have escaped.\n\nThe parents who formed different prayer groups in the school compound yesterday, called on God to intervene and protect their children and wards in captivity.\n\nThey said they had to go spiritual because they had lost confidence in the government in protecting lives and property.\n\nThey also blamed the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, for not doing enough to rescue kidnapped pupils.\n\nThey said the show of expression of concern by the state government and the federal government was not enough to bring back their children and wards.\n\nChairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Kaduna State Chapter, Rev. John Hayab, who spoke yesterday on ARISE NEWS Channels, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, confirmed that the pupils got a letter on Sunday from the bandits.\n\nAccording to him, the pupils showed the letter to their patron, who dismissed the threat letter and accused them of being unnecessarily afraid of writing their examinations that were supposed to start the next day.\n\nHe said the pupils also took the letter to the matron of the female students and got the same reaction from her.\n\nHe said: \u201cInstead of Tuesday, the bandits struck on Monday and kidnapped several students, which I see as negligence on the part of the school authority, who had been pre-informed of the plan to kidnap the students.\n\n\u201cThe distance between the school and the police station in that area is about one kilometre and the distance between the school and the divisional police headquarters in the state is between six and seven kilometres. I cannot understand why the school authority could not take the threat letter serious and inform the police for necessary action\n\n\u201cAs a Baptist school, owned by the Baptist Church, I think the church should investigate the school authority for their negligence.\u201d\n\nHe added that the action of the school matron and the school authority compounded the African challenge, where parents do not take their children seriously, even when they are saying something serious, just because they are children.\n\nHe advised parents and teachers to always listen to children, respect them and take them seriously whenever they lodge complaints.\n\nHe said: \u201cApart from being the CAN chairman of Kaduna State, I am a parent and my child attends the school and I am also a pastor in Baptist Church, which was the reason I sent my son who is in SS3 to that school.\n\n\u201cSo, if the expression of concern can rescue those in captivity and put an end to kidnapping, then kidnapping would have long ended in Kaduna State and in other states of the federation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the current demand for food items by the bandits, without talking about ransom, showed that the bandits were confident that nobody, including the government, could bring them to order.\n\n\u201cIf the bandits are on the run, they will not be asking for food items like rice, beans, garri, and oil to feed students in captivity. The best they can do is to ask for ransom, but instead of ransom, they are demanding for food items. They make these demands because they know that government and the parents can do nothing to them,\u201d Hayab said.\n\nNarrating the ordeal of his son during the kidnapping, Hayab said his 16-year- old son was among the few that escaped when the bandits struck.\n\nHe, however, said he would not disclose everything his son told him because the government had already started denying some of the things that happened when the pupils were kidnapped.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Muktar Betara, increased the budget size to N982,729,695,343, representing an increase of N86.9 billion to Buhari\u2019s proposal.\n\nBetara said N123,332,174,164 was for recurrent (non-debt) expenditure, while N859, 397,521,179 was for contribution to the development fund for capital expenditure for the year ending on December 31, 2021.\n\nSenate Approves $6.183bn External Loan Request\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has approved the federal government\u2019s request for $6.183 billion (N2.343 trillion) as external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nIt also directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; the Director-General of the Debt Management Office (DMO), Patience Oniha, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to submit to the National Assembly within 10 working days (excluding the day of close of trading), a letter containing the United States dollars amount so raised and received as a result of the approval together with the applicable exchange rate.\n\nThe external borrowing is expected to be sourced through the issuance of Eurobond in the international capital market.\n\nThe approval by the Senate was sequel to the consideration of a report by the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts.\n\nPresenting the report, Chairman of the Committee, Senator Clifford Ordia, said in considering the president\u2019s request, the committee noted the serious concerns of Nigerians about the level of sustainability and servicing of Nigeria\u2019s external borrowing.\n\n\u201cDue to the shortfall in our annual revenues in relation to our need for rapid infrastructural and human capital development, we had to pass deficit budget every year requiring us to borrow to finance the deficit in our budget,\u201d he stated.\n\nOrdia explained that the new borrowing was calculated at the exchange rate of $1/N379, and raised from multiple sources \u2013 multilateral and bilateral lenders through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nHe added that the proceeds of the $6.183 billion would be used to fund various specific capital projects in sectors ranging from power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, education and health, as well as the provision of counterpart funding for multilateral and bilateral projects, defence and water resources.\n\nHe stated that the final terms and conditions \u2013 the interest rate and tenors in the case of Eurobonds \u2013 can only be determined at the point of issuance of the bonds and would be subject to market conditions prevailing at the time of issuance.\n\nAccording to him, the primary listing of the bond will be on the London Stock Exchange while the secondary listing will be on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and Financial Markets Dealers Quotations (FMDQ) Securities Exchange.\n\nThe Senate, while adopting the resolutions of the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt approved the issuance of $3 billion but not more than $6,183,081,643.40 Eurobond in the international capital market for the implementation of the new external borrowing of N2,343,387,942,848, for the financing of part of the deficit, authorised in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nIt also approved that the amount authorised may be raised from multiple sources as may be available.\n\nIn his remarks, the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said that the approved external borrowing was not a fresh loan by the Buhari administration but a request captured in the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly last year.\n\nHe, however, tasked committees of the National Assembly to carry out strict oversight on the application of the loans to ensure that they are strictly applied to the implementation of the 2021 budget.\n\nLawan urged MDAs entrusted with the management of the funds to ensure prudent application to projects nationwide.\n\nBuhari, in a request letter dated May 18, 2021, and read at Senate plenary on June 2, 2021, had asked the Senate to approve N2.3 trillion external loan to fund the 2021 budget deficit.\n\nFG to fund N5.62tn deficit in 2022 budget with external loans.\n\nThe federal government has approved the 2022 \u2013 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and the Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF & FSP), authorising the funding of an N5.26 trillion budget deficit in 2022 through external borrowings.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, told journalists yesterday after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting that her ministry presented a memo to FEC with a 2022 projected revenue of N6.54 trillion and N2.62 trillion to accrue to the Federation Account and VAT, respectively.\n\nShe added that the revenue is projected to increase in 2023 to N9.15 trillion.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe also reported to the council the budget deficit and the financing items for the expenditure.\n\nThe budget deficit that is projected for 2022 is N5.62 trillion, up from N5.60 trillion in 2021. \u201cThis amount represents 3.05 per cent of the estimated GDP, which is slightly above the three per cent threshold that is specified in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The FRA empowers Mr. President to exceed the threshold if, in his opinion, the nation faces national security threats. And it is our opinion on fact agreed that we can exceed.\n\n\u201cThe deficit is going to be financed by new foreign borrowing and domestic borrowing, both domestic and foreign in the sum of N4.89 trillion on privatisation proceeds of N90.73 billion and drawdowns from existing project tied loans of N635 billion.\n\n\u201cI just want to state that the projected debt-to-revenue ratio in the report is 43 per cent. Which, of course, we know Nigerians all have concerns about the actual debt-to-revenue ratio in 2019 was 58 per cent. So, this is an improvement over 2019. In 2020, the ratio was up to 85 per cent. So 2022 is a significant improvement.\u201d\n\nShe explained that the MTF FSP describes the federal government\u2019s socio-economic and developmental objectives and priorities for the reporting period of 2022 to 2024 as well as the fiscal strategies to be put in place, and policies to achieve in the priorities.\n\nAhmed stated that the report to the council highlighted the key drivers of government\u2019s revenue and the spending plans.\n\nShe said they had also presented to the federal government the projected revenues for the 2022 to 2024.\n\nShe said she provided to the council, a macroeconomic background, which affirmed that the Nigerian economy has recovered from a negative growth of 1.8 per cent in 2020 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nShe added that inflation has moderated from a 19-month-high in two months, while it\u2019s now moderated in two months now, that is coming down to 17.93 per cent.\n\nShe said the key macro assumptions that were presented and approved by the council was that crude oil benchmark price would be $57 per barrel of crude oil for 2022, crude oil production of 1.8 8 million barrels per day, and exchange rate of N410 to one US dollar, an inflation rate of 10 per cent in 2022, and a nominal GDP of N149.369 trillion.\n\nAlso, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said FEC approved the Ecological Fund Projects for the third and fourth quarters of 2020 in many states.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says president has exhibited poor skills in management of Nigeria\u2019s diversity\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nA former military governor of Kaduna state Col. Dangiwa Umar (rtd), has berated the federal government over the security situation in the country, wondering why the goveement was according undue attention to the threats by separatist movements despite the more daunting security threats posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday in Kaduna, Umar, asked the federal government to go beyond the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and pay greater attention to the more serious security challenges threatening to cripple the country.\n\nAccording to him, the activities of bandits and insurgents have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 per cent of the villages in North West and North east, while hundreds of people were being murdered, maimed and kidnapped for ransom every week as million of others have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation.\n\nUmar said bandits had abducted over 1,000 school children in the north in the past eight months, adding that over 300 others are still in captivity, with the bandits demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe recent rearrest of the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was greeted with a loud sigh of relief and celebration in some sections of the country.\n\n\u201cIt also elicited congratulatory messages to the federal government which appears overwhelmed by the intractable security challenges and in dire need of any redeeming act.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an exaggeration of the security threat Nnamdi Kanu and indeed IPOB pose to our nation\u2019s security and unity\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is quite strange and disturbing that the federal government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cHundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom\u201d.\n\nHe lamented further that millions of people have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation. \u201cOver 1,000 school children were abducted in the past 8 months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\n\u201cRape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities,particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the Boko Haram insurgency in the North east has turned out to be empty propaganda\u201d, he said.\n\nUmar maintained that \u201cContrary to this claim, the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the North east.\u201d\n\nCol Umar said, \u201cFor the average northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him.\u201d\n\nHe argued that, \u201cThe arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is of no serious consequence, since it does nothing to ameliorate this harsh and brutal condition.\u201d\n\nHe said however that in recognizing the right of every citizen or groups to express the desire for self determination, the use of violence should not be supported or condone.\n\n\u201cIPOB and its leader may well be responsible for some of the violence, including the murder of security personnel, arson and destruction of public and private properties for which they should be held to account.\n\n\u201cWe must however be honest enough to identify the cause of the current growing restiveness in the South East\u201d, Umar said.\n\nHe called on the government to deploy nonviolent means in addressing the problem of people agitating for self determination.\n\nThe retired army officer said, \u201cIt is self evident that justice, fairness and equity are the best means of building a united and virile nation, particularly one as diverse and fragile as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is my long held believe that this country is more beneficial to all the federating units, if only because it provides a security umbrella to all its units.\n\n\u201cNone of them will fare better in a balkanized Nigeria due to their similar diversities.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of Nigeria as the giant of Africa is not on account of its huge oil wealth but its size, diversity as well as other potentials. These not withstanding, the nation can only remain united and prosperous when all its citizens and the component parts feel a true sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cWithout it, the nation\u2019s unity will be in serious jeopardy similar to what Nigeria is currently experiencing.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, the Buhari administration has so far exhibited poor skills in its management of our diversity.\n\n\u201cYet it has the benefit of great examples by past administrations and statesmen which should guide it.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that after the civil war from July 1967 to Jan 1970, the then Head of the Federal Military Government, General Yakubu Gowon, declared a no victor, no vanquished reconciliation and reintegration policy, noting that its implementation may not have been perfect, but it produced a guiding vision which served as a template for the reintegration of the nation.\n\nUmar\u2019s statement read: \u201cIn 1978, eight years after the civil war, the NPN (National Party of Nigeria), Presidential candidate, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, a former Commissioner of Finance in the Gowon Government, picked his running mate, Dr Alex Ekweme from the South east. \u201cThey won the 1979 Presidential election and enjoyed an enviable brotherly relationship as President and Vice President.\n\n\u201cThey won a second term in 1983. President Shagari\u2019s Government pardoned the former Biafra secessionist leader, Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, which permitted him to return from exile in 1982.\n\n\u201cHe went on to contest a senatorial seat under the NPN.\n\n\u201cThese are in sharp contrast to the declaration of President Buhari after his election in 2015 in which he promised not to treat, on equal terms, those who gave him only 5% of their votes with those who gave him over 97% of theirs.\n\n\u201cThis may account for his government\u2019s refusal to appoint an Igbo as head of any of the security services.\n\n\u201cA review of this ill-advised policy will go a long way to neutralise the growing influence of IPOB among Ndigbo, both at home and in diaspora\u201d, he said\n\nUmar stressed that \u201cfederal government must go beyond the arrest of Kanu and pay greater attention to the more serious security challenges threatening to cripple the country completely.\n\n\u201cThe apparent failure of our security forces to deal decisively, as the President so often commands them to do, with these security threats is obviously due to the acute shortage of manpower and equipment.\n\n\u201cThese deficiencies have resulted in the thin spread of our forces and lack of timely rotation in areas of conflict. Government must massively increase security manpower and equipment. As we have seen, mere change of Service chiefs would appear far from being the solution.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

She was also accused of presenting a forged NYSC discharged certificate.\n\nShe however instituted a suit against the Attorney General of the Federation on her eligibility for the National Youth Service Corps Scheme.\n\nDelivering judgement in Folakemi Adeosun v The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC/ABJ/CS/303/2021) Wednesday, Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, declared that the former finance minister was not eligible to perform national service because she was not a Nigerian citizen under the 1979 Constitution (which did not provide for dual citizenship) which was in force at the time of her graduation in 1989 from a London university at 22 and when she turned 30, which was the age of exemption from service.\n\nThe court held that available facts before it proved that the former minister was a United Kingdom citizen having been born there in 1967 and remained there till 2003 when she came back to Nigeria at 36.\n\nThe court also noted that Adeosun, who became a Nigerian citizen by virtue of the 1999 Constitution which came into force on May 29, 1999, was not required by the constitution to present her first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, before she could be appointed as a minister.\n\nIn a statement sent to THISDAY, the former minister said she was happy with official clarification by the court, adding that the judgment has vindicated her after a traumatic spell.\n\nShe also said she would at the appropriate time take all further steps necessary within the law to protect her reputation.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cMy lawyers have informed me of the judgment by the Federal High Court, Abuja, in the case of Folakemi Adeosun v The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC/ABJ/CS/303/2021) in which the court, presided over by Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ruled that the constitution does not require me to present my first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, to be appointed a Minister. More importantly, he also ruled that I was not eligible to perform NYSC by virtue of the constitution. This is the position I have always maintained and am happy for this official clarification.\n\n\u201cThe ruling vindicates me after a very traumatic spell.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari and his power brokers in the All Progressives Congress (APC) have again shaded former Lagos State Governor and APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, by approving a subtle indefinite tenure for the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Buni who had been in charge since when Adams Oshiomhole \u2013 Tinubu\u2019s loyalist \u2013 and his members were sacked in June 2020, ought to have come up with the calendar of the party\u2019s national convention, but Buhari\u2019s loyalists stated that it was not yet time.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the reluctance to announce national convention and choose national executives was to weaken the power and influence of Asiwaju in pushing for his candidates who would then begin more mobilisation for his yet-to-be-announced 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nThe development is already polarizing further the Buhari camp and the Tinubu camp in the APC, while other smaller camps have to take a stand between Buhari and Tinubu in the silent struggle.\n\n\u201cThe indefinite tenure exten\u00adsion granted to the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC is not going down well with us. Buhari has an agenda.

This is against the spirit and letters of the agreement for the committee members,\u201d a source in Lags APC, familiar with the development, stated.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that while the APC weeks ago released the formal timetable for congresses from ward level to the state level, it failed to an\u00adnounce date for the national convention, a situation which means that the committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State will continue in office indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses.

          "text": "Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province terrorists have been taxing residents of Marte, Abadam, Kukawa and Guzamala areas of Borno state for road use.\n\nThat is aside from the levies farmers and fishermen have to pay on their produce.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the failure of residents to comply with this directive attracts the death penalty.\n\nOne of the affected persons, who spoke with SaharaReporters, noted that residents have been forced to obey every directive issued by the insurgents, who are now in control of the area, especially with the integration of the deadlier ISWAP group.\n\nWhen asked if there was no military presence in the area, he said the operations of military personnel are not evident in the area as the whole area had been cordoned off by terrorists, who have taken charge like a government.\n\nHe said, \u201cWho dares disobey the insurgents? That person must be ready to die. You know, it is not only Boko Haram, we now have ISWAP. No one has even dared it because we know the consequence, they will simply pull the trigger. The insurgents have taken over, they have turned this place into their own kingdom. We obey their set rules. Traders and farmers pay N5,000 monthly, while the fishermen pay N2,000 per bag and box of fish.\"\n\nAnother resident said apart from that, \"along the road to Baga in the Kukawa Local Government, going to the fish market at Kukawa, the insurgents charge for road use between the range of N200 and N500, then when returning, after buying items, the trader will still pay. The driver will also pay to the insurgents.\"\n\n\u201cAnyone who does not have money to pay, the insurgents will seize their phone then probably after selling the fish or whatever produce, you can go back and pay to get back the phone. Also, they sometimes ask for bread and drugs for people that they know will go to town to sell the fish,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking the Director-General, Centre for Justice on Religion and Ethnicity in Nigeria, Kallamu Musa Ali Dikwa who hails from Dikwa, said insurgents have taken over the land.\n\n\u201cMy own area, the people have been under Boko Haram and ISWAP and many other places for long, since the administration of Goodluck Jonathan and now under Buhari, they have been under Boko Haram. No one can enter where they are. The issue of fishermen at Kukawa Local Government Area, the terrorist took over the place, the people there are into fish farming, but as at then, they stopped the people, it is the Boko Haram that was selling the fish to even military people at a time.\n\n\u201cThis was what they did for long, now the terrorists have reshuffled, they selected their own governor. We are in a very terrible situation. The ISWAP members are not only in these areas, they are everywhere in Borno State, observing so that they can attack effectively. The government is not serious. ISWAP has access to the government and even the media.\n\n\u201cThey are also advanced technologically while the people do not even have access to the telephone network. This thing they are doing is rampant in Northern Borno and the government is not saying or doing anything about it. The way we are seeing it, something is wrong. Though this is not only in Northern Borno but you see, Marte, Dikwa and the rest have been taken over completely by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cThese people have an agenda and by the time they start operations fully, people will suffer, especially as ISWAP is involved, a deadly sect under Al-Qaeda. How can terrorists take over everywhere, collect taxes and the Nigerian government will sit and be watching them? There must be something behind it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, SaharaReporters earlier reported that the Interim Council of the Islamic State West African Province-Boko Haram terrorists\u2019 group, headed by one Abu Mus\u2019ab Al-Barnawiy, has introduced mobile courts and policies overseeing insurgents activities and groups under the leadership of the Islamic State Of Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe Council had also established two Wilaya\u2019s (Caliphates) at Lake Chad and Sambisa forest to sustain its war against countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe terrorist group was said to have lifted the ban imposed on fishing and farming activities in the Lake Chad area, three years after chasing people out of for allegedly spying for Nigerian troops.\n\nIt nevertheless, imposed new taxes and levies in the areas controlled by ISWAP-Boko Haram, to regulate trades and agricultural activities.\n\nSeveral fishermen, farmers and merchants have returned to the Lake-Chad area to engage in socio-economic activities, under the arrangement of the new ISWAP-Boko Haram leadership.",

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

Six tons of hard muscle and bones will do a cruel number on any lawn, no matter how stubborn the grass is\u2014it just has to bow down to the ancestors.\n\nBut what happens when the elephants in question are not two, but three of the biggest Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) platforms in Africa!\n\nWhat\u2019s the big news?\n\nWell, the grass just got greener on the Netflix side of town.\n\nNextflix just announced a mobile-only subscription starting at $3.99\u2014 that\u2019s more than half the price of its basic subscription plan.\n\nSomebody play Dorime.\n\nThe new plan caters for the majority of its African audience who stream Netflix from their mobile. And is currently available to users in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and other SubSaharan countries.\n\nThat\u2019s not all.\n\nNetflix also launched a Play Partial Download feature that allows users to play Netflix videos which haven\u2019t downloaded completely.\n\nThis means that if your connection cuts off while you\u2019re downloading an episode of Blood and Water, you can still watch the fraction that actually entered your device, and resume your download when you get a stronger connection.\n\nAre you excited? Because we are!\n\nBut this news isn\u2019t exactly unexpected, given the fact that Netflix\u2019s been in a streaming battle with two other African SVOD elephants, iRokoTV and Showmax.\n\nIn fact, with each party trying to outdo the other with more customer-friendly updates, it was actually pretty predictable, and we\u2019ll show you why.\n\nNetflix\u2019s streaming tussle in Africa\n\nWhen Netflix arrived in Africa in 2016, everyone anticipated a struggle with reigning SVOD champion, iRokoTV, even though Netflix offered mostly foreign movies and while iRokoTV focused on Nollywood.\n\nAs expected Netflix proved its mettle by edging into the African movies market too with blockbuster movies like October 1, Lion Heart, The boy who harnessed the wind, Azali, amongst others.\n\nWith Netflix pushing on one end, and a decline in the spending income of its primary market, Nigerians, iRokoTV faced its abroad audience\u2014who can blame them, really?\n\nAnd just when Netflix thought it was its turn to hog the spotlight, boom!\n\nAnother bull elephant in the ring\n\nIts name? Showmax. A MultiChoice platform, which gained increasing popularity during Season 5 of the Big Brother Naija show.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t know Showmax had another ace in its pocket besides BBN.\n\nIn April, Showmax announced that it would offer a new and affordable mobile plan price\u201420% less than the original plan price\u2014to accommodate its users who might be having it rough after the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe know that consumers are under pressure at the moment and we believe this change will be appreciated by our mobile customers as will the decision not to increase any of our other prices\u201d, said Yolisa Phahle, MultiChoice Group CEO for Connected Video.\n\nNetflix in the mud.\n\nBut not for long\u2026\n\nObviously, with the release of this cheaper plan, Netflix may come out on top in this SVOD race to corner the African market.\n\nHowever, all eyes are on iRokoTV now. Maybe they\u2019d get an acute case of FOMO and surprise us.

          "text": "Car manufacturers in Egypt have had to cut down on production due to a recent lack of electronic control units (ECUs), which are major components in vehicle electrical systems. In South Africa, more than 20,000 people that signed up for Supersonic\u2019s Unlimited Air Fibre service are still waiting to be connected since February, as the company continues to face difficulties getting crucial router components.\n\nThe aforementioned companies operate in two distinct industries (automobile and ICT) and \u2013 apart from the consumers they sell to \u2013 do not really have much in common. But like many others in several industries across the world, they have seen their businesses disrupted by the same problem.\n\nTechnology companies globally have recently been grappling with the shortage of one of the smallest components used in producing millions of tech products yearly \u2013 semiconductor chips.\n\nMonths into the shortage, effects from the ongoing global chip scarcity have spread far and wide, across industries and the globe. Automotive and consumer hardware companies are being hit the worst and those in Africa have not been spared.\n\nDistributors of Acer products in South Africa \u2013 Mustek, Rectron, and Homemation \u2013 told ITWeb that the severe shortage has caused a ripple effect across all industry verticals, leading to a shortage of laptops, tablets, printing and scanning equipment, and peripherals.\n\nThe automobile industry is one of the hardest hit by the semiconductor shortage with carmakers across the world forced to slash production.\n\nPrice jumps as over 100 industries suffer\n\nAn analysis by U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs, estimates that the semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way. This is due to the fact that chips are more widely used today. They used to be present in only personal computers and mobile phones a little over a decade ago. Now, in the wake of rapid digital advancements, semiconductors are in everything from vehicles to washing machines.\n\nManufacturers have struggled to keep up with the huge demand in recent months, a problem blamed partly on supply chain disruptions caused by national Covid-19 lockdowns, uncertainties stemming from the U.S.-China trade war, as well as a drought in Taiwan, home to the largest semiconductor maker in the world.\n\nIn fact, Taiwan is one of the four countries in Asia behind nearly three-quarters of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Of these countries, only two produce the most cutting-edge chips.\n\nThe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone provides 92% of cutting-edge chips globally \u2013 with Samsung accounting for the rest \u2013 and 60% of chips used by automobile companies. This leaves companies with few options to get chips when the producers run out of capacity and also raises concerns about the concentration of chip manufacturing in relatively few countries.\n\nThe global semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nU.S. tech giant Apple has been significantly affected as it is one of TSMC\u2019s biggest clients. In South Africa, many stores run by the company\u2019s authorised reseller, iStore, have reportedly experienced shortages in iPhone stock. Meanwhile, TechCabal was unable to reach the Nigerian unit of iStore for comments as of the time this article was published.\n\nGoing by the law of demand and supply in economics, there is bound to be an increase in the price of a product when there\u2019s a scarcity, as long as all things remain equal. So the global chip shortage has naturally led to price increases and there\u2019s not so much local players can do about it.\n\n\u201cThese are not components domestic car makers can produce,\u201d head of the Egyptian Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Khaled Saad, reportedly told local press. \u201cThe problem is already putting pressure on car prices domestically and it is expected to raise prices further.\u201d\n\nReports show many local stores in South Africa are now selling well above the retail prices suggested by manufacturers.\n\nAccording to David Kan, CEO of Mustek, the ongoing shortage is the worst in more than three decades. \u201cIn my 34 years of working within the IT industry, I have never experienced or seen such shortages. Pricing has gone through the roof!\u201d\n\nAny end in sight?\n\nThe multifaceted global chip shortage problem is showing no signs of abating.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there were hopes that the supply chain issues would have been sorted by the summer. However, it is unlikely that will be the case, even though the summer does not end until September.\n\nIndustry analysts also can\u2019t seem to agree on when the shortage will end, with predictions ranging from the second half of 2021 to the beginning of 2022. Some experts say the effects of the crisis could last well into 2023. However, the general consensus seems to be that things will get even worse before it gets better as there is no immediate solution.\n\nSome global chipmakers \u2013 such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel \u2013 are already investing to expand their capacity and ramp up production. The U.S. is also working towards investing billions in its semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Africa, Kenya\u2019s Dedan Kimathi University of Technology partnered with American firm 4Wave Inc on the launch of the country\u2019s first semiconductor factory earlier this year.\n\nA future partnership between local car agents and brand owners to set up local facilities for manufacturing high-tech components like semiconductors is also being mooted among automobile stakeholders in Egypt.\n\nBut these moves can do little to ease off the crisis immediately as it will take months, if not several years, for the investments to mature.\n\nFor now, tech products are bound to keep fighting for limited chips, manufacturers grappling with delayed production, and consumers suffering from shortages and price increases.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "What telcos and banks look for in fintech partnerships",
          "text": "Fintech is growing in Africa thanks to strategic partnerships between startups, banks and diverse categories of global companies. According to McKinsey & Company, at least five models of partnerships are currently favoured.\n\nOne model is a vendor relationship: a bank that needs to quickly go to market with an innovation opts to ride on a fintech\u2019s technology, avoiding the hassle of building from scratch.\n\nIn a distribution model, a digital-only bank (say Kuda) partners with traditional banks to offer in-branch deposits, ATM withdrawals and card issuance. Chaka, the recently licensed stock trading app, has been able to provide investment options to users by working with brokerage partners.\n\nOther partnership models from McKinsey\u2019s research include strategic Investments (like Visa\u2019s 20% stake in Interswitch); joint ventures (where two entities create a common product together); and outright acquisitions \u2013 the popular example over the past year being Paystack\u2019s acquisition by Stripe.\n\nWhatever the partnership type, the aim is to win. For a startup, a long term win might be a successful exit or Initial Public Offering (IPO). Otherwise, the immediate goal is to accelerate growth at a rate they wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve if they worked alone.\n\nBut partnerships don\u2019t automatically work just because two parties have good intentions or similar ambitions.\n\nNot a piece of cake\n\n\u201cSuccess should not be taken for granted and both parties need to be well prepared,\u201d says Mayowa Kuyoro, partner at McKinsey and head of its West Africa financial services practice.\n\nAlignment on resources, culture and regulatory compliance, among other factors, is key.\n\nIt\u2019s a consideration that is always on Abubakar Suleiman\u2019s mind. As CEO of Sterling Bank, Suleiman receives partnership offers regularly and believes himself open to having many conversations.\n\nBut he has identified a problem: \u201cMore often than not, we are not clear about the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cWe are trying to jump into partnerships because we think there is profit to be shared.\u201d\n\nPartnership conversations have worked better for Suleiman when the initial focus was on problems and the capacity to solve them. And so he wishes to encourage an approach that frames partnerships in terms of capabilities, not institutions.\n\nFor example, a startup that needs a partner for regulatory issues should go for the most capable and experienced firm on the subject. It should not matter whether this firm is a big bank or whatever else.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the table?\n\nThat said, the size of rewards at stake for both parties matters.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make sure the economics work out for everybody,\u201d says Tayo Oviosu, co-founder and CEO of Paga.\n\nHe cites the example of Paga\u2019s partnership with Interswitch in the 2010s which, though initially successful in terms of returns to both parties, tapered off for a while. It raised a need for a review after which Paga decided it was in its best interest to plug directly into every other billing services provider in Nigeria.\n\nRia, the money transfer service provider, operates in 43 African countries. According to Robert Kotei, operations director for Africa, startups and companies present beyond one country can be more appealing to multinational companies looking for partnerships.\n\nHowever, sometimes a startup may need to patiently prove itself before landing big partnerships.\n\nWhile getting Bankly off the ground in 2019, Tomilola Majekodunmi faced the dilemma of deciding what partners she needed for the startup\u2019s ambition to digitalise contributory savings networks known as ajo. To achieve this, Bankly planned to work with telcos.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, partly because the potential partners were already looking to directly offer services similar to what Bankly proposed. They did not see a unique advantage to entice them towards a partnership.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a fair or just partnership either because we were too young or too small for these big players,\u201d Majekodunmi said. So Bankly spent two years building an agent network which now numbers 15,000 agents across Nigeria.\n\nMinimum viable partnerships\n\nElsa Muzzolini, a general manager for MTN\u2019s mobile financial services, acknowledges the difficulty in partnering with relatively small startups. Three factors, she said, are often at play.\n\nParties may have different expectations for how long deals take to complete. They may diverge on the initially agreed scope, and finding the precise contact person who can activate decisions can be hard.\n\nWhere these factors come together, partnerships can work. But Muzzolini would like startups to seek avenues for collaboration that bypass the formal phases that a typical partnership entails.\n\n\u201cCan we do a lighter form of partnership? Get my API, run with it. Maybe at a later stage as your numbers grow, we can discuss co-branding and other things.\u201d\n\nFollow all TechCabal Live conversations on our YouTube channel.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nLagos State\u2019s new tech for capturing traffic offenders\n\nTix Africa\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\nLydia\u2019s $8.3m pre-Series B\n\nTracking traffic offenders in Lagos with tech\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? The Lagos State Government plans to deploy Traffic Management Solution (TMS) devices to capture traffic offenders, expose corrupt government officials, and reduce gridlocks.\n\nWhat\u2019s TMS? According to Premium Times, Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde says it\u2019s a handheld device that can capture video and picture evidence of traffic violations in real-time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not all: Traffic offenders can also use the device to pay fines. This means payments will be made directly to the government, giving no chance for extortion or corruption.\n\nPer Oladeinde, \u201cThe innovation will aid the eradication of fine-payment controversy between traffic law enforcement officers and violators, as only electronic payments guarantee the clearance of a violation from the violators\u2019 list.\u201d\n\nEnd to traffic jams in Lagos? Per TechCabal, Oladeinde also says bad drivers cause 50% of traffic problems, and the TMS device will curb these behaviours.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: In January 2021, PayVis was introduced in Lagos State to detect plate numbers of traffic offenders. Per Business Day, it is a camera placed next to traffic lights. While both devices are alike, TMS does more than PayVis.\n\nThis is not the first time we\u2019ll be seeing the Nigerian government use tech solutions. In April 2021, we reported Eye-Mark, a web-based platform where citizens can report poorly executed projects. Perhaps, we\u2019ll see the government deploy more tech solutions for problems in the future.\n\nNow that fines will be paid digitally, can this device really stop corrupt officials from extorting motorists? Tell us what you think in the comments section.\n\nTix Africa raises six-figure pre-seed\n\nNigerian self-service ticketing platform, Tix Africa, has closed an undisclosed six-figure pre-seed.\n\nWhat\u2019s Tix Africa? Say you have a ticketed event \u2014 concerts, conferences, seminars, or even owambes if you\u2019re daring enough \u2014 Tix Africa claims to help you create a customisable web page to collect payments easily through Paystack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Folayemi Agusto and Nosa Oyegun, the startup was created to tackle the challenges of hosting a ticketed event in Lagos.\n\nWhat\u2019s the funding for? It will go into expanding Tix Africa\u2019s development team, revamping its mobile app and expansion into Ghana, Uganda, Kenya and Egypt.\n\nThe funding was led by HoaQ \u2014 a community of creators and operators supporting early startup founders \u2014 supported by Ire Aderinokun, Buycoins Co-founder, and several unnamed angel investors.\n\nWhat\u2019s the bigger picture? Events could become a major revenue source in Africa. According to Brookings Institution\u2019s 2018 Africa tourism potential report, by 2030, the continent\u2019s spending on tourism, hospitality, and recreation is expected to reach $261.77 billion.\n\nFor more details on this pre-seed funding, check here\n\nLidya raises $8.3 million pre-Series B\n\nLidya co-founders: Tunde Kehinde and Ercin Eksin\n\nNigerian fintech, Lidya, has announced an $8.3 pre-Series B round to grow its lending operations to small and medium enterprises across its markets.\n\nA little backstory: Lidya was founded in 2016 by Tunde Kehinde, former Jumia Co-founder and Managing Director, and Ercin Eksin, former Jumia COO.\n\nBoth founders left Jumia in 2013/2014 to start Africa Courier Express (ACE), a logistics and eCommerce platform; the duo launched Lidya after that.\n\nTo know more about ACE, check out this interview we had with Kehinde and Eksin back in 2015.\n\nIn 2017, Lidya announced a seed funding of $1.5 million and $6.9 million Series A in 2018. Now, the startup has raised $16.45 million in total.\n\nAfter its Series A, Lidya planned to expand into other African countries, but to date, it is only present in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, in 2019, the lending platform expanded to two European countries \u2014 Poland and the Czech Republic \u2014 where it has disbursed $3 million in loans.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Lydia\u2019s $8.3 million funding here\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nDaystar Power receives $20 million in funding to boost operations in West Africa.

          "text": "Today, Nigeria-based hybrid renewable energy provider, Daystar Power, has received a $20 million investment from the International Finance Corporation(IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank Group.\n\nThis follows an announcement made by IFC in April 2021 that they were considering giving a $20 million loan to Daystar Power.\n\nThe funding, which comes in two ways, will be used to carry out more renewable energy projects in Nigeria, where the company presently operates 150 solar power systems.\n\nIt will also advance its mission to expand its current power capacity from 29 megawatts (MW) to 140MW by 2024.\n\nThe first half of the loan would be disbursed in local currency (\u20a64.2 billion) to Daybreak Power Solutions, the Nigerian subsidiary of the company.\n\nThe second half would be an ancillary loan funded by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa, which was established to boost private sector investment in the industry on the continent.\n\nCurrently, Daystar Power provides solar power solutions to businesses in the commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors and claims to offer a 30 per cent reduction in energy cost.\n\nClients are serviced via a hybrid model after paying a certain amount. This combines solar power supply and battery storage, and clients can integrate this model into their existing power channels like an electrical grid or diesel/fuel generators.\n\nFounded in 2017 to reduce the cost of electricity and tackle the issue of epileptic power supply faced by businesses in Africa, Daystar Power has since expanded its operations. Currently, it has branches in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Togo.\n\nDaystar Power\u2019s CEO and Co-founder, Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, believes that the funds will multiply their installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power.\n\nThis fund complements their former investments of $42 million. With a $38 million Series B raise in January and a $4 million funding for their Ghana expansion, this brings it to $62 million in 2021.\n\nA sustainable power supply is essential to nation-building. Startups and small businesses in Nigeria and Africa at large have long suffered the problem of insufficient electricity, and funding for renewable energy companies will go a long way in helping to diminish the dastardly economic effects of this problem.",

          "text": "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has engaged some commercial banks as agents to freeze and recover N1.8 trillion from accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited And MultiChoice Africa.\n\nThis is contained in a statement issued by Abdullahi Ahmad, Director, Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nMultichoice is the owner of the satellite television, DSTV, a popular subscription-based platform in Nigeria.\n\nThe FIRS explained that the decision to appoint the banks as agents and to freeze the accounts was as a result of the groups\u2019 continued refusal to grant FIRS access to their servers for audit.\n\nThe service said it discovered that the companies persistently breached all agreements and undertakings with the Service.\n\nThe Executive Chairman FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying, \u201cthe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records.\n\n\u201cParticularly, MCN has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company,\u201d Mr Nami stated.\n\nThe service added that the groups\u2019 performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nThe FIRS further noted that the level of non-compliance by Multi-Choice Africa (MCA), the parent Company MCN was very alarming adding that the parent company, which provided services to MCN had never paid Value Added Tax (VAT) since its inception.\n\n\u201cThe issue with Tax collection in Nigeria, especially from foreign-based Companies conducting businesses in Nigeria and making massive profits is frustrating and infuriating to the FIRS.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, Companies come into Nigeria just to infringe on our tax laws by indulging in tax evasion. There is no doubt that broadcasting, telecommunications and the cable-satellite industries have changed the face of communication in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to tax compliance, some companies are found wanting. They do with impunity in Nigeria what they dare not try in their countries of origin,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chairman stated that Nigeria contributed 34 per cent of total revenue for the Multi-Choice group, and the next to Nigeria is Kenya with 11 per cent and Zambia in third place with 10 per cent.\n\nAccording to him, the rest African countries where they have presence account for 45 per cent of the group\u2019s total revenue.\n\n\u201cInformation currently at the disposal of FIRS has revealed a tax liability for relevant years of assessment for \u20a61.8 trillion and 342.5 million dollars.\n\n\u201cFIRS is empowered in Section 49 of the Companies Income Tax Act Cap C21 LFN 2004 as amended, Section 41 of the Value Added Tax Act Cap V1 LFN 2004 as amended and Section 31 of the FIRS (Establishment) Act No. 13 of 2007.\n\n\u201cWith these relevant sections all bankers to MCA and MCN in Nigeria are therefore appointed as Collecting Agents for the full recovery of the aforesaid tax debt.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the affected banks are required to sweep balances in each of the above-mentioned entities\u2019 accounts and pay the same in full or part settlement of the companies\u2019 respective tax debts until full recovery.\n\n\u201cThis should be done before the execution of any transaction involving the companies or any of their subsidiaries. It is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\n\n\u201dIt is important that Nigeria puts a stop to all tax frauds that had been going on for too long and all companies must be held accountable and made to pay their fair share of relevant taxes including back duty taxes owed especially VAT,\u201d he said.

Sunday Igboho is a Yoruba man, he lives in Ibadan, so he is a son of Kabiesi Olubadan, and we are duty-bound to protect him.\n\n\u201cSo if he is operating within the limit of the law, we are supposed to protect him, so Kabiesi is using this opportunity to say that we did not collect any money from anybody irrespective of anybody at all.\n\n\u201cAt 92 going to 93, what does he need much money for? Is it to rear up children, to send children to school, to build houses, to buy vehicles? So tell me what he has not been able to do in life.\n\n\u201cSo, the story is not true, and I\u2019m also using this medium to warn those on the social media to be very mindful of what they disseminate because those stories have a great effect on innocent people.\n\nSunday Igboho whose Soka residence in Ibadan was raided on Thursday managed to escape the raid by operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS).\n\nThe secessionist agitator is currently in hiding after the raid and was declared wanted by the DSS.",

          "text": "The Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba Land, Chief Gani Adams, has stated that majority of the tactics used by the self-proclaimed Yoruba Nation\u2019s actualization fighter, Sunday Igboho, are incorrect.\n\nIn a video made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, Gani Adams said this while speaking to a crowd.\n\nSunday Igboho, according to the Yoruba High Chief, had used more propaganda in the campaign for self-determination.\n\nAdams criticized Igboho\u2019s threat to reopen the borders forcibly, saying that assertions that 1,000 police officers would not return if they stormed his home were unfounded.\n\nThe Aare Onakakanfo expressed his concern with the fact that things that should be kept private were being shared on social media.\n\nHe did, however, call on Obas, governors, and Yoruba leaders to unite around Sunday Igboho and spare him from being slain.\n\nHis words: \u201cI beg the Ooni of Ife, the Alake of Egba and all other Yoruba leaders. If a son offends his father, the father will forgive him. Let us unite to use another method for our liberation. We are not saying we should adopt Sunday Igboho\u2019s method.\n\n\u201cMost of Sunday Igboho\u2019s method are wrong. I told him that his methods are wrong. But God has used him on the agitation for Yoruba Nation. He has played his own role and he will still play more roles. We should not let him be killed or persecuted.\n\n\u201cAs the Aare Onakakanfo, I am begging you. Assuming he and his followers had not insulted me before, you will say that is why I\u2019m saying this. But a leader without the spirit of forgiveness is an enemy of God. I beg the governors too.\n\n\u201cSunday Igboho should caution his talkative followers so that they won\u2019t put him into trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recalled how he was put into trouble by OPC members years back, saying Sunday Igboho is now at that stage he left behind as a youth many years ago.\n\n\u201cYou said you wanted to go and open border. That will be the beginning of war. You don\u2019t need to say that. It will be counterproductive. You don\u2019t have war materials, you were molesting the Army, counterproductive. You said if 1,000 policemen visited your house, hardly will 100 return. You don\u2019t need all that. Propaganda should not be too much in self-determination.\n\n\u201cI beg all Yorubas, let\u2019s rally round him and support him.\n\n\u201cAt this position I am now, I can\u2019t be jumping up and down like him. But any statement I issue is more powerful than that in 10 years. I sit on a strategic institution in the entire Yoruba and I must be conscious of my behaviours so that I will not disappoint the institution. The institution has been in existence in the past 500 years.\n\n\u201cOur youths, let\u2019s be coordinated, let\u2019s be strategic,\u201d Gani Adams said, saying he stands with Yoruba Nation.\n\nAdams promised to stand with Sunday Igboho, the same way some Yoruba leaders stood up for him during his ordeal in 2001.",

          "title": "Tears, Prayers Mark End to Search for Miami Condo Survivors",
          "text": "A sombre moment of silence marked the end of the two-week search for survivors of a Florida condominium collapse, as rescue workers stood at solemn attention and clergy members hugged a line of local officials while many of them sobbed.\n\nThe painstaking search for survivors shifted to a recovery effort at midnight Wednesday after authorities said they had come to the agonizing conclusion that there was \u201cno chance of life\u201d in the rubble of the Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside.\n\n\u201cWe have all asked God for a miracle, so the decision to transition from rescue to recovery is an extremely difficult one,\u201d Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at a news conference.\n\nThe death toll stood at 54 late Wednesday. Officials said 86 people were unaccounted for, although detectives were still working to verify that each of those listed as missing was actually in the building when it collapsed.\n\nRescuers had spent two weeks digging through the rubble, searching in vain for any sign of life, Levine Cava said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve used every possible strategy, and every possible technology available to them to find people in the rubble,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve removed over 7 million pounds of concrete and debris from the mound. They\u2019ve used sonar, cameras, dogs, heavy machinery. They\u2019ve searched for void spaces and they\u2019ve searched for victims. They ran into a building they were told could collapse, and they braved fire, smoke, torrential rain, and strong winds in the hopes of finding people alive.\u201d\n\nHours before the formal transition from rescue to recovery mission, those emergency workers joined local officials, rabbis and chaplains in a moment of silence.\n\nAn accordion player unseen on a nearby tennis court played Aaron Copland\u2019s \u201cFanfare for the Common Man,\u201d which was followed by a piccolo playing \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d Firefighters from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the federal government and elsewhere were also present.\n\nOn a tall nearby fence, families and well-wishers had posted photos of the victims, supportive messages and flowers. Firefighters hung a banner atop the fence that read \u201cMiami-Dade Fire Rescue Mourns With You.\u201d\n\nOfficials vowed to continue the recovery efforts until they find the remains of every one of the missing.\n\nMiami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah told families during a private briefing that crews would stop using rescue dogs and listening devices.\n\n\u201cOur sole responsibility at this point is to bring closure,\u201d he said, as relatives cried in the background.\n\nLater, during a news conference, Jadallah said crews remained committed to doing whatever it takes to finish the job.\n\n\u201cThe resources are still there. The men and women are still there. The support is still there,\u201d said Jadallah, who began crying silently after he spoke.\n\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Alan Cominsky said he expects the recovery effort will take several more weeks.\n\nDennis Dirkmaat, an anthropology professor who chairs the Department of Applied and Forensic Sciences at Mercyhurst University, said he expects crews will use heavy equipment in a \u201ctop down approach\u201d to methodically lift material off the debris pile, place it in containers and evaluate it for evidence of human remains. He said the process would likely be repeated as the crews move to subsequent floors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a process, slow, tedious process of removing all of this debris. And so it\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d he said.\n\nHope of finding survivors was briefly rekindled after workers demolished the remainder of the building, allowing rescuers access to new areas of debris.\n\nSome of t ose voids did exist, mostly in the basement and the parking garage, but no survivors emerged. Instead, teams recovered more than a dozen additional victims. Because the building fell in the early morning hours, many were found dead in their beds.\n\nNo one has been pulled out alive since the first hours after the 12-story building fell on June 24.\n\nTwice during the search operation, rescuers had to suspend the mission because of the instability of the remaining part of the condominium building and the preparation for demolition.\n\nAfter initially hoping for miraculous rescues, families had slowly braced themselves for the news that their relatives did not survive.\n\n\u201cFor some, what they\u2019re telling us, it\u2019s almost a sense of relief when they already know (that someone has died) and they can just start to put an end to that chapter and start to move on,\u201d said Miami-Dade firefighter and paramedic Maggie Castro, who has updated families daily.\n\nAuthorities are launching a grand jury investigation into the collapse and at least six lawsuits have been filed by Champlain Towers families.",

          "text": "Four people suspected of assassinating Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse have been killed in a shootout with the security forces, police say.\n\nTwo others have been detained, while officers are still in combat with some remaining suspects in the nation\u2019s capital Port-au-Prince.\n\n\u201cThey will be killed or captured,\u201d police chief Leon Charles said.\n\nMr Mo\u00efse, 53, was fatally shot and his wife was injured when attackers stormed their home early on Wednesday.\n\nThe unidentified gunmen entered the private residence in Port-au-Prince at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT). Mr Mo\u00efse was killed, but First Lady Martine Mo\u00efse survived and has been flown to Florida where she is receiving treatment.\n\nShe is reported to be in a stable but critical condition.\n\n\u201cFour mercenaries were killed [and] two were intercepted under our control,\u201d Mr Charles said in a televised statement late on Wednesday. \u201cThree policemen who had been taken hostage have been recovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe blocked [the suspects] en route as they left the scene of the crime,\u201d he added. \u201cSince then, we have been battling with them.\u201d\n\nPolice agents work near the house of the assassinated Haitian president, Jovenel Moise in Port-au-Prince\n\nSpeaking after the killing, interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph called for calm and declared a nationwide state of emergency.\n\nThe state of emergency, or \u201cstate of siege\u201d, allows for the banning of gatherings and use of the military for police roles, along with other extensions of executive powers.\n\nUS President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Haiti for the \u201chorrific assassination\u201d. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, called it \u201can abhorrent act\u201d and also appealed for calm.\n\nMr Mo\u00efse became president of Haiti in 2017, but in recent times faced widespread protests demanding his resignation.\n\nCoups, political instability, widespread gang violence and natural disasters have plagued the country for decades and rendered it the poorest nation in the Americas.\n\nMr Joseph said the attackers were \u201cforeigners who spoke English and Spanish\u201d. Haiti\u2019s official languages are Creole and French.\n\nSome reports spoke of men dressed in black who carried high-powered weapons who may have pretended to be part of a US drug enforcement operation, although no official details have been given.\n\nHaiti\u2019s ambassador to the US, Bocchit Edmond, said there was \u201cno way\u201d US drugs agents carried out the attack. He believed it was the work of \u201cprofessional mercenaries\u201d.\n\nMr Edmond later told Reuters news agency that the attackers were masquerading as US drug agents when they entered the president\u2019s residence.\n\nAddressing the nation, Mr Joseph vowed the killers would be brought to justice and said the security situation was \u201cunder control\u201d.\n\nThere has been widespread international condemnation of the assassination. The UN Security Council, which is due to hold a closed-door meeting on the killing on Thursday, issued a statement in which it made \u201can emphatic call on all political stakeholders in Haiti to refrain from any acts of violence or incitement\u201d.\n\nMr Joseph said that \u201call measures have been taken to ensure continuity\u201d and that \u201cdemocracy and the republic will win\u201d.\n\nBut questions remain about how much control he can assert.\n\nHaiti\u2019s constitution says ministers, under the leadership of the prime minister, take control in the event of presidential vacancy until elections can be called.\n\nBut that also remains unclear, as a new prime minister, Ariel Henry, was named by Mr Mo\u00efse just this week but has yet to be sworn in.\n\nThe US said it believed elections should go ahead this year, to bring about a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nJovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s time in office was rocky, as he faced accusations of corruption and there were widespread demonstrations in the capital and other cities earlier this year.\n\nParliamentary elections should have been held in October 2019 but disputes have delayed them, meaning Mr Mo\u00efse had been ruling by decree.\n\nIn February this year, on the day the opposition wanted him to leave office, Mr Mo\u00efse said an attempt to kill him and overthrow the government had been foiled.\n\nHaiti has also faced a wave of gang violence and kidnappings, particularly in the capital, with a number of its districts becoming no-go areas.\n\nThe worsening living standards in the nation of 11 million people have pushed nearly 60% below the poverty line.\n\nAn earthquake in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to the infrastructure and the economy.\n\nA UN peacekeeping force was put in place in 2004 to help stabilise the country, and only withdrew in 2017, but the turmoil has shown no sign of ending.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Oil Majors Back Petroleum Bill, Seek Speedy Assent",
          "text": "International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria on Wednesday rallied behind the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) passed by the National Assembly last week, describing it as a watershed in the annals of the oil and gas industry in the country.\n\nThe oil majors, including Total, Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron said at the 20th Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Conference and Exhibition in Abuja, that while there had been attempts in the past to push the bill, the latest round of consultations were the most intense.\n\nManaging Director, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and Country Chair of Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Osagie Okunbor, who participated in a panel discussion during the programme, stated that the industry was waiting for the bill to be harmonised and speedily assented by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the uncertainty that had enveloped the industry would be minimised, urging that the implementation of the law should be taken seriously to grow the industry and ensure more returns to stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor those of us on this side of the table, you could almost not have a decent discussion with your corporate organisation on any investment decision without that uncertainty element coming in. That is to say, under which law are we making these investment decisions?\n\n\u201cJust having this law finally bodes well for the industry and we all need to congratulate those who have played their own part. I have been with this PIB for the greater part of my career. Several times, when you mention it outside, they just laugh and say, \u2018we have been through this before.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe point to be made is that more than any time in the past, the industry has been consulted. All of us on this side of the table have had cause to go to the National Assembly to make our voices heard.\u201d\n\nHe stated that although the document is not perfect, all stakeholders have been carried along during putting the well-articulated bill together, while the industry is now waiting for the end product.\n\nManaging Director of Total Energies, Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster, said Nigeria deserved credit for finally passing the legislation, adding that though it took about a decade to pass the bill, the legislation would free the industry from some of the impediments that had inhibited its growth.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe look forward to the presentation of the final law. It has taken 20 years to get to this stage. Nigeria deserves some credit. The collaborative process has been good. The public hearings and engagements have been useful.\u201d\n\nHe stated that with 37 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and an optimistic production of two million barrels per day, it would take roughly 50 years to exhaust the resource, and a lot of investment would be needed before then.\n\nAccording to him, the bill will be critical to stimulate investment and encouraging increased production but added that other issues like security should be tackled head-on.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge challenge of security in terms of cost. Infrastructure, especially gas, needs to be encouraged. We need to work together to drive down the cost of doing business. Put side by side other countries, I think it\u2019s on the high side. We look forward to seeing the final harmonised bill next week,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Chairman and Managing Director of Chevron Nigeria, Mr. Richard Kennedy, joined his colleagues in congratulating the National Assembly \u201cfor reaching this milestone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I want to reiterate the high degree of stakeholder involvement and listening to everyone that will be impacted.\n\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time providing insights and input and we look forward to seeing that final version so that we can really dive into it in our transition from putting the bill together to operationalising it. We have a lot of work to do but it is going to be exciting,\u201d he said.\n\nManaging Director of ExxonMobil, Mr. Richard Laing, also said the uncertainty and multiple taxes surrounding the industry would now be addressed with the passage of the PIB.\n\n\u201cThis will bring certainty and after that will come the competitiveness in the industry and in my role, I have to go to the company to articulate to get funds in-country. And also, the bill will take care of the plethora of taxes we are faced with,\u201d he said.\n\nSenate Committee Chairman, Upstream, Senator Bassey Akpan, said the bill would be sent to the president for his assent next week, adding that there\u2019s no controversy over the funds allocated to the host communities.\n\n\u201cBetween now and Tuesday, the joint committee of the National Assembly of which I am one, will be laying the report at the plenary and should be heading towards the presidential villa before the end of next week.\n\n\u201cWe have for once constructively taken a note of the peculiarities of the different operators in the country, whether the IOCs, or other stakeholders in the course of our consultations and I think that we have captured the scenarios and we have proven that we will move the industry and the country forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the bill, when assented, will ensure transparency in the running of the industry and have a positive impact on the host communities.\n\nHe added that the state governments have been carefully excluded from the governance of the host community structure, which is now strictly between the settlor and the hosts.\n\nOn the controversy over the three per cent allocation to the communities, he said: \u201cThere are speculations as to whether it\u2019s three per cent or five per cent. What was laid before the National Assembly is five per cent of actual operators\u2019 expenses in the preceding year.\n\n\u201cWhat the Senate proposed was 2.5 per cent of the OPEX in the previous year and after all the consultations, we at the National Assembly believe that for there to be peaceful coexistence and based on reality, a chunk of their cost of production is attributable to insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe in the Senate believe that by the increase of the 2.5 per cent to five per cent and placing some elements of responsibility on the protection of the assets on the host communities, we will stop the issues of blockades.\u201d\n\nHe added that once the huge sums spent on security by oil companies are put into the fund, in the long run, they will have a peaceful environment to operate.\n\nChairman of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, in his remarks, stated that the real fundamental and basic thing to driving energy security and sufficiency in the country was to create the enabling environment for investment.",
