          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Henry Ojelu\n\nThe Nigerian Press Organisation, NPO has said that full implementation of the Governor el-Rufai and Oronsaye committee reports on restructuring will go a long way in tackling the security challenges in the country.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of its meeting on the state of the nation held on May 21, the organisation, which comprises the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria, NPAN, the Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE and the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, advised the federal government to immediately implement the report of the two committees which had proffered far-reaching solutions to the current challenges in Nigeria.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, signed by NPO President, Kabiru Yusuf, NGE President, Mustapha Isa and NUJ President, Chris Isiguzo, also identified high cost of governance, overbearing centre and several other factors as triggers for the current socio-political, economic and security challenges in the country.\n\nThe organisation also appealed to politicians and state actors to minimise their inflammatory rhetoric in order to reduce tension and ease the growing sense of fear among the people.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 read: \u201cWe, leaders of the media and major stakeholders in the Nigeria Project, given the responsibility imposed on us by Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, state as follows :That we believe in the oneness of Nigeria and that its population of about 200 million people, if resources are well managed, have innumerable advantages \u2013 both in economic and soft power, and that this should not be sacrificed on the altar of ethnic or tribal chauvinism.\n\n\u201cThat one of the triggers for the current socio-political, economic, and security challenges in the country is high cost of governance, reflected in the outrageous allowances and flamboyant lifestyles of our political leaders.\n\n\u201cThese leaders, rather erroneously, misconstrue public service for primitive accumulation of wealth, instead of its being a platform for galvanising development and satisfying the collective aspiration of our people for quality life in a safe and secure environment. One of the consequences of this ostentatious lifestyle is the new craze among a growing number of youths that the end justifies the means in their quest for easy wealth.\n\n\u201cThat in a federal system of government, particularly in a country like Nigeria which is diverse in ethnicity, culture, and religion, an overbearing centre is counterproductive to the development of the centre itself and the component units.\n\nTo leave the Federal Government with 68 items under the Exclusive Legislative List, including policing, is a recipe for unending destructive tension in the struggle for advantage among the federating units. It explains why our country is seemingly overwhelmed by non-state actors engaged in criminality and separatist agitations.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cGiven the above, we call on the federal government to immediately take steps at devolving powers to the component units by implementing the El Rufai Committee Report, which among others, recommends State Policing, in addition to other far reaching adjustments to the structure of governance. The continued delay to implement the report after its recommendations has been approved by all the organs of the ruling All Progressives Party, in line with the manifesto for which the party sold itself to win the 2015 election is self-defeating. We hold that its implementation will curb the galloping rate of criminality, reduce tension across the country, and reset the bottom of development.\u201d\n\n\u201cImplement the Orosanye Report, which provides a veritable road map for arresting the unsustainable high cost of governance. A reduced cost of governance will free substantial funds to fight insecurity, provide social safety nets for the generality of the people, fund developmental projects, and stem the current penchant for external and local borrowing by government.\n\n\u201cPut pressure on the National Assembly to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill, (PIB), which has gone into our history as the longest bill to ever go through legislative processes. It is of common knowledge that the petroleum industry has been long overdue for an overhaul and the passage of the bill will be a major boost. That the bill has stayed this long in the National Assembly militates against improved corporate governance in the oil sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to avoid the debt overhang inherent in excessive borrowing. We are aware that borrowing is good so long as such loans are deployed to funding enduring development projects, within the GDP ratio. However, the current borrowing in the face of the slide in the value of the country\u2019s number one revenue earner-oil remains worrisome.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

The Northern elders also urged the President to \u201cimprove his levels of competence, awareness that the nation is sliding into disaster, and sensitivity to the frustrations of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Forum further urged the Southern governors to be clear in their condemnation of alleged efforts by secessionists and criminals to exterminate federal presence and northerners from the region.\n\nNEF aslso accused Northern governors of receding into irrelevance through their purported silence over multiple assaults on Northern communities in the south where they also had equal rights to security and dignity. The statement read: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum(NEF) is convinced that it is time to respond to issues that threaten our collective security and the unity and integrity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has held back on joining issues with persons and groups intent on provoking the type of crises that will escalate beyond control or mitigation by leaders who are collectively showing definite signs that they are unwilling to steer the country away from the dangerous threats which are crippling it.\n\nSouthern govs building ethnic monster\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that elected people sworn to protect the constitution and protect the unity and integrity of Nigeria have decided to surrender to deeply divisive or outrightly irredentist and secessionist tendencies and movements.\n\n\u201cIn the South East, governors are yielding their political turf and mandates to secessionists, criminals and subversives who think they can exterminate federal presence and northerners from the region, and achieve dubious political goals related to 2023, or break away from the country.\n\n\u201cIn the South West, elected leaders and pampered ethnic bullies are closing ranks to provide a front that apes the do-what-we-want-or-we-leave-the-country strategy of the marginalized leaders of the South East.\n\n\u201cThe South South is squeezed between fear and uncertainty, and its leaders are gambling that they can benefit from further weakening the federal administration and the North if it rides along with the rest of the South.\n\n\u201cGovernors are building ethnic monsters and hiding behind them to whip up sentiments in a crude attempt to extract concessions no one is in a position to give or guarantee. \u201cA plastic unity is being contrived to create the impression that the entire South is united behind shared grievances against the Presidency and Fulani herders and all northerners who are cast as fair game in responding to all of President Buhari\u2019s multiple failures.\n\nAttempts to split North\n\n\u201cA desperate but futile attempt is being made to split the North along lines that suit people who ignore its complexities and plurality when it is convenient to lump all Northerners and submit them to humiliation or attacks. \u201cThe NEF recognizes that most of these provocations feed from the widespread perception of a weak national leadership and a broken political process that has become captive of narrow political interests.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the forum restates its support for a programmed transition that will eliminate open grazing and the establishment of productive, safe and sustainable options in managing our huge national asset in animal husbandry. This cannot be achieved with threats and harassment, but with commitment and collaboration involving all governments and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interests to support an urgent national initiative that will engineer a safe and productive transition to the end of open grazing.In the meantime, the forum must warn those attacking and killing Fulani headers to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are limits to every community\u2019s tolerance, and the forum strongly advises that lines are respected in the manner we treat Nigerians who are vulnerable wherever they live.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cThe forum has always supported initiatives that improve the quality of inputs into how Nigerians can address the limitations in the manner the country is operated.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is unfortunate that the current efforts of the National Assembly to amend the constitution enjoys little or no confidence among Nigerians that they will address the fundamental challenges which need to be comprehensively addressed, although this can be redressed if our elected representatives recognize the historic opportunities they have to move this country beyond its strangulating challenges.\n\nNegative attitude of Presidency\n\n\u201cThe negative attitude of the Presidency towards engaging Nigerians to tap into ideas, grievances and goodwill of many citizens who mean well is ill-informed and, under our current circumstances, dangerous. \u201cSo are postures that issue opportunistic ultimatums over convening national dialogue by the President. The forum supports a citizen-driven national dialogue and a campaign to get the government to accord its outcome the respect it deserves.\n\n\u201cThe forum extends its hands to groups that genuinely believe that Nigerians should demand and design the type of country we want, and should not wait for people we elected to set the boundaries and conditions of our existence. \u201cThe forum restates that the North will not be cowed and stampeded into escorting political ambitions of politicians at the cost of its rights, security and dignity.\n\n\u201cIt demands that President Buhari asserts the powers our constitution gives him to protect our territorial integrity and secure citizens, or accept that he is incapable of leading the nation through these unprecedented challenges.\n\n\u201cIf our country is to survive its current difficulties and build a better nation, President Buhari must improve his levels of competence, awareness that the nation is sliding into disaster and sensitivity to the frustrations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOther political leaders who take advantage of the limitations of the President to light fires should know that they will get burnt in them. Attacks on lawful Fulani and other Northerners in the South must stop, and those who have killed them must be brought to book.\n\n\u201cThe nation needs to know that Northerners in many parts of the South now live in heightened fear as they are profiled and harassed by elements in host communities who believe that there are no consequences for their actions. The forum demands an end to attacks on federal agents and facilities.\n\n\u201cOverwhelming majority of Nigerians do not want war or an end to our union. We just want an end to insecurity, escalating cost of living and the hate and the fear which our leaders are triggering.\n\nNorthern govs\u2019 silence\n\n\u201cGovernors in the South must be unambiguous in their condemnation and resistance against these dangerous activities. They cannot continue to walk on both sides of the street.\n\n\u201cNorthern governors should note that they are rapidly receding into irrelevance as desperate citizens chalk up their silence over multiple assaults in a country where they have equal rights to their security and dignity.\n\n\u201cThe forum restates its readiness to engage any group of Nigerians in exploring productive paths to a better future. What it will not do is to watch as the North is damaged further by cynical southern politicians and adventurers who think the North is too weak to protect its own interests.\n\n\u201cThe forum once again condoles the nation and families of Lt-Gen I Attahiru and other military officers who died in active duty. May God bestow His Mercies on their souls.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "2023: Gov Bello's presidential ambition dead on arrival",
          "text": "When Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State officially stated that he was under severe pressure to contest for the number one seat of the country, many Nigerians including Kogites had expressed missed reactions on the true intention of the Ebira born politician ahead of the 2023 Presidential race.\n\nDAILY POST in this report, takes a look at the political calculations of Gov. Bello, and the possibility of achieving his presidential ambition, as some analysts have maintained that his ambition is a gimmick, which is dead on arrival following his antecedents in Kogi State since he assumed power in 2016.\n\nSince Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State came into political limelight after the demise of Prince Abubakar Audu in 2015, he has continued to maintain that his administration has witnessed tremendous achievements.\n\nBello, popularly called the \u2018White Lion\u2019 by most of his supporters over times has reminded Kogites that his administration put an end to God fatherism and has ensured that the old folks who do not believe in the Ebigo agenda ( Ebira, Igala and Okun) are sent into Political extinction.\n\nThe Governor who is running his second term in office in several press conference said he has improved the security network of Kogi State as residents now sleep with their two eyes closed, compared to the way he met it in 2015. In health care delivery, infrastructural development, education, worker\u2019s welfare, Bello averred that no administration can beat his record. Does Bello\u2019s statement translate to reality in Kogi State?\n\nREASONS AND PERMUTATIONS BEHIND HIS AMBITION\n\nNigeria\u2019s next presidential election is about 632 days from today going by what was released to Nigerians by the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, in April 2021.\n\nThough the election is still many months away, politicians interested in the number one seat of the country have started building forces, bracing old political slogans like the consistent call for restructuring, power shift and the unending quest for youths to be given the opportunity to lead the nation.\n\nPotential aspirants have started testing the waters by sending out their foot soldiers, to start mobilising support for them across the 774 Local Governments in Nigeria.\n\nOne of the early birds for the 2023 Presidential race is governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya AlBello.\n\nGovernor Bello who was born on June 18, 1975 in Okene, Kogi State, the youngest of six children says it is time for the youths to take over the mantle of leadership in the country.\n\nBello, who strongly believes that he is a youth opined that, his style of leadership will help to transform the gains of President Muhammadu Buhari who is billed to vacate Aso rock in 2023.\n\nAs the youngest Governor in the current political dispensation of the country, Bello said his constituency, (the youths) wants him to serve and transform the nation just the way he has done in Kogi State.\n\nIn a recent interview with a national television, Bello affirmed this saying Nigerians, including the youths and women, are asking him to run for the office of the president.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe it is high time that we look into capacity, who can do the job, who is going to unify this country. And I think they are seeing something in me that they are asking me to come and unite and fix this country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe country no doubt is facing the most horrific moment of insecurity since the end of the Nigeria Civil War in 1970. It is against this backdrop that some sections of the country are calling for secessions.\n\nThis according to Gov. Bello is a setback for the most populous black nation in the world as he emphasized that his Presidential ambition will not only bring together the broken pieces of the country but will also ensure that the citizens are given sense of belonging again.\n\nAside that, Bello according to sources is also banking his ambition on the support he is getting from the Presidency since 2015. Bello is a classmate, course mate and great friend of Aisha Buhari, the wife of the president.\n\nThe relationship between Governor Yahaya Adoza Bello of Kogi state and the current President of Nigeria is a tight one as no one could dare to dispute the reality behind it.\n\nBello has cemented his ground to the extent that no one could dare step on his feet without the intervention from above. Bello is a strong stakeholder of the APC.\n\nAnother calculation from the camp of Governor Bello is that it is time for the North Central to Produce the next President. To buttress this step, the current speaker of the Kogi State House of Assembly, Prince Mathew Kolawole recently toured some northern States of the country begging for their support to give Bello a chance to pilot the affairs of the country.\n\nIn a recent meeting with the Speaker, Plateau State House of Assembly, Abok Ayuba, Kolawole and his colleagues solicited for their support for Bello\u2019s ambition.\n\n\u201cOur mission in Plateau is to congratulate the Speaker, Plateau House of Assembly, Abok Ayuba on his election as the Chair of North-Central zone of Speakers Conference of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are also here to brief him and canvass support for his Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, the Governor of Kogi State, who is the youngest governor in Nigeria to run for president come 2023.\n\n\u201cIn view of our relationship with our governor, as legislators, we have articulated all his achievements in the areas of security, women empowerment, youth inclusion in government, education and infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cWe have found him to be suitable as he has performed creditably well.\n\n\u201cOn this note, we decided on our own, to pass a vote of confidence on him and at the same time, pass a resolution that we want him to contest for the position of the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe youths of Nigeria are also putting pressure on him to contest for the position of the President of Nigeria and he has finally agreed,\u201d he said.\n\nKOGITES REACT\n\nKogites have continued to react to the presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. While many are of the opinion that his aspiration will bring blessing to the people of Kogi State, others are of the view that the ambition of him becoming the president of this country will be a curse for the people of Nigeria.\n\nWhile his presidential ambition is highly applauded by his political appointees, members of the All Progressive Congress, (APC), lawmakers, people of his senatorial districts, including the Eastern and the Western region, it is not the same for others who strongly believed that since the Governor came on board in 2016, Kogi State is now several steps backwards.\n\nSpeaking to DAILY POST on Tuesday, a resident who identified himself as Shehu commended Bello for standing tall among his peers to contest for the number one seat of the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy that our Governor is coming out to contest in 2023. With this, we are very optimistic that more development will be attracted to Kogi State. He is a unifier per excellence. He knows what it takes to be a leader and what should be done for Nigeria to come back to its feet again. No doubt things are very rough now, but I am confident that my Governor will change the narrative as a youth when he gets to power.\u201d\n\nAnother Kogites Fatima Ademu in her view opined that Nigerians should wake up and not allow the country to be led again by those who have been holding power over four decades.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer pretend that all is well when power is still recycled in the hands of these old, fraudulent and deceptive politicians who are out there for their own selfish.\n\n\u201c It is time to say no to God fatherism and any other manipulation from these old politicians who have nothing to offer but giving us fake promises that will never materialize. We need a youth President like Alhaji Yahaya Bello,\u201d She said.\n\nChristopher Oni, an APC stakeholder in the state said in view of the Not Too Young to Rule and Political Paradigm Shift, Governor Bello is the best bet come 2023.\n\nHe explained further that \u201cNigeria has capable youths that could chart the course for a great nation but the challenge is that they have been abandoned. There is a lot to give us concern as a nation about the way our country is being run, because we have able and capable young men and women out there.\n\n\u201c Gov. Bello is endowed with innovative ideas, an astute public administrator, a vibrant , forthright dynamic, competent, highly resourceful, a visionary leader, bridge builder and exemplary role model.\n\n\u201cGYB\u2019s sterling and enduring legacies in governance in Kogi State is an eye opener and a pointer that young men should be entrusted with mantle of leadership in public governance\u201d.\n\nOthers who spoke to DAILY POST had a contrary view. According to a Civil Servant who did not want his name mentioned, if Bello becomes President, Nigerian workers will be forced to lick his feet to get their monthly pay.\n\n\u201cI am a Civil servant but it looks as if I am not working. I have been collecting percentage Salary since Bello came on board. Many of us are suffering and smiling. We can\u2019t say anything, else they will come after us. This same person is now telling us that he wants to become President. On what ground?\n\n\u201cSomebody that cannot manage one state which consist of 21 Local Government Area, wants to control 36 States which is made up of 774 Local Government Area and the Federal Capital territory. What will he say are his achievements in Kogi State that would qualify him to lead this country?\n\n\u201cIs it the bad roads, lack of electricity, abandoned projects, dilapidated structures, inconsistent payment of workers\u2019 salaries, poor health services and many more. I think he is just a joker and knows within himself that he is not fit to become a Local Government Chairman in view of the suffering Kogites have witnessed since his administration came on board.\u201d\n\nLaughing over the recent move by Governor Bello to run for Presidency, another resident who identified himself as Ocholi Ahmed insisted that Kogi State remains the worst governed state in Nigeria.\n\nHe described Governor Bello\u2019s ambition as the joke of the century and should not be taken seriously by Nigerians who truly know the political calculation of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhenever I see people campaigning for GYB to PYB I laugh. This is because this is the biggest joke of the century. I can\u2019t imagine that our Governor will come out to tell the whole world that he is under pressure to contest for presidency. Who is pressurizing him? Certainly not me. May be his political appointees and those set of people enjoying him. They are the ones drumming for him to succeed President Buhari.\n\n\u201dI strongly believe that if you look deeply into the minds of many Kogites and Nigerians in general, he will be outrightly rejected. Look at the opinion poll recently conducted. It speaks for itself about his aspiration. They say charity begins at home. What does he have to show that he is truly qualified to run the affairs of over 200 million Nigerians? Whoever that is deceiving him should stop. He knows that becoming the President is not a child\u2019s play.\u201d\n\nLeadership Style\n\nGovernor Bello, since he came on board in 2016 assumed the role of the leader of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) in the State.\n\nThe governor according to political analysts in the state decides who and who forms his cabinet and who should be elected into various elective position both at the National Assembly, State Assembly and Local Government Area. Any individual who kicks against his philosophy will be booted out.\n\nA political analyst who never wanted his name to be mentioned told DAILY POST that, \u201cWhen Gov. Bello was elected in 2015, the then APC excos led by Haddy Ametuo was shown the exit door when they were not on the good book of the government. The current administration immediately ensured that the excos that will be under his control is constituted.\n\n\u201cIt is still fresh in our memories about the ordeals of former Assembly lawmaker from Igalamela Odolu, Elder Friday Sanni Makama (although now in APC) who was beaten black and blue at the Assembly Complex.\n\n\u201cAfter that day, he couldn\u2019t gain access to the chamber to represent his constituency. What about the immediate past Speaker of the Assembly Rt Hon. Ahmed Imam? We could still remember how he left that position. We can still remember how the former Deputy Governor, elder Simon Achuba was wrongfully impeached under this present administration in Kogi State. This are some of the few cases I could remember.\u201d\n\nDAILY POST, however, gathered that all the 25 seats at the State House of Assembly are members of the All Progressive Congress, (APC).\n\nAlso, three senators representing Kogi State at the National Assembly are members of the ruling All Progressive Congress, (APC). Over 80 percent of the house of representative\u2019s members from Kogi State are members of the ruling party.\n\nThis was also replicated at the December 2020 council polls where all the chairmanship and councilor seats are all occupied by members of the ruling party.\n\nGov Bello vs Kogi Workers\n\nDuring Governor Bello\u2019s first tenure between 2016-2019 in Kogi State, he had a strain relationship with Kogi workers. Bello and the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress, (NLC) led by Comrade Onuh Edoka and the Trade Union Congress, (TUC), Comrade Ronti Ojo were at loggerhead over poor welfare of workers and pensioners.\n\nIt could be recalled that on Sept. 22nd 2017, the organized labour in Kogi State began an indefinite strike as the only lifeline left for the workers to negotiate their survival in the hands of the administration of Gov. Yahaya Bello.\n\nLabour demanded among others, full payments of salary and allowances to workers being owed between two and 21 months\u2019 arrears. The workers also demanded payment of outstanding leave, yearly incremental allowances and reinstatement of workers unjustly treated during the concluded screening exercise.\n\nLabour bombarded the government for its poor attitude to workers\u2019 welfare , saying that never in the history of the state had civil service recorded the massive hunger -induced deaths as being witnessed currently.\n\n\u201cWorkers and pensioners are going through trauma, anguish, pains, sickness, penury, truncation of children\u2019s education, huge unsettled house rent/medical bills. We must rise against these now or never,\u201d the organized labour said.\n\nAlthough the Organized Labour in March 2021, suspended its proposed strike over the implementation of the new minimum wage, the State NLC Chairman, Comrade Onuh Edoka in his May Day speech openly declared that Kogi workers are fully in support of the Presidential ambition of Governor Bello.\n\nHe, however, reminded the governor to address some of the challenges of State and Local workers ranging from poor remunerations, percentage salaries at the local government level, lifting of ban on union activities at the various higher institution, amongst other.\n\nStakeholders react\n\nMeanwhile, some political stakeholders in the state have admitted that the presidential ambition of Governor Bello is highly suspicious. While some APC loyalist are of the view that the governor means business and won\u2019t back out from the presidential race, others are of the view that Gov. Bello is only pulling out a publicity stunt to gain political relevance in 2023.\n\nDeji Adeyanju, a popular Abuja-based activist, in a series of tweets which was published by DAILY POST on 29th March, 2021 pointed out that Bello was only tricking people into believing he\u2019s contesting for the presidency.\n\nAccording to Adeyanju: \u201cYahaya Bello is contesting for Ministerial position in 2023 and not president. I only feel sorry for those that have fallen for his tricks.\u201d\n\nA political analyst based in Lokoja, Isaac Amode aligned himself with the position of the Abuja based activist. Amode explained the Governor is only hiding under the guise of the youth but knows deeply within himself that he lacks the capacity to handle the affairs of Nigerians at this trying moment of the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI\u2019m not against the presidential ambition of his excellency. We just have to be realistic with ourselves. Does he have the capacity to lead the country now? To me, he is just pulling up shows simply because he has the money to do so. I would advise Governor Bello to channel his energy on how to make Kogi State move forward and not an ambition he knows won\u2019t come to pass.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is a distraction from his work in Kogi State. He can only get support from a section of the people in the state and not all. For him to think that he is the right man to lead this nation come 2023, somebody should kindly tell him to wake up from his dream.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the opposition People Democratic Party, (PDP) described the intention of the Governor to contest for the President as not only laughable but appalling. A chat with the State Publicity Secretary, Bode Ogunmola queried that \u201cthis is a joke taken too far. How can you come out to contest when you have underperformed in your own State? What will he tell electorates that he has done that would make them vote for him in the next general election?\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, The Kogi State Chairman, Conference of Nigeria Political Party, (CNPP), Mohammed Kabir Abdullahi described Bello\u2019s presidential ambition as a phantom project that is dead on arrival. He told DAILY POST that the Governor\u2019s move for presidency was based on imagination.\n\n\u201c The governor\u2019s move on this phantom project is not achievable. It can\u2019t go anywhere. The State is suffering. The State is seeking for attention of the governor. We seek his attention here in Kogi State than what he is doing. For over one year, the governor has not spent a full month in Kogi State. So his ambition is causing more harm in the state. His ambition is a trick.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear. The founding fathers of the APC are clamoring for a good national chairman. How many Governors or people from North Central are with him on this project? How many Senators from North Central are with him on this project?\n\n\u201cIt is just a gimmick. Apart from his few cartels, his Chief of Staffs, appointees and many more that are with him, how many notable Nigerians have come out to say we stand with Yahaya Bello apart from retarded celebrities, footballers, that cannot even make a delegate of their party. My brother, it is a gimmick,\u201d he said.\n\nAn APC supporter in the state identified as Isaiah told DAILY POST on Tuesday that \u201cGovernor Yahaya Bello has distinguish himself for excellence in the comity of Governors in Nigeria because of his unprecedented achievement in security, infrastructures, youths and women inclusiveness in public governance, religious tolerance, community and human capital development.\n\n\u201cBased on his track records of impacts in Kogi State in term of credible, responsible and purposeful leadership, occasion demands that Governor Bello should be entrusted with the mandate to pilot the affairs of our dear nation, Nigeria come 2023\u201d.\n\nThe Kogi State Deputy Governor, Chief Edward Onoja had reaffirmed the aspiration of Gov. Bello to contest for the 2023 Presidential election.\n\nSpeaking recently during the inauguration of Committee Members of the Chief Edward David Onoja for Governor Yahaya Bello to President Yahaya Bello (CEDO 4 GYB2PYB), the Deputy Governor said, the CEDO 4 GYB2PYB Project shares in the ideologies of existing support groups like the GYB2PYB, Bello Ambassadors Network (BAN), the North Central Youth Group, amongst many others, envisioned to reinforce the clarion call on the Kogi Governor for the national assignment.\n\nOnoja added that there was a need to galvanize Nigerians across board to deepen the call on Governor Bello to replicate his lofty achievements in Kogi State on the national scale given his laudable antecedents.\n\nHe identified the core challenges of insecurity and disunity, which according to him, have led to increased poverty, and by effect, suffocates the chances for prosperity in the land.\n\nHe disclosed that Governor Bello has proven beyond reasonable doubts to the realization of Kogi People, his unshaken stance against insecurity and genuine efforts to unify them across ethnic, religious and class divides.\n\nThe Deputy Governor admonished members of the project to walk the talk, saying its uniqueness, asides raising consciousness through countdowns, lies majorly on effective communication, collaboration and networking with Nigerians to actualize the \u201cDivine Project.\u201d",

The new agreement will also help to re-balance fiscal terms and address global competition in prioritisation of investments by key players.\n\nThe OML 118 with its straddle fields boast of the presence of the five major players in the deepwater space not only in Nigeria but also globally.\n\nOML 118 is the first major deepwater development in Nigeria in the deepwater Niger Delta 75 kilometres from shore containing the Bonga fields at water depth over 1000m.\n\nThe fields are one of the most prolific deep-water assets in the country, boosting of almost two billion barrels of crude oil, up to 1TCF of gas, modest cost of operations and delivers a significantly level of profit for the investors with a sizeable take for the state. The field also supplies gas to NLNG another strategically important asset to NNPC and its partners.\n\nThe NNPC had in February 2019 signed Heads of Terms (HoT) with the OML 118 PSC contractors, which formed the commercial framework for parties to settle their differences, create pathway for a sustainable brighter future and a reference point for resolving the industry-wide PSC disputes.\n\nThe key feature of the terms of settlement include, clear terms on block ring-fencing, gas commercialisation terms, replacement of disputed tax credits for clearer investment allowances, trade-offs on in-block consolidation and cost limits, early lease renewals, assurance of fiscal stability for investors, protection of profit sharing schemes and settlement of disputed past, among others.\n\nThe objective was that the HoT would translate to fully termed agreements including the Dispute Resolution Agreement and a new PSC Agreement for the OML 118 Contract Area.",

Be a good debtor. Pay up your debt. If you refuse to pay, you won\u2019t step into that bank again\u201d, he said.\n\nEmefiele reckoned that a nexus exists between food security and national security, urging the Federal Government to make good its promise of solving the insecurity challenge; which has led to a scathing spike in food prices following a drop in crop production and disruption of supply chains.\n\nEmefiele said: \u201cSecurity challenges and the economy are interconnected. If the economy is to grow, insecurity must be low. If not, the economy will suffer regardless of our efforts. But the chief of defence staff has assured us of security. Some parts of the northwest are saying they are seeing results of military efforts. Efforts now targeted the southeast and southwest.\n\n\u201cAgain, the United States and the Federal Government, as a way of boosting security, signed a pact for the supply of 12 Tucano airplanes out of which would help us solve our insecurity. I am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August. They are coming.

You just brought one or two people here who said things that nobody said from our own end. Did the president say he didn\u2019t support\u2026? He\u2019s opposed to the way the governors have chosen to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn state policing, Shehu said the president was initially concerned that governors who are unable to pay salaries to their workers want to give guns to police set up by them, adding that if it is what Nigerians want, the president would have no option but to support it.\n\n\u201cYou hire a policeman. Give him a gun and for one year, you don\u2019t pay salaries, like you are doing to your teachers, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Shehu stated.\n\nBesides, he added that to implement state policing will require amending the 1999 Constitution, and Buhari has never rejected constitution amendments.\n\nOn restructuring, he stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) wasn\u2019t against devolution of power, as that is the work of the legislature to do.\n\nHe also dismissed speculations that Buhari was interested in extending his tenure, saying that those raising doubts over whether or not elections will hold in 2023 are doing so because they are unelectable.\n\nShehu also said he was not aware of any shoot-on-sight order against Igbo, adding that the rumour is meant to provoke unnecessary public anger.\n\nSouthern Govs Insist No Land for Invaders\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday faulted Monday\u2019s presidential statement querying the legality of the governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Special Duties and Strategies, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, said Shehu could not be representing the presidency with his positions on issues of national concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnyone who has been following the utterances of this man (Shehu), as well as his fellow travellers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy cannot but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShehu cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u2018lasting solutions,\u2019 which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge.\n\n\u201cMr. Garba contends that \u2018their announcement is of questionable legality\u2019, referring to the 17 governors of the Southern states, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u2018gun-wielding \u2018killer herdsmen\u2019 and their families, and provide \u2018veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families, including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u2019 for which \u2018the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u2019, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said Shehu wanted to revive forest reserves \u201cbut seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories. They must take instructions from appointees of the federal government on such matters,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile noting the rights of all Nigerians to move freely in all parts of the country as guaranteed by the constitution, Akeredolu said it was clear that Shehu seemed to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under the law.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiousness and mischief.\n\n\u201cMost traditional families in Nigeria have occupations. Pastoralism is not an exception. Any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism may be assisted to embrace modernity.\n\n\u201cDispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u2018side-by-side\u2019 with other communities cannot be for the purpose of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cIt raises suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land. Mr. Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land.\n\n\u201cMay, we warn Mr. Garba Shehu and his cohorts to desist from hurling insults at the elected representatives of the people. He lacks the authority to make policy statements for the federal government, unless directed, expressly. His acts are clearly those of an agent provocateur.\n\n\u201cNo inch of the space delineated and known, currently, as South-west, and indeed the whole South, will be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nOrtom Condemns Moves to Reopen Grazing Reserves\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has condemned the moves by the presidency to reopen grazing reserves.\n\nThe governor said in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, that he read with concern a statement issued by Shehu in which he said the federal government would commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that there is a hidden agenda, which only the presidency knows. Otherwise, all the regions of the country have accepted the fact that open grazing of animals is no longer fashionable and should be banned to pave the way for ranching, yet, the government at the centre is insistent that grazing reserves/cattle routes must be created across the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nOrtom added that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had on February 9 agreed that open grazing was no longer sustainable, in view of growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nHe accused the presidency of pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of the 1950s and 60s, adding that the presidency\u2019s endorsement of open grazing has emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all land in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original landowners.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities,\u201d he added.\n\nACF Maintains Stand on Open Grazing Ban\n\nAlso reacting to the presidency\u2019s rejection of the ban on open grazing by the Southern governors, spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, said the Chairman of the forum, Chief Audu Ogbe, had earlier made the position of the forum known.\n\n\u201cOur stand on the issue was already made known by our Chairman, Audu Ogbe, in a statement he issued on May 17, 2021,\u201d he said while responding to THISDAY\u2019s inquiry.\n\nOgbe, in the statement, had said that the decision to ban open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cACF does not see any reason to object to a decision taken in the best interest of all.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that the crisis emanates from the belief by most herdsmen that they are free to enter any farm, eat up the crops, and rape or kill anyone raising objections. Nobody or society can accept that.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the presidential statement opposing the ban on open grazing showed that Buhari\u2019s government was not organised.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said reacting to Shehu\u2019s statement again would amount to dignifying him.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving reacted to the statement of the Attorney-General, I consider it infra dignitatem to still countenance Garba Shehu whose statement, claiming the president\u2019s authority, on the same ban on open grazing does not only show how unorganised the Buhari government is, but also a vote of no confidence on the AGF, who should save the honour of his office and the legal profession by resigning pronto.\u201d\n\nSANs Knock Presidency, Allege Ethnic Bias\n\nSome senior lawyers have faulted the position of the presidency on the open grazing ban in the South.\n\nSome of them described the president\u2019s statement as parochial, sectional and one that is capable of further tearing the country apart.\n\nMr. John Baiyesea (SAN), who described the statement as part of the bizarre situation the country is dealing with, wondered if such could ever emanate from Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, such statements are often made under the cover of the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is doubtful if the president knows about such annoying statements, which seem to suggest that he has narrowed his office to the North. I don\u2019t believe that the president will personally support one ethnic group against another or wilfully diminish the scope of his authority. I don\u2019t think he will make himself so irrelevant as president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if the president\u2019s silence to such tribalistic and ethnic posturing of his appointees means acquiescence or approval, then the country is endangered.\n\n\u201cHow many times are they to be told (for them to understand), that freedom of movement guaranteed by the constitution is for human beings and not for cows, or animals?\n\n\u201cAs long as Fulani herdsmen stay within the law, their freedom of movement is guaranteed. But their cows do not enjoy the same constitutional rights or protections.\n\n\u201cExcept for the mischievous intentions of these government officials who are bent on dividing this country, it is too elementary that the constitutional system does not give the rights of people to animals,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, advised the federal government to be careful not to allow the horrors experienced in Rwanda and Burundi to happen in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN), faulted the presidency, saying that the Southern governors acted within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe added: \u201cI do not agree with him for the simple reason that it is not in tandem with my previously expressed view that the governors were right in their decision to ban open grazing.\n\n\u201cIn a constitutional setting as ours, the issue may have to be referred to the judicial arm of government for resolution. Until that is done, the governors are at liberty to stick to their position.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also faulted the presidency and advised the government to study the Grazing Reserves Act of 1964, which provides for the establishment and operation of grazing reserves in the North.\n\nHe said since there was a popular demand for the proscription of open grazing, efforts should be made to immediately establish ranches.\n\n\u201cIt smacks of brazen official impunity on the part of the presidency to have said that the ban on open grazing is of doubtful legality. Last Friday, the Federal High Court ruled that state governments have the power to enact anti-grazing laws,\u201d he stated.\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), accused Malami of ill-advising the president against the stance of the Southern governors.\n\nHe challenged the federal government to sue the governors if it is convinced that their position is legally flawed\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari has obviously been ill-advised on the well thought out Southern governors\u2019 stance against open grazing by the attorney-general whose views were made known only two days ago. Buhari, with all humility, is quite wrong to say the Southern governors\u2019 stance is an act of questionable legality.\n\n\u201cIf the federal government feels strongly and sure about its puritanical, but legally flawed stance, I challenge the federal government to challenge the governors\u2019 resolutions by suing all the state governors of Nigeria, through the invocation of the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under section 232(1) of the 1999 Constitution\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 military officers and personnel.\n\nThe Kaduna aircraft crash, the third of such incident in the last three months involving NAF fleet, has raised concerns about the airworthiness of the aircraft the NAF has.\n\nThree NAF aircraft were involved in fatal crashes in Abuja, Borno and in Kaduna in the last three months, claiming the lives of a total of 21 personnel of the air force and the army.\n\nHowever, the air force, last week, inducted three newly procured JF-17 thunder aircraft into its inventory as part of activities to mark its 57th anniversary celebration and is expecting 12 Super Tucano fighter jets from the United State, which delivery is due by 2022.\n\nThere were also claims that of the four major Beechcraft planes in the force, notably, NAF 201, NAF 202, NAF 203 and NAF 204, two, NAF 201and NAF 203 had crashed in Abuja and Kaduna, remaining NAF 202 and NAF 204.\n\nThere have also been trending calls on the social media for the air force to ground the remaining two.\n\nBut the air force has insisted that the planes are in good conditions.\n\nThe air force, in a statement by its spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the committee, comprising serving and retired officers, would, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations.\n\nThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures.\n\nThe committee, chaired by the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, is expected to submit its report latest June 18.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has constituted a committee of serving and retired senior officers to conduct a safety audit of all Nigerian Air Force (NAF) operational and engineering units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations in the units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures.

          "text": "\u2022CBN raises COVID-19 targeted credit facility to N400bn\n\n\u2022Mulls introduction of digital currency\n\nBy James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday appealed to bandits and others involved in unlawful activities to drop their arms and embrace the central bank\u2019s Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP).\n\nHe also announced that the central bank has been encouraged to increase its COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility to N400 billion from N300 billion.\n\nEmefiele, while addressing journalists after a two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, also reiterated that cyptocurrency currently has no place in the Nigerian financial system.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the MPC resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as interest rate at 11.5 per cent.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR and left the Cash Reserve Ratio at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, his appeal to criminals to embrace family is because there is a linkage between security and economic growth.\n\nResponding to a question, he said: \u201cIf you want an economy to grow, the level of insecurity must be low because if there is a high level of insecurity like what we see today, the economy will suffer.\u201d\n\nHe added that security agencies are doing their best to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cEfforts are now targeted at the south-eastern and north-eastern parts of the country. About three years ago, the federal government and the United States signed a pact that resulted in a government-to-government acquisition of military equipment.\n\n\u201cOut of which, we are expecting 12 fighter planes that would help us solve our insecurity. I am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, would like to appeal to our brothers, who decide that they want to live in bushes and forests, that they should please, begin to retreat, drop their arms and come and embrace the anchor borrowers\u2019 programme.\n\n\u201cIf they do so, it will help them; if they choose not to do so, they will be confronted by the security as this battle continues.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic before the end of the year that the security challenges confronting the country will substantially abate,\u201d he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the current targeted facility, which was unveiled to provide succour to households and SMEs amidst the harsh impact of the pandemic, \u201calmost the whole of N300 billion has now been disbursed.\u201d\n\nHe said the proposed increase would make more available to households and small businesses for them, \u201cto go back to business which will ultimately yield employment and also grow our economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the idea of operating a digital currency will soon become a reality in the country, adding that the central bank has already set up its committee, which is working on the concept.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, said although the economy had successfully exited recession, the recovery was fragile given that the GDP of 0.51 per cent was still far below population growth rate.\n\nHe said the committee was therefore, of the view that, there was a need for monetary authorities to consolidate on all administrative measures taken not only to rein in inflation, but also on the actions so far taken to grow output.\n\nHe said in the committee\u2019s view, such measures should include boosting consumption and investments, as well as diversifying the base of the economy through FX restrictions for the importation of goods and food products that can be produced in Nigeria.\n\nThe MPC also urged the bank to continue to put in place measures that will boost export earnings.\n\nResponding to a question on the recent Q1 GDP figures, Emefiele said: \u201cI think it is important to say at the CBN we were not surprised. We were not surprised because Nigeria is one country that is peculiar for what I call a situation that is out of the ordinary. That is because Nigeria is one country among several others challenged by stagflation.\n\n\u201cStagflation is a situation where inflation is running high and prices are running high and at same time output growth is contracting. If you understand how this works, you will understand that as MPC, your core responsibility is to rein inflation by ensuring that you keep supreme your price stability mandate. And to do so means you have to tighten to rein inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, government is confronted with contracting output and the normal way to recover from such is to stimulate the economy by injecting liquidity into the system.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said on consumption and investment, the committee noted that the intervention facilities under the anchor borrowers programme was N631.4 billion granted to 3,107,949 small holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million of land hectares; for the AGSMEIS, N111.7 billion to 29,026 beneficiaries; and for the Targeted Credit Facility, N253.4 billion to 548,345 beneficiaries \u2013 comprising 470,969 households and 77,376 SMEs.\n\nThe committee, according to him, noted that notwithstanding that all these have helped in boosting output, the CBN should continue to aggressively increase its interventions in these subsectors, including agricultural processing and manufacturing.\n\nHe said under the National Youth Investment Fund, N2.04 billion was disbursed to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 were SMEs.\n\nAlso, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative, the CBN has disbursed N3.19 billion to 341 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, music and software development.\n\nAlso commenting on the recent controversy regarding state governments repaying their loan obligations to banks as well as those under the CBN intervention facilities, Emefiele said the state governors must honour their loan agreements to parties involved.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are two aspects to these. There are intervention facilities granted by the CBN and there are bilateral facilities granted by the deposit money banks to them.\n\n\u201cThey went to deposit money banks, they asked for loans, they signed the offer letters with those banks.\n\n\u201cThey gave their ISPOs to the federal ministry of finance that on a monthly basis, the minister of finance should deduct from their money and pay the banks for the loans they have taken.\n\n\u201cAnd I am aware that the banks have written to finance and they have copied me that they want their money.\n\n\u201cIf it was a bilateral loan agreement, in fact, there is privacy of contract, yes, I am not part of it, they should pay their loans.\n\n\u201cOn the CBN intervention facility to the state governments, we are engaging the National Economic Council (NEC) and CBN is also insisting on its loan to be paid.\n\n\u201cBut depending on the outcome of the engagement between CBN, finance and NEC, we will begin to take the monies but in any case it\u2019s good for you to be a good debtor \u2013 when you take a loan you pay so that when you go back to the bank, you can get. But if refuse to pay, you will never smell the doorstep of the banker again.\u201d\n\nHe said while the CBN had extended repayment on its loan interventions till next year as part of the forbearances to cushion the impact of the pandemic, banks deserved the right to demand repayment of their loan disbursements following the rebound in economic activities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn any case, the banks I must admit are seeking that there are some improvements in the economy, fragile as it may be- there are some improvements \u2013 crude prices have gone up and business activities are beginning to regain energy and life again.\n\n\u201cAnd if the banks ask for the repayment of their facilities, it will be justified.\n\n\u201cYou raised the issue of interest rates, that the banks are charging high interest rates. If we admit at CBN that we are controlling money supply and the banks raise interest rates in what I can call non-employment generating sectors or non-output generating sectors of the economy, we can\u2019t fault them.\n\n\u201cBecause we have our own intervention facility that are meant to target agriculture, SMEs and targeted households, which are meant to stimulate employment and also stimulate output for the country.\u201d\n\nOn whether the CBN had been vindicated following the crash of cryptocurrency market after the apex bank had opposed its operations in the country, Emefiele said it was not about CBN being vindicated.\n\nHe added that the CBN investigated and found out that a substantial percentage of Nigerians are involved in cryptocurrency which is \u201cnot the best.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, some may be legitimate but I dare say most are illegitimate and I will corroborate that. Under cryptocurrency and bitcoin, Nigeria comes second right? But in the global size of the economy, Nigeria comes 27th.\n\n\u201cSo do you think that there is some correlation? You think those countries whose economies are second and 26th will allow you to grow your cryptocurrency business to second position, if what is inside is a big deal that is going to profit everybody?\u201d\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cOf course, we saw it that the market collapsed\u2026Elon Musk twitted sometime about the time the CBN said our banking and payment infrastructure will no longer be available for cryptocurrency transactions \u2013 he twitted, that he was going to invest about $1.5 billion in crypto and the rates went to the highest roof.\n\n\u201cAnd he then twitted again and raised a fee concerns and the thing plunged. Elon Musk had himself decided that he will no longer deal in cryptos.\n\n\u201cAnd so if a man who felt it was good suddenly decides to say it\u2019s no longer good and then you\u2026don\u2019t forget, those who invented crypto said it is encrypted.\n\n\u201cWhen they say it\u2019s encrypted, it means that whatever is happening between me and you is only know to the two of us. And you know what? In case I defraud you because it is encrypted,y ou can\u2019t even disclose my name and you can\u2019t even get your money back.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CBN, while commending government\u2019s efforts in combating the headwinds imposed by the pandemic, advised against another nationwide lockdown as was experienced in 2020, adding that this will reverse the gains jointly achieved between the government and the apex bank in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nHe said the MPC assessed the options on direction of policy in the short to medium term and re-appraised current measures by the government to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and the general preparedness of relevant public health agencies to guard against the spread of the mutating strains of the virus.\n\nAccording to him, the committee noted the appropriate steps taken by the government to ensure that up to 70 per cent of the population get vaccinated to drastically drive down the infection rate in the country and hence, sustain economic activities.\n\nHe said:\u201dThe committee noted the persisting security crisis, especially in major food producing regions of the country and the severe toll on food supply and prices. It noted that inflation had moderated marginally due to the unrelenting effort of the bank in supporting agriculture to boost food supply and prices.\n\n\u201cThe committee, thus, reiterated its call to the government to intensify effort towards addressing the security situation in the country to ease supply bottlenecks and bring down food prices.\n\n\u201cThe MPC further noted government\u2019s commitment towards investing in public infrastructure despite constrained fiscal position and urged a continued focus on this objective, while exploring the option of effective partnership with the private sector, as improved road networks, telecommunications and power supply will greatly and proactively impact the supply chain and moderate price increments.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also stressed the need for collaboration with Nigeria\u2019s huge population living abroad, through the issuance of diaspora bonds targeted at specific infrastructure projects.\n\nThis is even as the committee noted that the public debt stock was currently high, it was of the view that project specific diaspora bond issues could conveniently pay itself back without imposing a burden on government finances.\n\nThe committee also noted the complementary role this would play in boosting foreign exchange supply, accretion to reserves and easing of the current exchange rate pressure.\n\nIn arriving at a decision to hold the rates, Emefiele said whereas the committee remained committed to supporting the efforts of the federal government in restorating the productive capacity of the economy, members remained much more focused towards achieving price stability in the short to medium-term.\n\nHe stated that economic growth could be hampered in an environment of unstable prices adding therefore, that the choice between loosening the stance of policy to ease credit further or tightening to moderate price development or maintaining a hold stance in order to allow previous policy measures continue to permeate the economy while observing global and domestic developments.\n\nHe said an expansionary stance of policy could transmit to reduced pricing of the loan portfolios of Deposit Money Banks and result, therefore, in cheaper credit to the real sector of the economy.\n\nHe added, however, that this expected transmission may be constrained by persisting security challenges and infrastructural deficits.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, while a contractionary stance will only address the monetary component of price development, supply side constraints such as the security crisis and infrastructural deficits can only be addressed by policies outside the purview of the central bank.\n\n\u201cA tight stance in the view of members, will also hamper the bank\u2019s objectives of providing low cost credit to households, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Agriculture, and other output growth and employment stimulating sectors of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "He also announced that the central bank has been encouraged to increase its COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility to N400 billion from N300 billion.\nAccording to Emefiele, his appeal to criminals to embrace family is because there is a linkage between security and economic growth.\nI am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August.\n\u201cI, therefore, would like to appeal to our brothers, who decide that they want to live in bushes and forests, that they should please, begin to retreat, drop their arms and come and embrace the anchor borrowers\u2019 programme.\n\u201cI am optimistic before the end of the year that the security challenges confronting the country will substantially abate,\u201d he stated.",

The State governors will not even allow this to fly. They will take the federal government to court for holding their money.

          "title": "Jo\u2019Burg, Marrakesh, Lagos: Which African cities have the highest internet speeds?",
          "text": "In a world of online gaming, Zoom meetings and video-on-demand streaming, internet speed is everything.\n\nTo watch Netflix in high-definition, your internet download speed must be at least 5 megabits per second (Mbps), while ultra-high-definition requires 25 Mbps. A clear and stable Facebook Live or Twitch stream requires an upload speed of up to 5 Mbps. On Zoom, group video calls in full HD require between 3 and 3.8Mbps.\n\nAs these services acquire more global audiences, the internet needs to be faster everywhere to provide uniform experiences to users. So how does speed vary within Africa, and when compared with countries outside the continent?\n\nSouth Africa leads mobile, Ghana fixed broadband\n\nUsers can test internet speed using a number of options. Netflix launched fast.com five years ago and it\u2019s a pretty handy tool. But to compare speeds across geographies, we will rely on data from Speedtest Global Index, a service owned by Ookla, a US-based internet analytics company.\n\nSpeedtest provides data for mobile and fixed broadband internet for more than 130 countries around the world. Mobile broadband is the connection available through SIM card-based network operators while fixed broadband typically requires a cable connection.\n\nAccording to their latest data for the first quarter of 2021, the global average for download speed is 53.38 Mbps for mobile and 102.12 Mbps for fixed broadband.\n\nAfrica\u2019s best performers scored below these marks. The best average speed for mobile internet in Africa was in South Africa (44.80 Mbps) while the mark for fixed broadband was in Ghana (51.93 Mbps).\n\nIn descending order, South Africa, Mali, Morocco, Cameroon, Tunisia, Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya (20.98 Mbps) were the top ten countries for mobile internet speeds in Africa in Q1 2021. The worst-ranked African country was Sudan (131st out of 134 overall) at 12.21 Mbps.\n\nThe top ten standings for fixed broadband are different: Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, South Africa, Madagascar, Egypt, Senegal, Seychelles, Morocco, Congo and Burkina Faso (23.81 Mbps). Guinea is the worst-ranked African country in this category (173rd out of 176 overall) with 6.66 Mbps.\n\nGhana leads on fixed mobile broadband\n\nSouth Africa, Egypt and Senegal appear in both top 10 lists. But which cities stand out across the continent? For this, we\u2019ll focus on mobile internet speeds and latency \u2013 a measure of how responsive an internet connection is.\n\nFrom Johannesburg to Kairouan\n\nSpeedtest shows the top cities for mobile internet speeds in South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Nigeria and Kenya, but not for other countries in the top ten \u2013 like Mali and Cameroon. As such, we are limited in how certain we are of the cities with the top internet speeds in Africa.\n\nHowever, we are able to guess that the major cities in South Africa, Morocco and Tunisia have the fastest speeds on the continent. Johannesburg leads the way with 55.64 Mbps while Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, comes in at 31.32 Mbps.\n\nIn Nigeria, Speedtest data shows Port-Harcourt \u2013 an oil-rich city in the Niger Delta region \u2013 has the fastest speed at 23.02 Mbps. Lagos, one of Africa\u2019s capitals of tech startups records an average of 19.72 Mbps \u2013 a lower mark than Nairobi (24.60) and Cape Town (36.68).\n\nWhere latency is concerned, Nigeria\u2019s main cities (Port-Harcourt, Lagos, Benin city, Kano, Ibadan) also lag behind main cities in comparable African countries.\n\nThe highest latency among South Africa\u2019s top five cities (Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Soweto) is 29 milliseconds. The highest among Kenya\u2019s top five is 39 milliseconds (in Eldoret). Latency is 40 milliseconds in Lagos but that\u2019s the least among Nigeria\u2019s top five. In Kano, the average is 75 milliseconds \u2013 more than twice the global average of 37 milliseconds.\n\nWhat are the numbers revealing to us?\n\nThe numbers above reflect internet performance between January and March 2021. As such, longer-term data will be needed to make better judgement.\n\nHowever, the numbers show a wide gap between internet speeds in Africa and the rest of the world. Africa has the fastest-growing mobile telecoms market but internet penetration is still at about 42%.\n\nLatency is not such a big deal if you are merely browsing social media, attending a Zoom meeting or streaming on Instagram. Anything below 100 ms is fine. But for gaming, between 20ms and 40ms is optimal.\n\nIncreasing download speeds and reducing latency will require more investment in infrastructure from telcos who provide mobile internet but also from fibre optic providers. On the mobile side of things, it means expanding 4G coverage and more 5G investment.\n\nOokla\u2019s 5G map shows South Africa has raced ahead of everyone else in terms of commercially available 5G, with 16 deployments mostly by MTN. Kenya has three deployments but they are limited. Nigeria, on the other hand, hopes to catch up soon by tapping into its satellite infrastructure.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "title": "Successful product managers are walking encyclopedias.",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

          "title": "Samsung A12 Vs Infinix HOT 10T: Which Is A Better Buy?",
          "text": "Infinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A-game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colors that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inches. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of the display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equal higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed by the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk about the battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries apiece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google-sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version of android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords has now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternative solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Side-mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed to). It\u2019s a lot easier and more seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.",

          "title": "New FirstBank Website Puts YOU, the customer, First!",
          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be. Knowing that some potential customers do not live by its operating hours, FirstBank offers banking on their terms through the website.\n\nA standout feature of the new website is that it enables online applications and the ability to submit personal information securely. That makes it easy for interested visitors to open an account, offering a clear start to their banking journey.\n\nTools and Content that Empower Customers\n\nEvery user experience begins with a goal in mind and the new FirstBank website empowers its customers by providing a wide array of financial information and tools that meet customers needs, whatever they are. Among many actions, users can perform various transactions \u2013 make payments, transfer money, manage accounts, buy airtime, calculate loan rates and virtually interact with the bank \u2013 without stepping out of their comfort zone.\n\nThe site also serves as a library to keep customers abreast of various financial services solutions and offers intriguing content that is relevant to FirstBank\u2019s varied customer base \u2013 such as how-to guides that educate consumers on better managing their money and making the best financial decisions, thereby helping them to improve their economic and social wellbeing, as well as unique blog articles/insights on enterprise scaling, global trade and navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, targeted at corporate clients.\n\nLocation Finder\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the new FirstBank website is its Location Finder, where visitors can browse locations of the bank\u2019s branches and Firstmonie Agents. The feature allows users to search based on their radius or address and helps them find the FirstBank branch that\u2019s closest to them and best fits their needs. The branch locator is interactive and integrated with Google Maps API, which makes it easier for the visitor to browse the locations.\n\nOverall, FirstBank gets it right when it comes to usability, understanding its customers\u2019 needs and expectations, and website navigation behavior while creating a beautiful site that employs some of the latest trends in responsive web design, with exceptional user experience and a perfect mix of exciting features.\n\nWith the new FirstBank website, customers are at an edge in the industry as they establish a relationship with the Bank that puts YOU, its customers, First.\n\nYou can visit the new FirstBank website here.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nInfinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colours that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inch. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equals higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries a piece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords have now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternate solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear mounted finger print censor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side mounted fingerprint sensors. Side mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed with). It\u2019s a lot easier and seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nInfinix and Samsung are two major players in the African smartphone market. Both brands have managed to maintain their edge over other competitive brands through the consistent production of exceptional smartphones that meet the varying needs of gadget lovers within the space. Phones like the Infinix HOT 10 and the Samsung Galaxy A12 are one in the number of stellar products offered by both brands.\n\nBoth devices fall within the same range (the mid-range) and it might get a little tricky deciding which to pick if you walk into a store and are faced with both of them. We hope that we can give you a bit of clarity for your next shopping expedition through this comparison of the Infinix HOT 10T and Samsung Galaxy A12.\n\nIn terms of looks, we know that both brands always bring their A game. The two smartphones are designed with beautiful frames and colours that are easy on the eyes. If we were to judge by looks, you\u2019d definitely want to go home with both. But since we know that you\u2019d prefer to walk away with either one of the two devices, we\u2019d drill a little further.\n\nLet\u2019s start with something of interest to all our mobile game and Netflix lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisplay\n\nThis is an all-important feature for smartphone entertainment. Whether it\u2019s movie watching and game blasting, you want to be able to enjoy that from a big and sharp screen. To a large degree, both devices offer amazing displays. They both use a drop-notch screen that allows for a higher screen-to-body ratio and a better viewing experience. But here\u2019s where the difference starts to kick in.\n\nScreen size\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy A12 uses a 6.52-inch HD+ screen while the Infinix HOT 10 pushes its screen size up to 6.82 inch. The Infinix HOT 10\u2019s display is also high definition (just like Samsung\u2019s A12) but it\u2019s also specified that it has a 90Hz refresh rate. This translates to smoother images on the Infinix HOT 10T.\n\nResolution\n\nAnother metric with which users can determine the quality of display is the pixel count also known as resolution. Higher resolutions equals higher quality pictures. This explains why the 1080 movie on your laptop shows more detail than the 720p movie you downloaded from\u2026you know where.\n\nALSO READ: Infinix Launches All-New Hot 10T, The Ultimate Smartphone Entertainment Experience\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, here\u2019s the pixel count for both devices. The Samsung Galaxy A21 has a pixel count of 1600 x 720. On the other hand, the Infinix HOT 10\u2019s resolution equals 1640 x 720. Now here\u2019s where this could get a little tricky. Although Infinix has a higher resolution, Samsung fits 1600 x 720 pixels into a relatively smaller screen, while Infinix fits 1640 x 720 (a slightly higher amount of pixels) into a bigger screen. The result? Samsung is left with a higher pixel density which could very well contribute to better display quality.\n\nProcessing power\n\nHere both devices bring entirely different offerings to the table. Although both processors are designed the same company MediaTek, the devices use processors from different families under MediaTek. Samsung Galaxy A12 uses the MediaTek p35 processor while the Infinix HOT 10T uses the MediaTek G70 processor. Both processors are 8 core processors but according to a Nano review, here\u2019s what you get out of them.\n\nFrom the breakdown above, it seems like the MediaTek G70 rules flawlessly over the MediaTek P35. Overall CPU performance for multitasking is better, gaming performance is also better and to cap it all up, the MediaTek G70 works at a faster clock rate of 2.oGHzcompared to Samsung at 1.8GHz.\n\nBattery\n\nIn this next round, we talk battery capacity. Both brands seem to be fairly pitched against themselves with 5000mAh batteries a piece. However, the Samsung Galaxy A12 provides better charging ability with 15w fast charging technology against Infinix HOT 10\u2019s 10W charging technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperating system\n\nBoth devices run on the Google sponsored Android OS. However, Samsung uses an older version android 10. Well, it wasn\u2019t old until the 8th of September last year when Android 11 hit the market. Infinix HOT 10 on the other hand, runs on Android 11 the most recent version.\n\nFingerprint unlock\n\nOver the years, this has become another important smartphone feature. Using PINs and passwords have now been termed as taking the longer route. The only alternate solution to fingerprint unlock which has also gained attention is the facial unlock feature. However, it has been reported to be less secure in comparison with fingerprints.\n\nInfinix uses the common rear mounted finger print censor. Meaning its sensor is positioned at the back of the device and easily accessible with a touch from the pointer. However, Samsung uses a placement that I and a lot of other tech bros have come to enjoy better. Samsung A12 uses a side mounted fingerprint sensors. Side mounted fingerprint sensors are perfect because of how they\u2019re used to replace the power button (a button that we\u2019ve already become accustomed with). It\u2019s a lot easier and seamless.\n\nCamera\n\nSamsung is known to be a king in the area of smartphone photography. At the rear side of the Galaxy A12 Samsung uses a 48+5+2+2MP camera while the Infinix HOT 10 uses a 48+2+AI camera. Both cameras perform brilliantly under varying light conditions. However, the Infinix HOT 10 focuses on night life photography and performs exceptionally well in that regard. Using its Seper night mode and support from its QUAD led flash, Infinix brings more light into the beauty of the night life as contrasted below.\n\nSelfie comparison\n\nThe Infinix HOT 10T is available across all authorized retail stores nationwide at a retail price of 64800 while the Samsung A12 is sold at 67,200. Now that you have more information on what they offer, you can walk into any store and pick whichever one perfectly suits your need.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Egyptian agritech startup, Mozare3, has raised over $1 million in a pre-seed round. Algebra Ventures, Disruptech, and some angel investors like EFG-EV, participated in the round.\n\nMozare3 CEO, Hussein Abou Bakr, and his Co-founder, Tamer El-Raghy, founded the company in 2020 to assist more than 20 million smallholder farmers in Egypt by making markets and credits accessible to them.\n\nThe startup also plans to develop the first digital community for Egyptian farmers and offer them agronomy support through its professional network.\n\nThe agritech startup assists farmers sell their crops by working with institutional buyers like frozen vegetable processors, large retailers, and wholesalers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe farmers sign an offtake agreement \u2014 an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer\u2019s future goods \u2014 with Mozare3 to sell their produce at a particular price for institutional buyers.\n\nThis reduces the likelihood of the farmers not getting buyers after the harvest season. Most importantly, it encourages farmers to focus on their work without worrying about after-harvest sales.\n\nAccording to MENabytes, Abou Bakr said they currently have offtake agreements with 100 farmers and three large institutional buyers.\n\nAlthough most of Mozare3\u2019s work is done offline, a small group of farmers is currently beta testing its app.\n\nWith the app launch at the end of 2022, the company wants to reach over 10,000 farmers.\n\nIt would also allow farmers to access credit, receive agronomy support, buy fertilisers and other products to grow crops, and sell their products through its digital offtake agreements.\n\nAbou Bakr has over 20 years of experience in subsistence and commercial farming, food processing, and international trading. Before he founded Mozare3, he founded an agri processor and exporter, Plantform, that used to source produce from smallholders in over ten governorates in Egypt.\n\nThe CEO and the team hope to increase Mozare3\u2019s network to over 2,500 farmers with whom they have offtake agreements and increase its institutional buyers to over 37.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Egyptian agritech startup plans to introduce credit solutions to fund purchases of different products like motorbikes for the farmers and their families.\n\nEl-Raghy believes that Mozare3 would make supply more efficient by providing farmers with innovative financial products and turning them into contract farmers to fulfil consumers\u2019 growing demand, processors, and exporters.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, approximately 24 million people \u2014 over one-quarter of the population \u2014 work in Egypt\u2019s farming and fishing sectors. And being a major component of the economy, 6.5 million people depend on agriculture for survival.\n\nPerhaps Mozare3\u2019s plans to develop its tech, expand its team, and grow its network of farmers would help farmers and boost the economy as agriculture contributes 11.3% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: MENAbytes\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nNon progressive in Osun State are being intimidated by Aregbesola\u2019s rising profile. There have been several attacks on Aregbesola\u2019s birthday billboards from 2019 to date. Aregbesola is facing a big challenge to help the poorest people and ensure that everyone sees benefits from economic growth in Osun State as a result of the attacks. The attacks are calculated to smear the intimidating rising profile of Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nA billboard erected by the Caretaker Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun, Hon. Rasaq Salinsile, to congratulate the Minister of Interior and former Governor of the state, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola on his 64th birthday, was recently destroyed. The billboard was erected at the famous Old Garage area, Osogbo, The billboard was erected at the famous Old Garage area, Osogbo, the state capital. It was said to have been destroyed by some unknown persons at the early hours of Monday.\n\nIn March 2021 Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hired thugs. An elder brother to the Senator Representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Dr Ajibola Basiru, simply known as Simple, whose real name could not be confirmed as at the time of filing this report, was also attacked. Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hoodlums. This was a direct attack on Aregbesola and his rising profile in Osun State.\n\nAn elder brother to the Senator Representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Dr Ajibola Basiru, simply known as Simple, whose real name could not be confirmed as at the time of filing this report, was also attacked by the thugs who shot and unleashed machete cuts on their victims. The hoodlums, according to eye witnesses, came in an 18-seater bus led by two armed policemen.\n\nI gathered that the victims were attacked at a restaurant in Oroki Estate, Osogbo, around 10:30pm, where the lawmaker representing Osogbo Constituency at the State of Osun House of Assembly, Hon Taofeek Badmus was marking his birthday.\n\nThe Personal Assistant to the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon Timothy Owoeye, identified as Joseph Akanbi, was also attacked by the hoodlums.\n\nIn June, 2020 the billboard hosting the \u200bpicture and complimentary messages for Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior, Federal Republic of Nigeria was destroyed. The billboard, which was erected at Jaleyemi junction, Osogbo, State of Osun by a socio-political group, \u2018Jaleyemi For Good Governance\u2019 was allegedly destroyed. The billboard was allegedly destroyed by some unknown persons. According to the Chairman of the group, Rasidi Bello, the billboard on which Aregbesola\u2019s picture appeared was torn and taken away.\n\nBello, stated that while attempting to fix replace the billboard with a new one, two members of a group loyal to Hon. Lasun Yusuf, former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, approached and warned them not to hang the banner.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile we were attempting to fix the billboard and replace the banner with new Aregbesola\u2019s picture and complimentary words around 6PM, one Monsuru, popularly called Esu told us not to hang the banner. Another \u2018guy\u2019 known as Ibadi came to join him and also told us that we should not hang the banner. They said they wanted to hang IleriOluwa\u2019s banner on the billboard. The two of them are members of a group loyal to Hon Lasun Yusuf.\n\n\u201cLater, Nurudeen Adebayo, the leader of the group came and ordered his boys to attack us. They started throwing stones and broken bottles at us. We had to leave the place for them. They brought and spread out a big banner of IleriOluwa. \u2018Sponsored by Sola Oladepo\u2019 was written beneath the banner. Later, they uprooted the billboard and took it away.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Bello\u2019s claim, the Leader of the JaleyemiFor Good Governance, Idris Muftau, stated that members of the group had contributed to fix the billboard with a new banner on which \u2018Aregbesola: An Icon of Dynamism, the source and symbol of promotion of socio political excellence and good governance in the State of Osun\u2019 was written with picture.\n\nAccording to Muftau, the billboard was erected in 2016 and the group paid a sum of N16, 500 to the Osun Signage for them to host the new banner on it. He said the thugs that attacked them on Monday came back on Tuesday morning and threatened them not to dare erect any billboard at the spot again.\n\nMuftau said: \u201cWe were surprised that members of the Lasun Yusuf group could be telling us they wanted to host Ilerioluwa banner on our billboard without prior notice or due consultation. If anyone is going hang IleriOluwabanner in this place, it should be given to us. We worked for him and we are for him. It is absurd that two members of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) even joined the people that attacked us.\n\n\u201cOne of our members, Adetayo Adeleke was injured and rushed to the hospital. We reported the case at Oja Oba Police Station and the Divisional Police Officer led a team to the Jaleyemi junction to see the place the billboard was originally erected by us.\u201d\n\nInvestigations by the medium revealed that the said Lasun Yusuf group had dissolved into the APC and wanted to demonstrate their loyalty to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and as such, resorted to hang a banner for him.\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes fro Osogbo, Osun State\n\n...",

          "text": "*SEC to downsize workforce\n\nTom Okpe, Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives committee on finance has said that the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) should submit evidences of revenue remittances into Consolidated Federation Account from 2014 to 2019.\n\nThe lawmakers particularly asked the NNPC to furnish it with details of the revenue it calls \u2018Advance Consideration\u2019 which amounts to N2.725 billion in the 2018 and 2019 accounts of the corporation.\n\nAccording to the documents submitted to the committee which is investigating revenue remittances, NNPC received advanced consideration of N820.511 million from customers in 2018 and N1.904 billion in 2019.\n\nThe Committee also demanded for the Corporation\u2019s group account details and the appearance of all the Heads of NNPC subsidiaries and the Group Managing Director (GMD), Mele Kyari at a date to be fixed.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the Committee, Saidu Abdullahi expressed worry over the manner NNPC subsidiaries were operating in the country in terms of revenue remittances.\n\n\u201cAs a country, it is time we sit down as citizens and talk to ourselves, we have a responsibility of making this country work and to make it work is by doing what is right.\n\n\u201cWe have seen loopholes, we have seen leakages; we cannot over emphasize that the economy this country has the capacity to fund a N15 trillion budget; what we need to do is to ensure all agencies do what is right,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Group General Manager, Federation Account of NNPC, Bello Abdullahi said the Corporation has subsidiaries registered under Company And Allied Matters Act (CAMA) and pay taxes and other statutory obligations to the relevant authorities, but do not remit revenue to the Federation Account.\n\nAlso, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering todownsize its workforce to cut cost in the face of dwindling revenue.\n\nDirector General of SEC, Lamido Yuguda made this disclosure when he appeared before the House Committee on Finance, investigating Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) Revenue remittances into the Federation Account.\n\nYuguda, represented by SEC\u2019s Executive Commissioner for Corporate Services, Ibrahim Boyi said the Commission was determined to boost its revenue and reduce the cost of operation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, almost 80% of our cost is staff cost. So, we need to find a way of chopping off that cost and I think work is already going on. We are top heavy, almost 50% of our staff are from senior managers.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the mandate, I think we have taken as management and the board and I\u2019m sure in the matter of a few months, we\u2019ll be able to come with a solution but the idea really is to make the Commission more sustainable and make sure that our revenue is going forward.\u201d\n\nOn remittances to the Federation Account, Boyi said: \u201cWe have reconciled fully up to 2018 and, you know, in 2020 there was a new directive by the Federal Government that whether you are self funding agency or not, 25% of Revenue that hits your TSA will be deducted, which has been going on.\n\n\u201cWe are also going to factor that into our subsequent reconciliation with the office of the Accountant General. Unfortunately, for SEC in 2019, 2020 and this year, we\u2019re likely to end up with some deficits because of revenue shortage,\u201d he said.\n\nDeputy Chairman of the Committee, Saidu Abdullahi who represented the Chairman, James Faleke directed the Commission to reconcile its 2019 and 2020 Account with Office of the Accountant-General and explore ways of generating more revenue.\n\nAlso, the House on Tuesday furiously disagreed with the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), Ahmed Idris, over borrowings from assets recovery account by government agencies.\n\nReferences were made specifically to $23 million from the account which is yet to be refunded.\n\nAppearing before Ad-hoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots Movable and Immovable Assets from 2002 to 2020 by Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria for Effective Efficient Management and Utilisation, headed by Adejoro Adeogun, Idris was made to answer some questions.\n\nAdeogun pointed out that such instances abound, wondering if money can be taken from the coffers of the government without appropriation.\n\nHe said unless the Accountant General could provide evidence of the refund, it would be considered that such withdrawals were made illegally.\n\nThe committee would however, meet with the Accountant General on Thursday in a closed-door meeting to give a breakdown of such borrowings by government agencies and also to prove such monies have been refunded.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to draw attention to is that money is being borrowed out from the recovery account and not being refunded.\n\nUnless you are able to prove to us that it was refunded, we consider that to mean that payments have been made illegally,\u201d Adeogun said.\n\nThe committee chairman pointed that most of the projects for which these government agencies borrow such monies have already been appropriated for, in the budget.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami who earlier appeared before the committee said the National Assembly was slowing down effective management of recovered assets by the non passage of the Proceeds of Crimes Bill.\n\nThe Bill, he said, has put in place effective mechanisms, both in terms of database, disposal, processes and procedure to manage recovered assets.\n\nGiving a breakdown of recoveries made since 2017, he said, \u201cWe had succeeded in December 2017 to recover $322 million from Switzerland. Again in May 2020, we succeeded in recovering $311, 797, 866.11 from the Island of Jersey and indeed the UK.\n\nIn October 2020, we recovered 5, 494, 743.71 Euros from the Republic of Northern Ireland in Nigeria. And of recent we have succeeded in May 2021 in recovering \u00a34, 214, 017 from the UK known as Ibori loot.\u201d\n\nHe said all these are lodged with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Account on Assets Recovery, and receipts of amounts confirmed by the CBN",
          "summary": "The lawmakers particularly asked the NNPC to furnish it with details of the revenue it calls \u2018Advance Consideration\u2019 which amounts to N2.725 billion in the 2018 and 2019 accounts of the corporation.\nAccording to the documents submitted to the committee which is investigating revenue remittances, NNPC received advanced consideration of N820.511 million from customers in 2018 and N1.904 billion in 2019.\nDeputy Chairman of the Committee, Saidu Abdullahi expressed worry over the manner NNPC subsidiaries were operating in the country in terms of revenue remittances.\nAlso, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering todownsize its workforce to cut cost in the face of dwindling revenue.\nAgain in May 2020, we succeeded in recovering $311, 797, 866.11 from the Island of Jersey and indeed the UK.",

          "text": "By Doosuur Iwambe\n\nCivil society organisations (CSOs) in Nigeria have asked the federal government to compel Shell to clean up the massive pollution its extractive activities have created in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe CSOs cautioned that Shell\u2019s plan to move offshore is only targeted at evading the scrutiny that its onshore activities have attracted.\n\nThe coalition consists of three organisations, namely Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), and the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN).\n\nBen van Beurden, chief executive officer of Shell, had said that the company has struggled for years with spills in the Niger Delta because of pipeline theft and sabotage as well as operational issues.\n\nBeurden had remarked that Shell cannot solve community problems in the Niger Delta, added that, \u201cthat is for the Nigerian government perhaps to solve.\u201d\n\nIn January, a Dutch court ruled that Shell must pay for damages caused by oil spills in the Niger Delta area. Four farmers had sued the company for oil spills that they said caused widespread pollution of the land.\n\nThe CSOs expressed worry that the Nigerian government would be setting a wrong precedent if it allowed Shell to move offshore without addressing the grave environmental imprints its extraction has caused in the region.\n\nAccording to them, Shell is attracted to offshore extraction because oil companies pay less, and sometimes zero, royalties to Nigeria on wells in deeper waters, as well as to dodge responsibility for their \u201conshore mess.\u201d\n\nThey noted that it was time for Nigeria to diversify and transition from oil/gas, rather than allow Shell and her cohorts to set their eyes on more polluting activities offshore.\n\nNnimmo Bassey, director of HOMEF, insisted that Shell\u2019s operations have been a vicious cycle of reckless extraction, pollution and environmental degradation, utter disregard for the people, and brazen attempts to place the blame on the same people it has inflicted pains on.\n\n\u201cWe never expected less from a company that has ridden roughshod on the environment and people of the Niger Delta while raking in blood profits.\n\nFrom Ogoni to Ikarama to Ikot Ada Udo and Ejama-Ebubu, the footprints that Shell wants to run away from are open wounds that cannot be healed by evading responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Akinbode Oluwafemi, executive director of CAPPA, said it was the duty of the federal government to make Shell accountable for the environmental damage caused by spills and their impacts on communities in the Niger Delta region.\n\nIn his remark, Chima Williams, acting director of ERA/FoEN, said: \u201cIt is simply unacceptable and wishful thinking for Shell to even think it could escape liability from the mess it has created in the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe landmark ruling of the Dutch court against Shell in favour of the Niger Delta farmers in January 2021 and the UK court ruling in February affirming the rights of communities to sue even in European courts have opened vistas of opportunities that communities will exploit to hold Shell accountable.\n\n\u201cShell is going nowhere without cleaning up and paying up. The era of impunity is over.\u201d\n\nThe organisations urged communities to explore legal tools such as the liability roadmap launched in 2020, to hold Shell accountable.",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nAbidemi Rufai, the Nigerian accused of defrauding Washington\u2019s Employment Security Department in last year\u2019s unemployment fraud attack faces additional charge in the U.S.\n\nMyNorthwest.com reported on Tuesday that Rufai is also accused of submitting fraudulent claims for FEMA disaster relief, the IRS, and the Small Business Administration, going back to 2017.\n\nThe Nigerian politician from Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State is considered by investigators to be the first major player arrested in Washington\u2019s unemployment fraud attack, in which criminals are estimated to have stolen at least $650 million.\n\nNow Federal attorneys in the Western District of Washington are battling to block a bail granted to him last week by a Federal magistrate in New York.\n\nThe news platform said an appeal has been filed before a western district judge in Washington state.\n\nThe Western District judge has until June 4 to make a decision on that appeal, reports MyNorthwest.com\n\nLast week, a different judge in the Eastern District of New York had decided to release Abidemi Rufai on $300,000 bail, pending the decision on the appeal.\n\nRufai was to be released to the home of a family friend Nekpen Soyemi, a nurse with an address on Long Island. Until the appeal is decided, Rufai remains behind bars.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian was convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cWe do not think it\u2019s appropriate that someone who\u2019s been accused of wire fraud would be released into a home where \u2014 of the couple, the two people living there \u2014 the male part of the couple has already been convicted federally of wire fraud,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe explained that it is standard practice to keep someone released on bail away from former felons.\n\n\u201cGenerally, when someone is going to be released on bond, one of the conditions you often see is that they are not to associate with people who have criminal histories,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nThe appeal also noted that Rufai\u2019s named custodian was identified by her bank \u201cas a suspect in an email impersonation and money laundering scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Western District of Washington believes that he needs to come out here and face these charges in the district where they\u2019re filed,\u201d said Emily Langlie, communication director at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington.\n\nRufai\u2019s travel documents were seized, and his movements, if he is released on bond, will be monitored with an ankle bracelet. He would also be forbidden from leaving the Eastern District of New York \u2014 or eventually, the Western District of Washington.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian had been convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\nBesides the concern of guardianship, the appeal stated that Rufai is an extreme flight risk for several reasons.\n\nFor one, Rufai was already attempting to go back to Nigeria, and presumably would have done so had he not been detained; he was arrested at New York City\u2019s JFK International Airport on May 14 while attempting to board a flight back to Nigeria, by way of Amsterdam.\n\nThe appeal noted that Rufai has no clear ties to the Western District of Washington, and has just one family member living in the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Rufai\u2019s wife and children live in Nigeria, and he holds an appointed government position as senior special assistant to the governor of a Nigerian state. While he has been suspended from that position following his arrest, he has not been fired.\n\nAdditionally, Rufai allegedly has a history of forging identification documents, and prosecutors worry he could easily obtain a false passport. They noted that at the time of his arrest he held a first-class plane ticket and several other items of luxury, suggesting that he has the financial means of getting away.\n\n\u201cRufai is experienced in obtaining and trafficking in stolen identities and identification documents. He has the skills and resources to produce fraudulent documents that would allow him to leave the country,\u201d the attorneys wrote, adding, \u201cLocation monitoring will not guarantee Rufai\u2019s appearance. A defendant determined to flee can simply remove his location monitoring device and disappear.\u201d\n\nProsecutors believe that Rufai would be gone for good if he did get back to Nigeria, noting that it is hard enough to extradite ordinary Nigerian citizens, much less high-power government members.\n\n\u201cExtradition would be difficult \u2014 in part because he is a government official there,\u201d Langlie told KIRO Radio last week.\n\nIf prosecutors get their way, Rufai will be transported to Seattle \u2014 though he could still be let out on bail once in Washington.\n\n\u201cRather than have him released in New York, it\u2019s our preference that the U.S. Marshals Service transport him to the Western District of Washington, and then he can have another bail release hearing here,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe did not have a timeline on when that could happen, noting that, for security reasons, they don\u2019t tend to find out ahead of time when a person is being transported by the Marshals.\n\nWhatever the judge decides on the appeal, that decision could further be appealed by either side before it is considered final.",

          "text": "By Abankula with agency reports\n\nMali\u2019s interim vice president Colonel Assimi Goita said on Tuesday he had seized power as a fresh coup within an older coup unravelled in the country.\n\nGoita was one of the coup plotters that toppled the elected government of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita last August.\n\nHe said he took over power because President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane failed to consult him about a cabinet reshuffle, which dropped two former coup leaders.\n\nBoth leaders have been detained at a military base outside the capital Bamako since Monday evening.\n\nThe two men were in charge of a transitional government created after a military takeover in August that ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. They were tasked with overseeing a return to democratic elections next year.\n\nIn a statement read by an aide on national television, Goita said elections next year to restore an elected government would go ahead as planned.\n\n\u201cThe vice president of the transition saw himself obligated to act to preserve the transitional charter and defend the republic,\u201d the statement said.\n\nInternational pressure increased on Goita and the junta on Tuesday, demanding the release of Ndaw and Ouane.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron condemned what he said was a \u201ccoup within a coup\u201d and raised the threat of targeted sanctions.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council is due to privately discuss the latest developments in Mali on Wednesday, diplomats said.\n\nFrance, a former colonial power and military ally to Mali, joined the United States, the European Union and others in condemning the detention and called for their immediate release.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to take in the coming hours targeted sanctions against those taking part,\u201d Macron told reporters at the end of an EU summit.\n\nWorried about the fallout from Monday\u2019s detentions, the United Nations, European Union, United States and regional countries have all demanded the release of the leaders.\n\n\u201cSanctions will be adopted against those who stand in the way of the transition,\u201d Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, said on Twitter.\n\nA delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) arrived in Mali on Monday to help resolve the dispute.\n\nECOWAS played a key role in the formation of the interim government after the August coup.\n\nThe situation could exacerbate instability in the West African country, where Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State control large areas of the north and centre and stage frequent attacks on the army and civilians.\n\nPolitical instability and military infighting have complicated efforts by Western powers and neighbouring countries to help Mali, and jihadists have been able to use the country as a launchpad for attacks across the region.\n\nMali has been in turmoil since 2012 when the army, frustrated over the government\u2019s handling of a rebellion, ousted president Amadou Toumani Toure. Separatist and Islamist rebels took advantage and seized the north of the country.\n\nFrench forces drove back the Islamists in 2013 but they have regrouped and expanded their reach to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nThe problems in Mali are part of a recent democratic backslide in West and Central Africa, where strong military factions have taken control or presidents have extended their rule beyond their allotted mandates.\n\nLast month a military council seized power in Chad after the battlefield death of president Idriss Deby.\n\nHis son, Mahamat Idriss Deby, now runs the country and has promised a transition to civilian rule similar to Mali\u2019s.\n\nThe opposition and civil society say the military holds too much power and fear Deby will not relinquish control.\n\nAssimi Goita\u2019s coup statement:\n\nCommander Baba Ciss\u00e9, special advisor to the vice-president of the Transition, Assimi Go\u00efta, read a statement on Tuesday, May 25, on national television.\n\n\n\n\u201cFollowing a crisis lasting several months at the national level taking into account strikes and various demonstrations by social and political actors, the government led by Mr. Moctar Ouane, has shown itself incapable of constituting a reliable interlocutor, likely to mobilize the confidence of social partners.\n\nIn the process and unilaterally, the president of the transition accepted the resignation of the government and immediately renews the prime minister with the mandate to go to the formation of a new government. The consequence has been a general consternation marked by the persistence of strikes by the National Union of Workers of Mali (UNTM), the outcome of which is ultimately an indefinite strike. This state of affairs constitutes a real asphyxiation of the Malian economy and hence the guarantee of instability with immeasurable consequences.\n\nIn the process of constituting a new government, the newly appointed Prime Minister established a list of government in agreement with the President of the Transition without consultation with the vice-president in charge of the prerogatives conferred on him by the charter, namely, the Defense and Security. Such an approach testifies to a clear will of the President of the Transition and of the Prime Minister to move towards a violation of the Transition Charter, contrary to the oath taken during his inauguration on September 25, 2020. Notwithstanding the various arrests and negotiations undertaken by the Vice-President to the Heads of State of the sub-region and to certain chancelleries present in Mali in order to bring the President of the Transition and the Prime Minister to respect the requirements of the Transition Charter,\n\nThus, by the oath taken at the same time as the president of the transition and held by the patriotic commitment taken before the Malian people as well as before the defense and security forces, the vice-president of the transition seen in the obligation to act to preserve the transitional charter and defend the republic prerogatives the President and his Prime Minister as well as all the people implied in the situation.\n\nIn this circumstance, the vice-president of the Transition invites the populations to go about their business freely and reassures them of the unwavering commitment of the Armed Forces of Defense and Security, to preserve the best interests of the Malian people, in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Transition Charter. Moreover, the vice-president of the Transition would like to point out that the Transition process is following its normal course and that the elections scheduled will be held during 2022 \u201d.",
          "summary": "By Abankula with agency reportsMali\u2019s interim vice president Colonel Assimi Goita said on Tuesday he had seized power as a fresh coup within an older coup unravelled in the country.\nGoita was one of the coup plotters that toppled the elected government of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita last August.\nHe said he took over power because President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane failed to consult him about a cabinet reshuffle, which dropped two former coup leaders.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron condemned what he said was a \u201ccoup within a coup\u201d and raised the threat of targeted sanctions.\nLast month a military council seized power in Chad after the battlefield death of president Idriss Deby.",

          "title": "OPEN GRAZING: We\u2019ll no longer tolerate attacks on herders, NEF warns",
          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has lamented alleged killing and attacks on northerners living in the south and other parts of the country.\n\nIt also said the forum will no longer fold its hands and allow the \u201cunprovoked killings\u201d to continue, especially with the issue of open grazing and ranching being considered by different governments.\n\nThe group made the position known in a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja Tuesday and signed by NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nThe forum said many state governors were to blame for allowing attacks on helpless herders in their states, even as it said it was open to dialogue in ending insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum (NEF) is convinced that it is time to respond to issues that threaten our collective security and the unity and integrity of the country. The Forum has held back on joining issues with persons and groups intent on provoking the type of crises that will escalate beyond control or mitigation by leaders, who are collectively showing definite signs that they are unwilling to steer the country away from the dangerous threats which are crippling it.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that elected people sworn to protect the constitution and protect the unity and integrity of Nigeria have decided to surrender to deeply divisive or out rightly irredentist and secessionist tendencies and movements. In the South East, governors are yielding their political turf and mandates to secessionists, criminals and subversives, who think they can exterminate federal presence and northerners from the region and achieve dubious political goals related to 2023 or break away from the country.\n\n\u201cIn the South-west, elected leaders and pampered ethnic bullies are closing ranks to provide a front that apes the do-what-we-want-or-we-leave-the-country strategy of the marginalised leaders of the South East. Governors are building ethnic monsters and hiding behind them to whip up sentiments in a crude attempt to extract concessions no one is in a position to give or guarantee.\n\n\u201cThe South-south is squeezed between fear and uncertainty and its leaders are gambling that they can benefit from further weakening the federal administration and the North if it rides along with the rest of the South.\n\n\u201cA plastic unity is being contrived to create the impression that the entire South is united behind shared grievances against the Presidency and Fulani herders and all northerners, who are cast as fair game in responding to all of President Buhari\u2019s multiple failures. A desperate, but futile attempt is being made to split the North along lines that suit people who ignore its complexities and plurality when it is convenient to lump all Northerners and submit them to humiliation or attacks.\n\n\u201cThe NEF recognises that most of these provocations feed from the widespread perception of a weak national leadership and a broken political process that has become captive of narrow political interests. For the record, the forum restates its support for a programmed transition that will eliminate open grazing and the establishment of productive, safe and sustainable options in managing our huge national asset in animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be achieved with threats and harassment, but with commitment and collaboration involving all governments and stakeholders. It is in everyone\u2019s interests to support an urgent national initiative that will engineer a safe and productive transition to the end of open grazing. In the meantime, the forum must warn those attacking and killing Fulani herders to stop. There are limits to every community\u2019s tolerance, and the forum strongly advises that lines are respected in the manner we treat Nigerians, who are vulnerable wherever they live.\u201d\n\nThe elders added: \u201cThe forum has always supported initiatives that improve the quality of inputs into how Nigerians can address the limitations in the manner the country is operated. It is unfortunate that the current efforts of the National Assembly to amend the constitution enjoys little or no confidence among Nigerians that they will address the fundamental challenges which need to be comprehensively addressed, although this can be redressed if our elected representatives recognize the historic opportunities they have to move this country beyond its strangulating challenges.\n\n\u201cThe negative attitude of the Presidency towards engaging Nigerians to tap into ideas, grievances and goodwill of many citizens who mean well is ill-informed and, under our current circumstances, dangerous. So are postures that issue opportunistic ultimatums over convening national dialogue by the President. The forum supports a citizen-driven national dialogue and a campaign to get the government to accord its outcome the respect it deserves. The forum extends its hands to groups that genuinely believe that Nigerians should demand and design the type of country we want, and should not wait for people we elected to set the boundaries and conditions of our existence.\n\n\u201cThe forum restates that the North will not be cowed and stampeded into escorting political ambitions of politicians at the cost of its rights, security and dignity. It demands that President Buhari asserts the powers our constitution gives him to protect our territorial integrity and secure citizens, or accept that he is incapable of leading the nation through these unprecedented challenges.\n\n\u201cAttacks on lawful Fulani and other Northerners in the South must stop and those who have killed them must be brought to book. The nation needs to know that Northerners in many parts of the South now live in heightened fear as they are profiled and harassed by elements in host communities, who believe that there are no consequences for their actions.\n\n\u201cThe forum demands an end to attacks on federal agents and facilities. Governors in the South must be unambiguous in their condemnation and resistance against these dangerous activities. They cannot continue to walk on both sides of the street. Northern governors should note that they are rapidly receding into irrelevance as desperate citizens\u2019 chalk up their silence over multiple assaults in a country where they have equal rights to their security and dignity.\n\n\u201cIf our country is to survive its current difficulties and build a better nation, President Buhari must improve his levels of competence, awareness that the nation is sliding into disaster and sensitivity to the frustrations of Nigerians. Other political leaders, who take advantage of the limitations of the President to light fires, should know that they will get burnt in them.\n\n\u201cOverwhelming majority of Nigerians do not want war or an end to our union. We just want an end to insecurity, escalating cost of living and the hate and the fear which our leaders are triggering. The forum restates its readiness to engage any group of Nigerians in exploring productive paths to a better future. What it will not do is to watch as the North is damaged further by cynical southern politicians and adventurers who think the North is too weak to protect its own interests.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Tuesday accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of being behind the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in various parts of the country.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan made the position known in a statement issued in Abuja.\n\nHe restated the party\u2019s position that the APC has \u201cbeen promoting acts of violence including burning of INEC offices in other to build up an emergency situation and frustrate the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt is despicable that having realised that it has no place in the 2023 election, given its abysmal failure in governance, APC leaders are seeking to set our country ablaze and truncate our hard-earned democracy.\u201d\n\nPDP urged Nigerians to \u201cnote the failure of the APC and its leaders to forcefully condemn this clear assault on our frontline institution of democracy. This is also as the APC administration has failed to take decisive steps to protect INEC facilities from assailants.\n\n\u201cOur party wants the APC to know that May 29, 2023 date is sacrosanct for it to leave office, free our nation from its stranglehold and fizzle out from our political firmament.\n\n\u201cIndeed, history will not be kind to APC and its leaders given the magnitude of atrocities they have committed against Nigerians in a space of six years.\n\n\u201cThe APC has destroyed our nation, opened our dear fatherland to bandits and terrorists, turned our nation into an expansive killing field and a large funeral palour.\n\n\u201cAPC has wrecked our economy, opened our national vaults to its leaders to pillage over N15 trillion and reduced our once thriving country to a beggar nation while mortgaging our future with humongous foreign debts.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on the Inspector General of Police to immediately invite and question APC leaders over the burning of INEC offices.\n\n\u201cNigerians also expect the police to immediately place APC leaders and their thugs on watch list as a firm step to guarantee the security of INEC facilities and other institutions of democracy in the country.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also calls on Nigerians, across board, to remain at alert and unite in prayers so that our nation survives the next two years under the vindictive, insensitive, incompetent, treasury looting, divisive and violent APC and its administration,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nAPC responds\n\nAnd in a swift response, the governing APC said the opposition PDP was behind the consistent attacks on the INEC facilities.\n\nIn a statement signed Tuesday evening in Abuja by the national secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the party likened PDP\u2019s statement to the Biblical judgement of King Solomon in the case of the two women claiming to be the rightful mother of a child.\n\nThe party said: \u201cUsing lies and sponsored media attacks on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government, the PDP has inadvertently shown its hands as sponsors behind the politically-motivated attacks on some of our public and democratic institutions in the country, all in a clearly desperate bid to destabilise this government.\n\n\u201cUntil now, the APC had deliberately refrained from commenting on the obviously sponsored attacks on INEC facilities in order not to pre-empt the efforts of our security services to unravel the sponsors. The truth is now in the open and our security services should act fast and decisively against these enemies of democracy and haters of a legitimately elected government.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the PDP thinks Nigerians have forgotten its long and documented penchant of eroding and destroying democratic institutions. To name one, was it not the same PDP that attempted to discredit INEC and the entire 2019 election with a bogus tale of a server that never existed and employed hackers to disrupt the communication network of the electoral body during 2019 election?\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe further said the APC cannot be at home and burn its house.\n\n\u201cA winner cannot destroy the process that brought it to success. From the 2015 to 2019 elections, Nigerians spoke clearly through their votes for the APC by mandating us to rescue the country from the PDPs 16-year misadventure. The PDP should address itself to the reality that it stands rejected by the electorates. Its undemocratic plan is ill-fated and will fail woefully.\n\n\u201cIn other respected democratic climes, criminalities and governance are differentiated. There is no attempt to politicise, sponsor and weaponise insecurity as the PDP is relentlessly doing. We call on Nigerians to completely reject and resist the PDP antics and actions. They do not mean well for this country,\u201d the ruling party also added.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

It produces value for all of us by providing a clear line of sight for investment in the Bonga bloc of around $10billion,\u201d Mallam Kyari stated.\n\nHe disclosed that the deal would yield over $780million in immediate revenues to the federal government while it would also free the parties from over $9billion in contingent liabilities.\n\n\u201cUltimately, these agreements will engender growth in our country where investment will come in for other assets, not just in the deep-water, but even for new investors. It is an opportunity for them to see that this country is ready for business,\u201d the GMD enthused.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timpre Sylva, and the NNPC Board of Directors for enabling the Corporation to achieve this laudable landmark.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Country Chair of Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Osagie Osunbor, said the OML 118 renewal agreement would remain a watershed in the history of deep-water investments in Nigeria, assuring that the giant stride would further bolster investor confidence in the country.\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Managing Director of SNEPCo, Mr. Bayo Ojulari, noted that the agreements marked the end of a twelve-year dispute that had marred business relationships and affected trust and investment.\n\n\u201cToday, we have signed agreements that define the future of deep-water for Nigeria. This is the first deep-water block that was developed in Nigeria and it is also the first one that we are resolving all the disputes that will lay the foundation for the resolution of other PSCs,\u201d the SNEPCo helmsman stated.\n\nOn their parts, the Managing Directors of Total, Mike Sangster, Exxonmobil, Richard Laing and NAOC, Roberto Danielle, all applauded the GMD NNPC, Mallam Kyari, for providing leadership which engendered the resolution of the disputes, assuring that the agreements would attract more investments into the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Tuesday said the Federal Government\u2019s insistence on open grazing suggests it has a hidden agenda.\n\nThe Presidency had on Monday faulted the recent resolutions of the Southern Governors, including the ban on open grazing in the entire southern part of the country.\n\nA statement signed by Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said the Governors\u2019 resolutions failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nInstead, the statement added, President Buhari has \u201ccommissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the States, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\u201d\n\nBut the Benue State Governor, in a statement signed by spokesman Terver Akase, said the insistence on open grazing reserves was curious.\n\n\u201cWe find the move not only shocking and curious but also as a misplaced priority,\u201d the Ortom statement said.\n\n\u201cAt a time the country is worried about the worsening security situation and many Nigerians are calling for national dialogue to address the fundamental issues that have led to the present state of affairs, the Federal Government considers the reopening of cattle grazing routes as the only solution available to it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Open Grazing Ban: Southern Governors Did Not Provide Any Solution \u2013 Presidency\n\nThe Governor faulted the Federal Government\u2019s plan to commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\nOrtom recalled that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had met on February 9 and agreed that the current system of herding mainly by open grazing is no longer sustainable, in view of the growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nWhile noting that the Forum consequently resolved to sensitize herders on the need to adopt ranching as the new method of animal husbandry, Ortom said the 17 Governors of Southern Nigeria also met on May 11 in Asaba and banned open grazing in the entire region.\n\nThe Southern Governors, the Benue leader added, adopted ranching as the alternative method of rearing animals.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs it stands, the Presidency is the lone hand pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of 1950s and 60s. The Presidency has, by its endorsement of open grazing, emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all lands in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original owners of such lands.\n\n\u201cThe fact must be established that grazing reserves or cattle routes are no longer tenable in the 21st century when Nigeria\u2019s population far exceeds that of the fifties at a time these routes were contemplated.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities. The country\u2019s land mass has also reduced to less than 923 square kilometers with the excision of Bakassi to Cameroon. Besides, the international best practice of animal husbandry is ranching; and that\u2019s the stand of Benue State.\u201d",

Some recoveries are for state governments, and when they come, we will send them to the state governments, including the Ibori loot.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of the Ibori loot was paid to Delta state. The states will not allow their monies to be taken; they will take us to court, and we don\u2019t joke with that.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
