          "title": "Soot: Wike declares war on cartel illegally refining oil",
          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has vowed not to spare anyone involved in illegal bunkering and artisanal refinery activities that have caused a soot pandemic in the state.\n\nWike said his administration would not succumb to any form of blackmail or sentiment that would be stirred by the perpetrators in an attempt to frustrate efforts at curbing the hazardous business.\n\nThe governor made the vow when he made a long walk through track roads into the forest of the Ogbodo community in the Ikwerre Local Government Area and the forest of the Ibaa community in the Emohua Local Government Area of the state to uncover some illegal crude oil refining sites.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by the governor\u2019s media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, which was made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt.\n\nWike was quoted as saying, \u201cThey can\u2019t be doing this and killing my people. No reasonable government will allow that. And I can tell you with all due respect that we will take this matter very seriously.\n\n\u201cLook at how everyday in your house, you see soot. I mean, how can you allow that? So, this one that we can solve, we will solve it.\n\n\u201cWe have assured the people of Rivers State that we will fight this matter to the last until I leave office.\u201d\n\nHe noted that confronting the cartel behind the business would not be easy, but vowed to consider it as a war like situation and fight it from the standpoint of the law.\n\nAccording to him, no matter how highly placed the perpetrators may be, they will not be spared, but will be confronted, apprehended and made to face the full force of the law.\n\nWike directed the Attorney-General of the state and Commissioner for Justice, Prof Zacchaeus Adangor, SAN, to take over the case files of illegal crude oil refinery operators arrested by the police.\n\nHe added, \u201cAttorney-general, all these matters with the police, you have to retrieve the files so that you can prosecute the matters on your own. I don\u2019t want any compromise anywhere.\n\n\u201cIt will not be on the ministry. You have to constitute a legal team. Go and get our friends all over the country so that we can execute this prosecution to the last.\n\n\u201cIt is a serious matter. And I\u2019m going to take it head on. In fact, it is a war. It is not poor people doing this, they\u2019re a cartel. You must go and arrest these people; Chief W. J. Wocha, you must arrest Fubara Ohaka, and Chief Promise Ezekwe. You must arrest them.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how highly placed you are. If you like, be the paramount ruler. In fact, any traditional ruler that is involved, pick him for me. Let him understand that the law does not respect anybody.\u201d\n\nThe governor directed the Chairman of the Emohua Local Government Area, Dr Chidi Lloyd, to locate residences where processed crude oil products were being stored and ascertain their sources.\n\nWike said the purpose of confronting the menace was to ensure that the health of Rivers people was not further hampered by illegal refining activities.\n\nHe added, \u201cI have said to the Federal Government, if you\u2019re not willing to do anything, don\u2019t promise people anything. You told them that you will do something, how can you promise modular refineries?\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about is the safety of Rivers people. That is more important to me.\u201d\n\nLloyd noted that the problem of illegal refining activities in the area was beyond the capacity of the council to handle.\n\nHe wondered why the Federal Government, which once promised to establish modular refineries in the Niger Delta region, had reneged on the promise.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The planned arraignment of the traditional ruler of Oko in Oyo State, Oba Solomon Akinola, on charges of terrorism could not take place on Thursday at a Federal High Court in Abuja due to objection to the jurisdiction of the court to conduct the trial.\n\nAlthough the monarch was not physically present to take his plea, three of his high chiefs, Sunday Aderinto, 87; Samson Ogunmola, 76; and Timothy Aderinto, 71, were brought to the court under heavy police security.\n\nShortly after the three chiefs were called to the dock, their counsel, Jimoh Abdulsalam, raised objection to the taking of their plea for the offences allegedly committed between May 10 and 21, 2021.\n\nHe premised his objection on the validity of the charges, insisting that the three chiefs were victims of a land dispute between Oko and Aagba communities near Ogbomoso in the Surulere Local Government Area of Oyo State.\n\nWhile informing the court that it was only the Attorney-General of the Federation that could handle terrorism charges, he expressed displeasure that the police coloured a communal land dispute as terrorism act, adding that the chiefs could not take plea on terrorism charges.\n\nThe lawyer also challenged the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit, adding that the defendants, who had spent 37 days in police custody, were not brought properly before the court.\n\nThe problem was compounded by the inability of the prosecution to counter the oral objection of the defendants with any authority of the law.\n\nFollowing the objection to the arraignment, Justice Obiora Egwuatu directed the defence counsel to put his objection in writing and serve the same on the prosecution.\n\nOther chiefs billed for arraignment but said to be at large are Jimoh Asimiyu, Segun Gbadebo, Oluwole Ogundeji, Akintaro Piamo, Rafiu Ganiyu, Adejare Adeleru and Zaccheus Adeleru.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police had filed the terrorism charges against them through an officer in the Legal Department of the Force Headquarters, Orji Kalu.\n\nThe criminal charges, among others, alleged that the defendants, while armed with weapons such as cutlasses and knives, allegedly conspired and invaded the Aagba community and kidnapped three persons in addition to inflicting varying degrees of injury on their victims.\n\nThose said to have been kidnapped are Atanda Akinwale, Olayiwola Gbadebo and Olusola Agbebi.\n\nThe offences, according to the prosecution, contravene Section 1 (2) of the Terrorism Prevention Act, 2013.\n\nThey were also accused of inflicting injuries on Muritala Alimi, Omilabu Oluwasegun and Mrs Rachel Bamidele.\n\nThe charges also indicated that four tyres of the Honda Pilot SUV belonging to the Baale of Aagba, Chief Adesola Ajiboye, a motorcycle worth N300,000, a borehole, vehicle windscreen, pipes, a bulldozer and a farm were destroyed.\n\nThe defendants were further accused of stealing 15 bags of cement worth N450,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Egwuatu has February 14 to take the objection of the defendants to the charges.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Benue State Ministry of Health and Human Services has slammed Prof. Terhemba Shija, for politicizing the death of Samuel Tagher.\n\nTagher, a medical doctor, died a few days ago of Lassa fever in Makurdi, the Benue State capital.\n\nThe deceased doctor, who was a staff of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Benue State, is said to have taken ill and was referred to Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo State, where he later died.\n\nFollowing his death, Prof. Shija, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, had in an entitled: \u2018The Land That Devours Its Own; A Dirge For All Fallen Heroes in Benue State,\u2019 Prof Shija, accused the Benue State University Teaching Hospital, BSUTH, Ministry of Health and the State Government of being responsible for the death of Dr Tagher.\n\nReacting, the state\u2019s ministry of health expressed disappointment with Shija\u2019s comment on the death of the young man.\n\nA statement signed by Haanya Aondoakura, the Media Assistant to the Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Joseph Ngbea, described Shija\u2019s article as \u201ca blatant resort to murdering facts and politicizing deaths.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads below:\n\n\u201cA few days ago, the medical profession in Benue State lost one of its budding and hard-working members, Dr. Samuel Tagher, to Lassa Fever. As colleagues, friends and family of the fallen hero mourn and brace up to face the reality of his untimely death, a renowned academic and politician in the state, Prof. Terhemba Shija, rather chose to use this unfortunate incident to play politics with his death.\n\n\u201cInasmuch as we wouldn\u2019t want to join issues with the professor, who should ordinarily be a statesman without political bias in such times, he chose to do otherwise.\n\n\u201cIn his bid to be governor of Benue State in 2023 at all costs, he decided to employ dirty political strategies to endear himself to the people. To this end, we wish to put the facts straight, especially as it regards how Dr Tagher was managed at the Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi, before he was transferred to another hospital.\n\n\u201cDr Tagher was brought to the facility on January 5, 2022 and due to the symptoms he showed and the test ordered for, a working diagnosis of malaria fever was made and treatment commenced immediately. His condition was stabilized and a discharge was considered. But the consultants managing his case decided to put him on further observation.\n\n\u201cIt was while he was being observed that he showed further symptoms, which became suggestive of Lassa Fever and more tests were ordered which returned positive for Lassa on 6th January 2022. He was immediately moved to an isolation centre and treatment for Lassa commenced.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that he was referred to Irua Specialist Hospital, Edo State for further management. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t come out and we lost him. Summarily, this was exactly what transpired and how his professional colleagues in the State attempted to save him.\n\n\u201cBefore one is qualified to practice as a Medical doctor, he goes through a series of ethical procedures as well as oaths to uphold the sanctity of life. In the case of Dr Tagher, we did our best for him in line with the demands on us. It is only unfortunate that he would go the way of all men at this time.\n\n\u201cProfessor Shija is not a medical doctor, but common sense expects that he should know all these and uphold them in spite of his desperate political campaign\u2019s pressure. A blatant resort to murdering facts and politicizing deaths, to a large extant, would make our Professor look little than he should appear to the public.\n\n\u201cWe use this opportunity to sympathize with the family of Dr Samuel Tagher and wish them well at this trying time and may his soul rest in peace.\u201d",

They undertook their residential projects in various locations, including engaging in wildlife conservation at the National Children\u2019s Park here in Abuja. Athletics trainings, I\u2019m told, at sports camps, leadership training at various youth, events, volunteering at various orphanages and hospitals.\n\n\u201cA recipient, Faith Iwuh, wins gold for her residential project, volunteered at the Renaissance Hospital in Enugu State, and I think we\u2019ve heard about that, having observed that the hospital was experiencing a shortage of staff, she resided in the hospital for a month, volunteering as a health worker, and support staff to the hospital.\n\n\u201cMeeting you all today is a reminder of the many achievements of young people across Nigeria. Daily, we have Nigerians in our armed forces, leaving behind family and friends to serve our country in various internal security operations. We have seen how young Nigerians rallied in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and designed various technology solutions to support the government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen young Nigerians break new ground and earn global acclaim in innovation, in technology, in sports and the arts and entertainment. So, it\u2019s clear to us that our young people are our most valuable assets and the Federal Government believes that they must be encouraged and supported in every way, which is why we\u2019re currently raising about $500 million to support technology and creativity.\n\n\u201cThe project is led by the African Development Bank, which has already committed $170 million to the enterprise and this will be supported by the Federal Government, Islamic Development Bank and the French Development Agency.\n\n\u201cLast year, Mr. President launched the Nigeria Jubilee Fellowship Programme. This is a programme supported by the UNDP and the European Union and private sector and many people in the private sector. It will run for five years and it will give well paid work experience opportunities to 20,000 young Nigerians every year in select private sector and public sector organisations.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that these interns will gain relevant career and life skills that will enable them to transition seamlessly into the professional, business or public sector, while also earning good pay during the period of their internship. I hope that many of you that, our gold award winners, will participate in that program and will be a part of that program and experience all of the benefits of the program\u201d, he said.\n\nIAYP Board of Trustee Chairman Edun, explained the process of participating in the programme, which he said, had produced 44 young Nigerians who have reached the apex of a long race to the peak.\n\nThe said the programme had produced more than million young participants globally, mentored through the process by more than 200,000 adults\n\n\u201cWhat we have just witnessed with the in the presence of His Excellency, the vice president of the Federal Republic, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, is the Gold Award Ceremony, where the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Gold Award was conferred on 44 youngsters who have achieved that level in this programme, which is of full curricular, non-formal, out of the classroom education. It\u2019s a worldwide platform and brand and it just empowers youngsters.\n\n\u201cAlongside their formal education, it gives them the skills and confidence to go out into the world and to increase their employability, their chances of success in the world. So, it is very gratifying and very encouraging for the youngsters that no less a personality than His Excellency, the Vice President, was there to recognize their achievements and confer upon them the award itself.\n\n\u201cThe award itself was founded by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, who as we all know, was the husband of the Queen of England and since then, over a million youngsters worldwide have participated in the event. In addition to the youngsters, there are the adults. In order to put young people through this program, and not only ensure that they benefit from it, but they have the opportunity to have fun, to have adventure and to enjoy themselves as young people, you need adults and about 200,000 adults have mentored them through this award.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the whole society, the young people, but also the adults, the financial supporters, for those who can\u2019t afford for their parents to pay for them to go through the world, we have corporate sponsors, you have individual Nigerians and people generally supporting the ability of young people to go through this unique program\u201d, he explained.\n\nAsked if there is any mechanism of monitoring the progress of participants, Edun added: \u201cThey are mentored through it and they have to meet standards. Before you can get to gold, you have met the highest of standards. So yes, the whole initiative has clear standards and objective measurements that are set and it\u2019s only those that achieved that high standard that achieve the gold award and they are measured and benchmarked, not just in Nigeria, but internationally\u201d, he said.\n\nThe event, which drew attendance from graduands, their parents and teachers, former participants and others, was graced by British Deputy High Commissioner, Jill Atkinson.",

You have represented our Party very well.\u201d\n\nOn the Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road upgrade into a modern expressway, the President noted that it would complement the Sagamu-Benin Expressway being reconstructed by the Federal Government.\n\nHe assured that the Sagamu-Benin Expressway and the Lagos-Ibadan Highway would be completed and inaugurated this year.\n\nThe President said: \u201cJust across the road is the 42-kilometer Sagamu-Interchange-Abeokuta Road, which the state government has reconstructed and equipped with street lights.\n\n\u2018\u201cThat road enjoys a direct linkage with the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway that the Federal Government is rebuilding and due for completion later this year.\n\n\u201cI am particularly impressed by the quality and standard of your road projects, and the creative way you have deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them.\n\n\u201cIt is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the states and Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThese roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital, to Kano, with Ogun State having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u201d\n\nOn the housing schemes, Buhari described it as heart-warming that it cuts across different social strata, capturing the low, medium and high income earners.\n\nAdmiring the Gateway City Gate Monument, Buhari said: \u201cIt is not just a Park beautification project, it depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State, a welcoming entrance into the state capital at the centre of the state.\u201d\n\nHe described the project as an icon depicting the joining of hands for building the future of Ogun State in togetherness.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, well done! I am proud of what you have done for your state and your people. You have made our great party, the APC, proud too. \u201c\n\nResponding to requests by governor for the prioritisation of the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko roads, the President assured that the roads will get federal attention.\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of the two critical roads as done for the 100-kilometed Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road.\n\nHe also hinted that approval might be considered for the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo Road by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the tax credit scheme.\n\nThanking residents for the warm reception accorded him on his first visit to any state in the New Year, he said: \u201cThis welcome by the large crowd brings back the nostalgia of my first arrival on this soil as a young infantry officer in the Nigerian Army at the then Lafenwa Barracks in Abeokuta, not long after independence.\n\n\u201cThe traditional hospitality of the people of this State has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u2018Omowale\u2019 and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters whose goodwill I have always enjoyed. Thank you.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President congratulated the people for having a focused and inclusive administration under the watch of Prince Abiodun.\n\nHe urged them to continue to support the governor for the successful implementation of his \u201cBuilding Our Future Together\u201d agenda.\n\nOn the honourary Ogun State indigene given to him, the President said: \u201cIt is also with a sense of responsibility that I receive and cherish the honourary indigeneship bestowed on me as symbolised by the presentation of the key to the Gateway State by Governor Abiodun.\n\n\u201cI will leave Ogun State with fond memories and look forward to enjoying the privilege of my honourary indigeneship.\u2019\u2019\n\nAbiodun said that his administration\u2019s projects and programmes are deliberate and guided by a vision to give Ogun focused and qualitative governance and create an enabling environment for a thriving public-private sector partnership.\n\nThe governor told the President that all state government projects have the inputs and are informed by the needs of the people as expressed by them at different engagement fora.\n\nReminding the President that Ogun has highest number of federal roads in the country, Abiodun requested that state be accorded a Special Status for Federal Government Infrastructural Funding, especially on roads.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: Pressure mounts on Osinbajo",
          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe race for President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023 has begun in earnest.\n\nIn Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, and across the country, \u201cpowerful forces across the political and corporate sphere\u201d are allegedly mounting pressure on Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to throw his hat into the ring to succeed his boss.\n\nBut mum, so far, is the response from the Vice-President. Calls to his aides went unanswered.\n\nOn Monday, Osinbajo\u2019s political benefactor and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, formally informed President Buhari of his 2023 presidential ambition during a visit to the President\u2019s Aso Rock, Abuja, office.\n\nRegardless, Daily Sun learnt that, with Tinubu\u2019s Monday declaration, \u201cthe dynamics have changed.\u201d\n\nReligion as stumbling block\n\nA party source told Daily Sun that, prior to Tinubu\u2019s declaration of interest, the Vice-President has been under intense pressure from some interest groups, cutting across political and corporate sectors, to run for President in 2023.\n\nThe calculation, according to the source, is that religion would play a major role in who succeeds Buhari in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Vice-President is under pressure to run from many interest groups and some \u2018powerful forces,\u2019 on the grounds that, if Asiwaju runs, then religion would be a decisive factor.\n\n\u201cThe North, particularly the North West, which has the bulk of northern votes, would not necessarily queue behind a Christian deputy and give him their votes. It\u2019s an open secret that they want the Vice-President\u2019s ticket; in the event that the APC (All Progressives Congress) finally decides to go to the South to pick its presidential candidate. \u201cSecondly, the southern candidate must be Christian, to balance out the eight years of President Buhari.\u201d\n\nProdded to name some of the \u201cpowerful forces,\u201d he replied curtly: \u201cThis is not the time for that but those encouraging him to run premise it on two factors: Age and religion. On account of age, he\u2019s young, and he\u2019s a Christian.\u201d\n\nHowever, a senior party official privy to the matter described the pressure on Osinbajo as \u201cmere speculation. You cannot shave the Vice-President\u2019s head in his absence\u2026The real fight, right now, is for control of the party.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, another party source reiterated that the major obstacle for the APC and the 2023 presidency is still religion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe permutation right now, if nothing happens to change that, is for the APC to produce a Christian candidate, from the South, backed by a northern Muslim as deputy.\n\n\u201cThe North West, as it stands, is insisting on picking the Vice-President\u2019s ticket and would not compromise on that\u2026At the moment, three governors and a serving minister have positioned themselves to be the choice of the party. The North, particularly the North West, would not be disposed to having a Christian representing them\u2026\u201d\n\nChoice of running mate\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nEven though the jostle for running mate among some governors in the North is at fever pitch, there is the clamour that the deputy should be picked from the North West.\n\n\u201cThree governors, one from the North East and another two from the North West, who are serving out their second terms, are keenly interested in oinking the Vice-President ticket of the APC. Initially, the agreement was to draft a Christian, second-term governor from the South West into the presidential race, who would, in turn, choose one of them as his deputy, after getting the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cBut the odds are not in his favour. For one, he would be out of the power loop by the time the intense power game starts, and, secondly, he may not have the war chest to go through electioneering,\u201d the source said.\n\nControl of party structure\n\nThe struggle for control of the party\u2019s structure, through the instrumentality of the party\u2019s National Working Committee, is high.\n\nThe battle for control of the party goes back to the 2013 merger of ACN, ANPP, a faction of APGA and CPC.\n\nWith the merger, which produced the APC, it was agreed that the CPC would produce the President while the ACN would produce the Vice-President and, as an icing on the cake, the ACN got to produce two national chairmen of the party.\n\nBut, after the 2019 presidential election, the CPC decided to go for broke, and, to a large extent, together with the ANPP bloc, realised they no longer needed the ACN bloc for the next round of elections. \u201cThat was why the preparation for 2023 started with edging out the former national chairman. The CPC is intent on producing officers for strategic positions in the party.\u201d\n\nAs at this month, the contending interests in APC, particularly the CPC bloc \u201cdon\u2019t have the numbers yet. They would have to woo states with highest numbers of delegates for the convention: Lagos, Kano, Borno and Katsina, because these states are not in CPC\u2019s hands. Organically, they don\u2019t have the numbers as yet.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why the convention cannot hold in February is because there\u2019s confusion on the way forward. Some influential party members are insisting on the presidential nomination before the delegates\u2019 convention. That cannot happen because it\u2019s like putting the cart before the horse. Another set of stakeholders is trying to persuade the President that the convention, even if it\u2019s going to be by consensus to choose the new NWC, should be allowed to hold soon.\u201d\n\nConsensus to choose party chairman, others\n\n\u201cFour governors, one from the North East, another from the North Central and two from the North West are strategising for a national chairman from the CPC bloc but they are yet to agree on a particular candidate, even as it emerged that a top shot in the party has asked to be allowed to produce candidates for the national chairman and national secretary positions,\u201d was the submission of a top party shot in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe other alternative, he added, yesterday, is to allow for consensus and \u201cthat\u2019s why the convention for February was struck off the table.\u201d\n\nThe APC has been beset with internal squabbles over the national convention. Last year (June 2021), it was shifted to December and, later, last November, it was shifted to February after some governors met with the President.\n\nThe President is expected is to meet with \u201cAPC governors to \u2018firmly agree\u2019 on a convention date and the mode of choosing candidates for the NWC.\u201d",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nNigerians went wild in celebration, Wednesday evening, as the Federal Government finally lifted the ban on the operations of microblogging and social networking service, Twitter effective from 12am January 13.\n\nThe social media app was suspended on June 5, 2021 as the government cited persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence. Economic watchers say billions of naira has been lost since the ban as most Nigerians use it as a platform to run their businesses.\n\nHowever, Kashifu Inuwa, the Director General of the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency, (NITDA) while announcing the cherry news, said it was based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe immediate and remote cause of the suspension was the unceasing use of the platform by some unscrupulous elements for subversive purposes and criminal activities, propagation of fake news, and polarising Nigerians along tribal and religious lines, among others. These issues bordering on national security, cohesion and the effects of the abuse of the Twitter platform forced the the Federal Government to suspend the operation of Twitter to address the direct and collateral issues around its operations in Nigeria.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

These platforms can be used as either a tool or a weapon.\n\nEvery nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently. Without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake. \u201cTherefore, our action is a deliberate attempt to recalibrate our relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for our nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the Company. Our engagement has been very respectful, cordial, and successful.\n\n\u201cThe process of resolving this impasse between the FGN and Twitter Inc. has helped lay a foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities. Twitter is a platform of choice for many Nigerians ranging from young innovators to public sector officials who find it helpful to engage their audience. Therefore, our engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria. Furthermore, the FGN looks forward to providing a conducive environment for Twitter and other global tech companies to achieve their potential and be sustainably profitable in Nigeria\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nInuwa hailed all Nigerians, especially the vibrant Nigerian youths who have borne with the long wait to resolve this impasse, stressing that the government was happy to say that the gains made from this shared national sacrifice are immeasurable.",

          "text": "\u2022Makinde cancels state event to mourn predecessor\n\n\u2022Obasanjo, Jonathan, Atiku, Tinubu, Gbajabiamila, Sanwo-Olu, Fayemi, others pay tributes\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Segun James in Lagos, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti, and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, commiserated with the family of former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Christopher Alao-Akala, and the government and people of the state on the demise of the ex-governor. Alao-Akala, who was governor of Oyo State between 2007 and 2011, died at his Ogbomoso country home early yesterday at 71.\n\nA statement by the family, signed by his son, Olamijuwonlo Alao-Akala, said their father died peacefully.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWith humble acceptance of the will of God, we announce the passing of our grandfather, father, husband, and leader, His Excellency, Otunba (Dr.) Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, JP, PSC, which occurred on Wednesday, 12th January 2022.\n\n\u201cBaba died peacefully in Ogbomoso at the age of 71. Omo Iya Alaro will remain in our hearts forever. Rest in Peace Baba.\n\n\u201cBurial arrangements will be announced by the family at a later date.\u201d\n\nBuhari, in a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, said Alao-Akala, as a former police officer and civilian governor with an extensive political career, served the country and the people of Oyo State with dedication, making very important contributions to the development of institutions and communities.\n\nThe president hoped that family, friends and associates, who mourned the former governor, would honour his vision of entrenching good governance in the country and passion to lift the downtrodden in the society. He prayed God Almighty to grant the departed eternal rest and comfort those he left behind.\n\nThe late All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain was said to be full of life Tuesday night, during which he spent time with his children before he went to bed.\n\nOyo State Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde, on learning of Alao-Akala\u2019s passing, abruptly ended the 2022 Inter-faith Prayer Service organised by the state\u2019s civil service. Makinde called for a minute silence in memory of the former governor, who also served as deputy governor of the state between 2003 and 2007, and prayed to God to grant repose to his soul.\n\nThe governor condoled with the immediate family of the deceased, his political associates, and residents of the state.\n\nMakinde stated at the inter-faith prayer meeting, \u201cI am here with the speech prepared for this event but I have just been informed about the death of former governor of the state, Otunba Adebayo Akala. I pray that God grant his loved ones and all his well-wishers the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nObasanjo: An Amiable Cop, Akala Was Above Narrow Precincts\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo said the vacuum created by the death of Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala would be difficult to fill. Obasanjo urged the former governor\u2019s admirers to put their faith in the Almighty Creator in the present situation.\n\nIn a condolence letter to the head of Akala Family in Ibadan, Obasanjo said his death \u201cis, indeed, a grievous loss to the entire members of his family, his friends and associates, Oyo State and, indeed, the entire nation.\u201d He added that Alao-Akala as a cop transcended narrow precincts.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s letter, which was made available to newsmen in Abeokuta by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, stated, \u201cOtunba Alao-Akala was an outstanding Nigerian and leader, who contributed immensely to the development and stability of Oyo State and Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\u201cAs an amiable cop, he transcended the narrow precincts of what used to be cultural limitation to tower over his peers. From a distinguished career of a crime buster, he straddled the \u2018Pacesetter State\u2019 like a colossus. His humble career as a policeman did not stymie his ascendancy to the height of a governor and, unprecedentedly, crowned him as a high achieving deputy governor, who became an acting governor and later governor.\n\n\u201cThere seemed to be nothing stopping the effervescent enigma. His politics had been that of a thoroughbred statesman determined to make the critical difference in the lives of the people he led and he succeeded in building confidence across a wide spectrum of the social strata and validated the mandate bestowed on him as the Executive Governor of Oyo State. Indeed, the vacuum created by his death would, undoubtedly, be difficult to fill. I assure you that we all share your sense of deep grief.\u201d\n\nJonathan: He Was a Committed Public Servant\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, joined other Nigerians to mourn Alao-Akala, saying the deceased was a dedicated public servant, who served the nation to the best of his abilities.\n\nStressing that the late politician died at a time his services were still needed, Jonathan stated, \u201cHe was a public-spirited individual, who excelled in many endeavours in both his private and public life, and never got tired of giving his best to the task of nation-building.\n\n\u201cAs a police officer, he rose through the ranks and diligently served the nation in various capacities before retiring as an Assistant Commissioner of Police. He was a key player in the Fourth Republic politics, especially, in Oyo State, where he served as deputy governor and governor.\u201d\n\nThe former president highlighted Alao-Akala\u2019s considerable achievements, saying he would \u201cbe sadly missed, because he still had a lot to offer, given his experience, wisdom and determination to contribute to the development of the nation.\u201d\n\nAtiku: His Record as Governor Remains Enviable\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar mourned the passing of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, but took solace in his enviable record as governor.\n\nWhile describing his death as a rude shock, Atiku, in a press release by his media office, said Alao-Akala was a prolific politician. He condoled with the people and government of Oyo State on the loss of a notable leader, and urged his family and associates to take solace in the good legacies he left behind.\n\nTinubu: Alao-Akala\u2019s Passing is Disheartening\n\nNational leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said the death of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, a month after the death of Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, was disheartening.\n\nIn a condolence statement by his media office, signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, Tinubu said, \u201cI received the news of the passing of former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Alao-Akala, with shock and deep sadness.\n\n\u201cComing a month after the death of Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, the loss of Alao- Akala, another eminent son of Ogbomoso and Oyo State, is disheartening. Alao-Akala was a leader and prominent politician, who did his best not only for his Ogbomoso hometown, but also Oyo State and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe served the country meritoriously in the police force, rising to the top of the ladder before venturing into politics. As governor of Oyo State, he contributed his quota to the development of the state and tried to enhance the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cAlao-Akala passed on when the state and, particularly, our All Progressives Congress, needed his services. His wisdom and experience were required to help resolve the leadership crisis in the state and weld the party together once again.\u201d\n\nAlao-Akala Was a Strong APC Pillar, Says Gbajabiamila\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, expressed sadness over the death of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, and described him as a strong pillar of the APC. Gbajabiamila, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, recalled the good leadership Alao-Akala provided in Oyo State, when he served as governor, saying he made his mark in the state.\n\nAs a chieftain of the APC, Gbajabiamila said Alao-Akala was at the forefront of efforts to promote progressive politics. Sending his condolences to the Alao-Akala family, the people and the government of Oyo State, the speaker prayed God to grant Alao-Akala\u2019s soul eternal rest.\n\nSanwo-Olu: His Demise Has Opened a Deep Sore\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the death of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala had opened a deep sore in the hearts of the people of Oyo State and Nigeria, who looked up to him as a rallying point and a political stabiliser.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who commiserated with his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, and the APC family in the state, also consoled the deceased\u2019s family, noting that the former governor\u2019s service to the people of Ogbomoso, Oyo State and Nigeria as a whole remained his enduring legacy.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Lagos, I commiserate with my brother, the Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, sons and daughters of Ogbomoso, people of Oyo State, the deceased family, friends, and political associates on the death of Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala.\n\n\u201cThe passage of Otunba Alao-Akala hurts me, because of the critical role he was playing in Oyo APC before his demise. My heart was filled with grief, when I was informed about his death.\n\n\u201cOtunba Alao-Akala was more than a politician. He was a man of many parts, whose managerial skills and experience are required at this critical period in our national life, especially, in our party, APC, ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cHe served Oyo State passionately, first, as a deputy governor and later as governor. He did his best in contributing his quota to the growth and development of Ogbomoso, as council chairman as well as Oyo State as a governor. He also made his mark in the Nigeria Police, where he retired as Assistant Commissioner of Police in 1995 before venturing into politics.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu urged the family of the deceased to take heart, saying, \u201cThe death of loved ones is usually one of the most painful episodes in peoples\u2019 lives but we must realise that death is inevitable. We all will die someday. Therefore, we must muster enough strength to carry on.\u201d\n\nAlao-Akala Was a Pragmatic Leader, Says Fayemi\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, condoled with the government and people of Oyo State on the death of Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, describing him as a pragmatic leader.\n\nExtolling the virtues of the deceased, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi said the late Alao-Akala was a colourful politician, pragmatic leader, and a man of the people in and out of office. Fayemi said he was shocked by the death of the former governor, who, according to him, was in his usual high spirit during their last meeting and showed no sign of illness.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor described Alao-Akala as an apostle of politics without bitterness and a leader, whose interaction, influence and network cut across political divides. He noted that Alao-Akala played a prominent role in the restoration of peace to the Oyo State chapter of APC and inter-party harmony in the state.\n\nAccording to Fayemi, Alao-Akala\u2019s life was defined by service to the people, first, as a police officer, rising to the rank of Assistant Commissioner, and later, as a politician, public servant, and elder statesman, whose doors were always open to the common man.\n\nBuni: He Increased the Fortunes of APC\n\nChairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor, Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, described Adebayo Alao-Akala as a man, who increased the fortunes of APC in Oyo and the country at large.\n\nBuni, in a statement, expressed shock over Alao-Akala\u2019s death, stating, \u201cThe APC has received with sorrow, the death of former Governor of Oyo State and APC chieftain in the state. It is with grief and sorrow that we lost His Excellency, Alao Akala at this moment of our national life.\u201d\n\nBuni said Alao-Akala was a national political asset that was sought after by all political parties, adding, \u201cIt is saddening that we lost this asset at a time when we commenced the process to our next general election.\u201d\n\nHe condoled with Alao-Akala\u2019s family, the government and people of Oyo State over the huge loss.\n\nChairman, Senate Committee on Local Content and senator for Oyo Central, Senator Teslim Folarin, also said he was heartbroken by the news of Alao-Akala\u2019s death, lamenting that Oyo State has lost a phenomenal statesman.\n\nFolarin, in a statement he personally signed, stated that the former governor\u2019s death came \u201cat a crucial time his leadership and wise counsel are needed, especially, by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply heartbroken after receiving the shocking news of our leader\u2019s demise. I still could not believe that Oga Akala has left us. Who are we to question God\u2019s Decision?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the APC in the state described Alao-Akala\u2019s death as sad and shocking. A statement by the Caretaker Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Dr. AbdulAzeez Olatunde, said Oyo APC lost one of its pillars.\n\nOlatunde stated, \u201cLess than two years after the loss of His Excellency, Senator Abiola Adeyemi Akanji Ajimobi, APC in Oyo State, on Wednesday, 12th January, 2022, shockingly got the sad news of the demise of one of the pillars of the party, His Excellency, Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala.\n\n\u201cAPC commiserates with party members in Oyo State and diaspora, especially, all Oyo State indigenes on the sad and shocking news.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the caretaker chairman of APC in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, the state executives, and all the APC members in Oyo State, we commiserate with the family of our departed former governor.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says social media platform has agreed to respect Nigeria\u2019s laws\n\nBy Olawale Ajimotokan\n\n\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria has lifted the ban on Twitter effective from 12 midnight of January 13, 2022.\n\nThis comes exactly 222 days after the government suspended the Twitter in the country.\n\nThe lifting of the ban was announced yesterday in a statement issued by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and the Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdulahi, who said the approval was granted following a memo written to the President by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim, after the social networking platform agreed to respect Nigeria\u2019s laws and culture.\n\nThe NITDA DG said, Pantami in the Memo, updated and requested the president\u2019s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe federal government directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am tonight, 13th January 2022.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that on 5th June 2021, the FGN suspended the operation of Twitter through an announcement made by the Honourable Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the President constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc. Subsequently, in its wisdom, the Presidential Committee set a 20-member Technical Committee comprising all relevant government agencies. The Technical Committee engaged and worked directly with the Twitter team,\u201d Abdulahi explained in the statement. The federal government had suspended Twitter\u2019s operation in the country on June 5, 2021, after the social media platform deleted some tweets made by the president which it had perceived were not appropriate. However, Abdulahi said the ban was lifted after Twitter agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation had been built. In addition, he said the company has agreed to collaborate with the federal government and the broader industry to develop a Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries. Other conditions which Twitter accepted included committing to setting up an establishment in the country in the first quarter of this year. The company would register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), with the establishment of the entity being Twitter\u2019s first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria. Also, Twitter has agreed to appoint a designated country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities as well as complying with applicable tax obligations on its operations under the Nigerian law. The statement stressed that Twitter has agreed to enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, which provides a direct channel for government officials and Twitter staff to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules. The federal government said the Law Enforcement Portal provides a channel for the law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian Laws. \u201cTherefore, the FGN lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13th January 2022. \u201cWe encourage all users of the Twitter platform to maintain ethical behaviour and refrain from promoting divisive, dangerous, and distasteful information on the platform. \u201cAs patriotic citizens, we need to be mindful that anything illegal offline is also illegal online and that committing a crime using a Nigerian Internet Protocol (IP) is synonymous with committing a crime within our jurisdiction,\u201d Abdulahi said. He described government\u2019s action as a deliberate attempt to recalibrate its relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for the nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the company. \u201cThe new global reality is that digital platforms and their operators wield enormous influence over the fabric of our society, social interaction and economic choices. These platforms can be used as either a tool or a weapon. Every nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently. Without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake. Therefore, our engagement has been very respectful, cordial, and successful,\u201d he said. He added that the process of resolving the impasse between the federal government and Twitter has helped lay a foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities. He described Twitter as a platform of choice for many Nigerians ranging from young innovators to public sector officials who find it helpful to engage their audience He said the engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria, adding government looks forward to providing a conducive environment for Twitter and other global tech companies to achieve their potential and be sustainably profitable in Nigeria. Abdulahi noted that given Twitter\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s democracy, its economy, and the very fabric of its corporate existence as a nation, government\u2019s priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter, adding the country is committed to working with Twitter to do anything possible to help Nigerians align and navigate Twitter algorithmic design to realise its potentials while avoiding its perils.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Nigerian lady based in Vienna, Austria, Susan Edeh, has narrated in an interview how a pastor of Omega Fire Ministries identified as Jesse, his wife and church members brutalised her after she requested a refund of a loan she gave to the church to pay up rent arrears.\n\nAccording to her, Jesse had reached out to her to support him with the payment of church rent to avoid eviction.\n\nSaharaReporters had on January 3 reported that Edeh, who is also a member of the church founded by Apostle Johnson Suleman, was brutalised by the pastor who she had agreed to support and had taken a loan from her bank for the purpose.\n\nIt had also been reported that Pastor Jesse promised to pay back the loan but refused after several years.\n\nAccording to her, anytime she requested a repayment, the pastor would start blackmailing and threatening to deal with her.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Edeh paid a visit to the church on Sunday, January 2 in a bid to clear the air on issues surrounding the loans.\n\nHowever, rather than a peaceful resolution as she had envisaged, trouble erupted as members of the church allegedly beat her, her child and the father of her children.\n\nShe said she was beaten to an extent that she lost a lot of blood but for the intervention of the police.\n\nIn an interview, Edeh said, \u201cI live in Austria in Vienna city. On Sunday 2nd January, I had prepared to go to my church so I decided to go to Omega Fire Ministries where I used to attend. I recently stopped, to talk to members and the pastor concerning the loans I loaned him which they used to pay the rent for the church. I wanted to speak with everybody so we could just have an agreement concerning it. See Also Scandal Exclusive: Pastor In Apostle Suleman's Omega Fire Ministry Allegedly Brutalises Austria-based Nigerian Lady For Asking Repayment Of Five-year-old Loan\n\n\u201cI got there with my three kids. I got to the church, we were at the altar actually dancing, they finished and the pastor said someone should give me the microphone; as I was about to talk, the problem started.\n\n\u201cI was just waving my hand and saying 'praise the Lord' when the father of my kids stood up to make a video and a lady kicked his phone off his hands and all of a sudden, they started kicking him and the pastor actually made a statement with the microphone telling them, \u2019beat Solomon, take him away from here\u2019.\n\n\u201cI walked down to where the wife was standing and told her they should stop this, this is not why we came, I just came to talk to them. There's been a lot of blackmails, issues talks that have been going on concerning me.\n\n\u201cI also heard from some people I know from Auchi. Three weeks ago, the pastor made some videos and said some things that were not right and this is a church that I've been to for six years and I have friends there, even though I've not been there for two months now.\n\n\u201cIn October 2021 when I told him they had to pay the money as agreed since 2019, he came up with a lot of text messages and voice notes threatening me. I felt it was better I speak out and bring clarity to the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time he assaulted me for requesting for the money, early last year, I felt I couldn't stay in the church anymore so I informed him and his wife that I was going to be leaving, I decided to make it official because I worked with him. I also wanted to know every other arrangement on payment because I don't think I'd come back again.\n\nWhen asked if she had any piece of evidence to show that the pastor was actually owing her, she said, \u201cWhen the money issue came, as soon as I went to collect it, I just went to his office and gave him cash at hand but he never denied the fact that he's owing me because the church is actually paying 180 Euros into my account once in a while, that's the only evidence I have.\u201d\n\nNarrating further how the January 2 event happened, Edeh stated: \u201cThe beating started with the pastor because I was standing by him, someone already started beating the father of my children, so I went towards that side, he was also there and I told him to tell them to stop and then someone pushed me to him.\n\n\u201cIt was like me resting myself on him because of the push from behind and then he immediately hit me and started beating me up, the church members also joined, I felt a lot of hands on me.\n\n\u201cI was going down on my knees and I couldn't hold him anymore but I saw the shoe of my daughter and heard her voice also, I just kind of had the strength to get up as I heard her voice.\n\n\u201cI saw the pastor's wife beside me so I grabbed her skirt to stand up so when they saw I was already up, they immediately started taking her away from me, that was how I escaped from them. An ambulance came and took me to the hospital.\u201d\n\nOn how she has been coping with the loan repayment at the bank where she reportedly took it from, Edeh said, \u201cThere's a certain amount I pay to the bank every month and every three months, I also pay a certain amount to the bank for owing and credit so this makes it two different kinds of payment, they take it automatically from my account.\u201d\n\nOn the intervention by the head church in Nigeria, Edeh said she already informed the wife to the General Overseer of the church, Lizzy Johnson Suleman of the loan in October last year and with the recent incident, she had to forward pictures and videos to her but she never got a response.",

          "title": "A year to Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections, its government lifts Twitter ban",
          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily.

The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter.

          "summary": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari.\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules.\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter.",

          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

From the details of the agreement, the microblogging platform has agreed to some conditions which must be fulfilled before Q1 2022 ends.\n\nTwitter has shown a willingness to register as a company in Nigeria, appoint a country representative to act as a liaison between the company and the Federal Government. In addition to enrolling Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, the company has also agreed to applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.\n\nUsers\u2019 reactions\n\nSince the announcement\u2026\n\nWe are pleased that Twitter has been restored for everyone in Nigeria. Our mission in Nigeria & around the world, is to serve the public conversation.\n\nWe are deeply committed to Nigeria, where Twitter is used by people for commerce, cultural engagement, and civic participation.

Going by recent cases, it is commonplace to find these organisations severely sanctioned for violating rules with grey areas.\n\nLocal telecommunications companies are unlikely to push back when orders clearly violating citizens\u2019 fundamental right of access to information are given. Ordinarily, this does not apply to social media sites because they are not under their jurisdiction.\n\nEven though it seems the company might be giving the government too much discretionary power, it chose to negotiate rather than go the litigation route, as was the case in India.\n\nA flawed precedent?\n\nIf any other country has given Twitter a hard time, it\u2019s India. The repression started early in 2021 when, on the premise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government gave the order to deactivate or suspend. Asides from that, the company failed to comply with the country\u2019s IT rules. In the months that followed, Twitter ran into more problems with the government, leading to the police visiting the company\u2019s office in India to serve a notice.\n\nBy July, Twitter agreed to comply with all government conditions following a legal suit fully. The court directed Twitter to issue a statement saying it intends to abide by the rules.\n\nIndia made a scapegoat of Twitter, which became an example for other Big Tech companies. As the government argued, Twitter has lost legal immunity for users\u2019 posts in India. Could this be the Nigerian government\u2019s plan?\n\nIf anything, strong-arming is common with governments that have shown authoritarian traits in the past and global company compliance might only fuel it.\n\nFar from over: Possible tales of \u2018once again\u2019\n\nWhile China is considered the region with the strictest Internet shutdowns, Africa is often regarded as the most volatile environment for social media. Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s history of Internet shutdowns dates back to 2007 with Guinea, and it was only a matter of time before other countries followed suit, with Nigeria joining the trend in 2020.\n\nCurrently, 32 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries have restricted access to the Internet for similar reasons ranging from protests to strikes. Elections, national security, and examinations also present opportunities for restrictions. Specifically, shutdowns have proven to be one of the government\u2019s tools to control information and communication.\n\nIt thus appears that a successful Internet shutdown in a country might result in many more. Ethiopia, for instance, has had 12 Internet shutdowns, and as of 2020, Chad had accumulated almost two and a half years of Internet disruptions within five years.\n\nWhile circumventing social media censorship with VPNs appears to be the easiest way out, the issue of privacy and free speech are still cause for worry.

          "title": "Crazily high valuations, investor FOMO, the ripple effects of Y Combinator\u2019s new deal",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, January 10, 2022, startup accelerator Y Combinator announced that it would be increasing its deal size for future investments from $125,000 to $500,000. For many, the news was great because founders would get more money from the accelerator.\n\nHowever, quite a few people have expressed concerns about what this could mean for founders and investors. Here, we look at the deal and what it means for African founders.\n\nWhat is YC\u2019s new deal?\n\nAccording to the terms of the new deal, Y Combinator will invest $125,000 for 7% of a company as it has always done. However, it will also invest an additional $375,000 on \u201can uncapped safe with a Most Favored Nation (\u201cMFN\u201d) provision.\u201d This second provision has some people worried, but first, what is an MFN?\n\nNB: SAFE is short for simple agreement for future equity. It is an agreement that allows investors to invest in a company with a promise from the company to give stocks to the investor when they raise a priced round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most favoured nation status is not peculiar to the venture capital world and has been used for years in international trade and international politics. According to Investopedia, the MFN clause requires that a country provides the same concessions it does to one nation to all World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries.\n\nExtrapolating to venture capital and YCs deal specifically means that when YC startups raise their next round, YCs $375k investment will be converted to shares in the company at the most favourable terms of any investor in the round. In other words, YC is giving startups an extra $375,000 at a future valuation that they (Y Combinator) don\u2019t control.\n\nWhat does this mean for African startups and founders?\n\nOn the surface, this sounds like a better deal for African startup founders \u2013 $500k upfront is a lot of money and could help stave off the pressure to raise immediately if the startup runs a lean operation.\n\nKevin Simmons thinks this is a great deal for founders. \u201cFrom the founder\u2019s side, if you\u2019re looking to raise $1 million, for instance, with YC offering you half of that, it\u2019s a no-brainer to take the deal and get the balance from other investors.\n\n\u201cIt could also mean that founders increasingly go after YC. So if you\u2019re the competition and your customers are going in one direction, you either have to offer them more money or better terms to compete because you don\u2019t want to lose the best companies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave is a Y Combinator portfolio company and its most valuable African startup.\n\nOne issue that has been raised is how difficult it is for startups in Africa to raise at high valuations. However, that is not entirely correct. Raising money at high valuations would always be tough because founders need to convince investors that their businesses are worth as much as they say\n\nBut there has been such astronomical growth in the funding landscape that stakeholders now have conversations about extremely high startup valuations \u2014 an issue that was non-existent just a few years ago. In 2021, startups in Africa raised about $4.3 billion \u2014 2.5x the amount raised in 2020. With more money flowing into the ecosystem, startups will find it easier to raise money at high valuations.\n\nMost startups raise money to stay afloat before joining YC. However, YC acceptance has been seen as a sign of validation for startups, especially for African startups. This has made it easier for them to raise money from investors after YCs Demo Day as they receive increased visibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Simmons, \u201cThere are two ways to look at Y Combinator\u2019s deal. If you go into Y Combinator, you\u2019re setting yourself up for high expectations anyway, and it\u2019s because YC is believed to be thorough in their screening and selection of great startups. Those expectations come down to dollars and cents, which means they have to raise at higher valuations and build bigger businesses post-YC.\u201d\n\nWith the new deal, YC gets a larger piece of the startup post-YC at the same value as subsequent investors. For the founders, it means giving up a larger part of their company before they have gotten to the Series A round.\n\nSince the announcement, many investors, most of whom are from minority regions such as Latin America and Africa, have expressed concern that this could shut out local investors from the cap table \u2014 a vital move for startups that hope to tap into the local network these investors provide. However, not all investors in these regions agree.\n\nBiola Alabi, an angel investor, believes that the benefits of going through YC will outweigh any perceived disadvantages of the deal.\n\n\u201cI think that most early-stage investors will also benefit as long as they come in early. The benefit of going through YC will outweigh some of the initial trepidations around if this will affect smaller investors. The most important thing is to believe and invest with conviction. Valuations will work themselves out. The market will also dictate these in the end.\u201d\n\nDespite the increase in investment going into African startups, there is still a need for super early investors who can come in either at the pre-seed or seed stages. For the most part, African startups at this stage have raised little amounts of capital, usually under $2 million. However, YCs move could exclude most angel investors and smaller VCs who invest at this round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave co-founders Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk (right). Wave is a Y Combinator portfolio company.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this change will affect other accelerators and investors, but Simmons believes that because of the growth witnessed in 2021, local investors will have an easier time raising capital from LPs which means they can invest higher amounts in startups.\n\nHe also points out that startups will probably think twice about joining YC just because of the brand.\n\n\u201cIf you went to YC before for the name thinking the 7% was not a big sacrifice to make, now you have to take $500k, and yes, it\u2019s not all at 7%, but it gives them more influence.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the founders either have to raise smaller amounts before getting into YC or abandon the idea entirely, as raising future rounds at low valuations would mean giving up huge parts of the company. On the flip side, this could mean that local investors bet on these startups early enough without waiting for the validation that comes with a YC acceptance.\n\nInvestors have typically shied away from using uncapped SAFEs, but YCs willingness to use them could be a game-changer.\n\n\u201cWith YC being such a big brand, will other investors be more willing to take on uncapped SAFEs? Just like the SAFE became standard practice, could we see the uncapped SAFE gain more acceptance?\u201d Simmons queried.\n\nModupe Odele, a lawyer and Founder of Vazi Legal, advises that startups that want YC onboard should ensure they get angel checks before signing YCs MFN SAFE. Furthermore, they need a lawyer to review the terms to ensure that the MFN clause is not retroactive. However, going by YCs announcement, it doesn\u2019t appear that this is the case.\n\nThere are no indications that YCs deal should keep founders up at night. Since it funded the first African startup in 2009, it has only funded 66 African startups. With over 800 deals done in Africa in 2021, that represents a tiny portion of deals that go on in Africa. Should other investors follow suit, that could become worrisome.\n\nWith Africa\u2019s startup funding landscape not yet at the level of its American and European counterparts, it could get more challenging for African startups to raise money locally if they wish to go through Y Combinator. On the other hand, it could encourage more local investors to scout and invest in companies at really early stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

According to Abdullahi, the ban will be lifted at precisely 12 a.m., Thursday, January 13, 2022. I\u2019m writing this newsletter a day before, so I can\u2019t confirm if Twitter will work without a VPN.\n\nHowever, I hope it works because I have officially exited my VPN Family subscription WhatsApp group.\n\nThe federal government indefinitely blocked access to Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.

The report quoted the mining minister as having confirmed the interest which could pivotal for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey are looking at the possibility of coming to look at opportunities in Nigeria,\u201d Olamilekan Adegbite said in an interview at a mining conference in Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital, Riyadh.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous nation is hoping investors will follow the example of Thor Explorations Ltd., which has built the country\u2019s first industrial gold project, as it seeks to cut its dependence on oil earnings.\n\nVancouver-based Thor poured first gold from its mine in southwestern Nigeria in July last year and is targeting output of 85,000 ounces a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy and delighted because they have succeeded and so give the right signal for investors,\u201d Adegbite said.\n\nRead also: Global oil, gas investment projected to grow by $26bn in 2022\n\nToronto-based Barrick, the world\u2019s second biggest gold miner, is among the firms \u201cinterested in coming to Nigeria,\u201d while the government \u201chas spoken with\u201d London-based Rio, the top iron ore producer, about opportunities in the country, Adegbite said without providing additional details.\n\nThe government intends to auction rights to mine gold, lithium, copper and limestone later this year, he said.\n\nBarrick and Rio didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous nation has sizeable reserves of metals including gold, zinc, lead and iron ore, but nearly all extraction is done informally with rudimentary equipment. Before Thor\u2019s launch, the contribution of mining to gross domestic product stood at less than 0.1%.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, mining made up 4% to 5% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, before major operations shut down and crude oil came to dominate the government\u2019s agenda.\n\nGold smuggling has also been a problem, with much of it destined for Dubai, according to Adegbite, who is seeking help from authorities in the United Arab Emirates to stem the flow.\n\n\u201cWe are in discussion with the UAE government to stop such practices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting some traction.\u201d\n\nSuccessive Nigerian governments have pledged to significantly increase mining\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product, which currently stands at less than 0.1%.\n\nThe current government which hopes to be the first to actually accomplish this, is promoting Thor\u2019s launch to spur investment in the mining sector and boost non-oil income.",

          "title": "Nigeria stocks to watch in 2022",
          "text": "The year 2021 was a roller-coaster for equities, with eight months of positive returns and four month of bearish season. The market ended with a positive return of 6.7 percent amid a remarkable last-minute rally that helped push the value of listed stocks up by N1.23 trillion.\n\nInterestingly, market liquidity and the record rally were driven majorly by domestic institutional and retail investors, thus reinforcing the potential of Nigerian investors in stabilising and growing the market.\n\nNotwithstanding imminent risks to equity market rally in 2022, Nigerian stocks are still attractive and should remain resilient in this year.\n\nThe big question now is: what stocks should investors buy in 2022? Stocks seen reoccurring in many analysts BUY lists for 2022, which investors should actively consider in their equities portfolio this year include Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, GTCO, Nestle Nigeria, Zenith Bank, BUA Cement, BUA Foods, UBA, Fidelity Bank, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, and Flour Mills of Nigeria.\n\nCurrently in the Nigerian market, many of these stocks are undervalued and present attractive BUY opportunities for investors seeking both capital appreciation and for long-term returns.\n\n\u201cCompanies such as Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, GTCO, Nestle and Zenith Bank, which are our top picks, are resilient bellwethers with the history of sustaining earnings growth through political cycles,\u201d according to Isaac Olorungbon, chief executive, Deep Trust and Investments Limited.\n\nHe remains upbeat on the prospect of the Nigerian stock market in 2022, \u201cas our cautious optimism reinforces our outlook of another positive return for Nigerian equity investors in the new year.\u201d\n\nOthers are: Unilever Nigeria, Okomu Oil Palm, Presco, Vitafoam, Berger Paints, Ardova, Seplat, and Total Energies Marketing Nigeria. Also on analysts BUY list are Dangote Sugar Refinery, Guinness Nigeria, Conoil, FCMB Group, May & Baker, Fidson Healthcare, and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAmid increasing optimism in the market, a likely modest rise in the interest rate environment may undermine funds flow to equities in 2022, but a positive earnings outlook across most largely capitalised value stocks should reinforce the investment opportunities in these stocks.\n\nDangote Cement\n\nDangote Cement is Africa\u2019s leading cement producer with existing operations in 10 African countries with a production capacity of 48.6 million tons per year. The company\u2019s share price as of January 10, 2022, was N260 per share; year-to-date (YtD) change (+1.2%), while in year 2021 the stock rose by +4.9 percent.\n\nMeristem analysts target price (TP) for Dangote Cement is N287.81; Vetiva analysts target price for the stock is N280; while United Capital analysts target price is N270.3. Going by these analysts 2022 target price for the cement maker, the stock has upside potential and should be considered a BUY.\n\nBUY rating is given to a stock considered highly undervalued, but with strong fundamentals, and where potential return in excess of or equal to 15 percent is expected to be realised between its current price and analysts\u2019 target price (TP).\n\nAhead of its full year (FY) 2021 results, its unaudited interim financial statements for nine months ended September 30, 2021, showed revenue grew to N1.022 trillion as against N761.44 billion 2021. Pre-tax profit for the nine months period was N405.487 billion as against N271.960 billion in 9M\u20192020.\n\nEarnings per share increased to N16.23 in 9M\u201921 from N12.2 in 9M\u201920. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries is to operate plants for the preparation, manufacture, and distribution of cement and related products. Sector (Industrial Goods), Sub-Sector (Building Materials), Market Classification (Premium Board), and Shares Outstanding (17,040,507,405 units).\n\nRead also: Sanwo-Olu, MTN Nigeria, Osimhen, Ndidi among nominees for Nigeria Pitch Awards\n\nMTN Nigeria\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN) is engaged in the business of building and operating Global System for Mobiles (GSM) cellular network systems and other related services.\n\nNigeria\u2019s largest telco did a public offer of its shares from December 1 to December 14, 2021, which allowed retail investors to purchase up to 575 million shares at N169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the secondary market.\n\nAs of January 10, 2022, its share price of N185.5 per share represented a negative return of 5.8 percent YtD. The stock rose by 16 percent in the year 2021. In November 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria gave it an approval-in-principle to operate a payment service bank (PSB).\n\n\u201cGoing into 2022, we believe that MTNN\u2019s 4G coverage will continue to be expansive, as it strives to meet the ever growing data needs of Nigeria\u2019s population. Thus data revenue is projected to come in at N647 billion, up 25 percent year-on-year (y/y).\n\n\u201cGiven that the NCC has lifted the suspension of new SIM card registrations, and with the company also hinting that it is actively ramping up new-registration centres, which will support the FG\u2019s NIN enrolment programme, we expect to see some gains in MTNN\u2019s subscriber base going forward. Thus, we expect this to somewhat provide a support system for voice revenue through 2022. However, we also bear in mind that voice services are subject to stiff competition, given the growing preference for internet-driven cheaper substitutes.\n\n\u201cWith the company now underway to getting a PSB licence, product offerings are up for a full-blown scale-up, and we might start to see considerable impact on MTN\u2019s top-line performance,\u201d according to Victoria Ejugwu, oil & gas, telecom\u2019s analyst at Lagos-based Vetiva.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into the 2022, we are guided by our recent Nigerian telecom sector report \u2018Delivering a Digital Future,\u2019 December 30, in which we recommend a BUY for MTNN with target price of N266.17/share and a Sell for Airtel Africa with a target price of N793.84/share,\u201d according to Coronation Research analysts in their January 4 note.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of MTNN for the nine months period ended September 30, 2021, showed that its revenue grew to N1.206 trillion from 9M\u20192020 level of N975.764 billion, up by 23.62 percent.\n\nIts profit before tax (PBT) in 9M\u201921 went up to N321.352 billion from N211.594 billion in 9M\u20192020, up by 51.87 percent; while its basic/diluted earnings per share increased to N10.82 from N7.09 in 9M\u20192020, up by 52.74 percent.\n\nSector: (ICT); Sub Sector (Telecommunications Services); Market Classification (Premium Board) and Shares Outstanding (20,354,513,050 units).\n\nSeplat Energy\n\nSeplat Energy is a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and London Stock Exchange. The company believes that the greatest opportunity ahead of it is to supply the right mix of energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and rapidly growing population and drive Nigeria\u2019s transition to cleaner, more affordable energy that is accessible to all. Seplat closed the year 2021 at N650 per share, up by 61.6 percent in 2021.\n\nAs of January 10, the stock price at N665 represents an increase of 2.3 percent YtD. In its unaudited results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, it grew revenue to N182.7 billion from N135.6 billion in 9M\u20192020.\n\nGross profit went up to N58.1 billion in 9M\u201921 from N31.7 billion in 9M\u201920. Pre-tax profit grew to N38.6 billion from loss before tax of N45.5 billion in 9M\u20192020. For Seplat, ANOH project remains on track for first gas in H1\u2019 2022.\n\n\u201cA strong step forward will be when we bring on stream the ANOH project in 2022 delivering more transition gas to an energy poor market, over reliant on expensive, high carbon-emitting electricity generated from small-scale diesel and PMS generators,\u201d said Roger Brown, CEO of Seplat Energy.\n\nUnited Capital target price for Seplat is N770.4 with BUY rating. Meristem target price is N754.42 supported with BUY rating. Vetiva also rated the stock a BUY with 2022 target price at N796.57.\n\n\u201cRecently, Seplat announced that the company was in discussions for a possible acquisition of some shallow water assets from ExxonMobil. Given that details of the acquisition are yet to be released to the public, we have not included the potential impact on the valuation of Seplat.\n\n\u201cHowever, should the deal materialises, we expect to see an increase in crude output, while we expect cost synergies to result from the integration of administrative operations for the combined entity,\u201d said Luke Ofojebe, Vetiva\u2019s head of research.\n\nSector (Oil & Gas); Sub Sector (Exploration and Production); Market Classification (Premium Board); and Shares Outstanding (588,444,561 units).\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading food and agro-allied groups, remains committed to executing its overall long-term strategy aimed at maintaining growth and sustaining profitability.\n\nRecently, Flour Mills of Nigeria and Honeywell Group Limited agreed to combine operations of FMN through its affiliates and Honeywell Flour Mills (HFMP), a portfolio company of HGL, at a total enterprise value of N80 billion, which will make Honeywell Group dispose of a 71.69 percent stake in HFMP to FMN.\n\nThe proposed transaction will combine two businesses with shared goals and create a more resilient national champion in the Nigerian foods industry, ensuring long-term job creation and preservation.\n\nA combination of FMN and HFMP will bring together two trusted and iconic brands, creating a food business that is better positioned to benefit the growing Nigerian population, further enhance national food security objectives and leverage opportunities stemming from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nFlour Mills was among best performing stocks in 2021 (+183.3%). In the trading week ended January 7, 2022, the share price of Flour Mills of Nigeria closed at N29 per share, representing an increase of 2.3 percent YtD.\n\nIn half-year (H1) (2021/2022), the Group revenue was N522.8 billion, compared to N355.1 billion in H1 2020/21, which represents 47 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth. Performance was consistent across all key business segments in the group with agro-allied and support segments in particular showing impressive growth by as much as 35 percent. In the review H1 period, the Group\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) was N15.5 billion, compared to N14.6 billion in H1 2020/21 (6% \u2013 YoY growth).\n\nThis performance was underpinned by continued strong operating performance in the food segment; continuous improvement in agro-allied and support segments. The Group\u2019s PAT was N10.5 billion, compared to N9.9 billion in H1 2020/21 (6% \u2013 YoY growth). The Group\u2019s solid operational performance was stimulated by strong organic growth, supported by product innovation, and continued momentum in retail sales.\n\nThe stock had on January 10 decreased this year by 0.9 percent. United Capital research analysts say Flour Mills is a BUY considering their target price of N46.6 for the stock. Meristem also wants investors to buy Flour Mills considering their target price of N40.63.\n\nMeristem research analysts in their January 10 stock recommendation urged investors to \u201cBUY\u201d Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc shares. Also, Vetiva\u2019s price target for Flour Mills is N44.34,\u201d said its consumer goods analyst, Chinma Ukadike.\n\n\u201cWe note that the company\u2019s volume growth strategy has been quite successful so far, across its Food and Agro-allied segments. In line with this, we remain positive on the impact of newer product roll-out expected in the coming quarters,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nSector (Consumer Goods); Sub Sector (Food Products); Market Classification (Main Board); Shares Outstanding (4,100,379,605 units).",

          "text": "Governor Bello Mohammed of Zamfara State has called for more concerted efforts in fighting banditry to ensure speedy elimination of the menace in the entire North West region and beyond.\n\nMohammed made the appeal yesterday in Gusau, the state capital when a team from President Muhammad Buhari paid him a condolence visit over the loss of lives in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas. The victims were killed by fleeing bandits following intense operations by troops and aerial attacks.\n\nTo hasten the success of the ongoing operations in the state, Governor Matawalle called on the federal government to deploy more interventions in the state including more Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and specifically, the Super Tucano fighter jets in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs part of this strategy, special forces should be deployed to some blackspots, particularly identified to be more dangerous centres of activities of the bandits. These blackspots are Gando, in Bukkuyum local government area, Munhaye of Tsafe local government area, Bayan Ruwa, in Maradun local government area, Kabaro- Sangeku, of Dansadau and Magami axis. The special forces could help dislodge the bandits and block exits to the fleeing ones.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe security challenge in Zamfara State and other states in the North West is unprecedented. It has become an existential threat for the sub region. We have virtually explored and tried all workable options in our relentless effort to address this challenge. We tried the dialogue mechanism, which has worked for some time before deliberate efforts by some misguided politicians to scuttle the process.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration has, however, tried to surmount the challenges in many faces. \u201cMy administration has made tackling the issue of insecurity its priority. Our approach is multifaceted. We have intermarried the provision of logistics and other forms of support to our security forces with an array of social intervention programmes aimed at the economic empowerment of our youths,\u201d he said.\n\nMatawalle suggested that the idea of Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs\u2019) Camps should be de-emphasised while concerted efforts at quick resettlement should be stressed through massive provision of resources by the federal and state governments and all stakeholders such as NGOs, donor agencies and profit-making organisations and individuals\n\nGovernor Matawalle further added that his administration has been supporting the security operatives in the state to make their job easier, \u201cwe procured 200 brand new Hilux pickups and distributed them to all the security agencies in the State for operational purposes. This is in addition to payment of allowances to security personnel, provision of Silent Falcon Drones, repairs of vehicles and fighting equipment, provision of office and housing accommodation and a host of other supports to our security forces\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cWe employed the service of hunters and provided them with motorcycles and allowances. Only recently we paid the service hunters the sum of N53 million, in addition to their full upkeep. In the aftermath of the recent attacks in Anka and Bukkuyum local government Areas, we expanded the sum of N250 million to provide vehicles, and allowances for both the Civilian JTF and the conventional security outfits\u2019 \u2018. Governor Matawalle added.\n\nEarlier, the Leader of the delegation and minister of defence, Major-General Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), told the governor that his team was in Gusau to extend the message of Buhari over the recent unfortunate attacks on some communities in the state.\n\nMagashi said the president is saddened with the development and promises that stronger action would be taken to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future.",

          "title": "ISWAP Attacks On The Rise, Governor Zulum Cries Out",
          "text": "Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum yesterday raised fresh concerns over the increasing activities of the Islamic State of West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists in the core and northern parts of the state.\n\nRevealing that two local government areas of the state, Guzamala and Abadam, are still being controlled by the terrorists, Zulum claimed that ISWAP terrorists are better equipped, better trained and more sophisticated than the defunct Boko Haram terrorists led by the late Abubakar Shekau, hence the need for the Nigerian military to be more decisive in dealing with them.\n\nThe Borno State governor\u2019s comments are at variance with the claims by President Muhammadu Buhari during his recent interviews on local television that no part of Nigerian territory is under the control of terrorists.\n\nThe president\u2019s assertion is also in spite of recent reports that terrorists in some states in the North West were collecting levies and taxes from locals before allowing them to have access to their farms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZulum, who disclosed this when a delegation of the Senate Committee on Army led by Senator Ali Ndume and Senator Lekan Balogun paid a courtesy at his Council Chamber in Maiduguri, further said that ISWAP terrorists were having checkpoints in Damboa and Biu local government areas of the state and collecting taxes from communities.\n\nHe berated Senator Ali Ndume for criticising the surrendering terrorists despite the fact that he, Ndume, cannot go to his hometown in Gwoza without escort, adding that the senator\u2019s community of Hambagda in Gwoza local government area had been deserted by his people due to the activities of the terrorists.\n\nZulum further stated that ISWAP terrorists had been growing in stature and making things very difficult, noting that the major problem with the Army was that when peace begins to return, the troops will relax, allowing the terrorists to regroup and take the initiative.\n\nHence, the governor urged the troops to always be on the offensive and pursue the terrorists to their enclaves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZulum said, \u201cISWAP terrorists are having checkpoints between Damboa and Biu local government areas, collecting taxes from the communities. Few days ago, I got security report that ISWAP terrorists are holding a marriage ceremony in one of the communities with the presence of over 300 motorcycles.\n\n\u201cI only have one discrepancy with Senator Ali Ndume. I heard him criticising the repentant terrorists and I felt that this should not had come from someone from Borno. We know where we were before now. Ndume cannot go to his hometown without security escort.\n\n\u201cNdume\u2019s hometown Hambagda has been deserted. Ninety-five percent of them cannot go to their farms, but the situation is different since we started witnessing the surrender of the terrorists. Areas under cultivation have increased. \u201d\n\nThe governor added that over 20,000 members of the Boko Haram terrorists had surrendered out of which 5,000 of them were fighters. No magic can be done in this war if not supported with dialogue.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that two local government areas, Guzamala and Abadam, are still under the control of the terrorists, and called for them to be retrieved from the grip of ISWAP.\n\n\u201cAnother issue is that two of our local government areas are still under the control of the terrorists. We want to see these two local government areas taken over by the owner, that is the government of Borno and the local government authorities,\u201d the governor added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZulum, however, thanked the army for restoring peace in the state even as he urged the troops to do more to stop the activities of ISWAP terrorists so that people can go back and have their livelihood.\n\nIn his speech, the leader of the delegation, Senator Ali Ndume, said that the committee was in the state to carry out its oversight functions on the army commands.\n\nHe said despite the successes of the military, they are facing some difficulties such as poor welfare of personnel and paucity of funding, among others.\n\nAt the headquarters of the Theater Command, Operation Hadin Kai, at Maimalari Cantonment in Maiduguri, Ndume commended the successes recorded by the Nigerian military in the Northeast.\n\nThe Senator, who led members of the Senate Committee on Army, who were in Borno State on an oversight function at the Command, assured the troops of the continuous support of the National Assembly and federal government toward protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country.\n\nLamenting the poor living conditions of the soldiers, Senator Ndume disclosed that N17 trillion had been budgeted for the Nigerian military to enhance their welfare and operations.\n\nHe, however, called on the troops to check the activities of terrorists in the Borno State and North East region.\n\nIn a related development, the Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna, Most Rev. Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso, yesterday expressed worry at the rising insecurity in the country.\n\nThe archbishop, while speaking to journalists in Kaduna, noted that the primary function of every government is to secure the life and property of its citizens.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari should sit up to ensure that Nigerians are safe in their homes and places of work. Our government needs to do something,\u201d he said, adding that Nigerians can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed, with people being killed every day.\n\nGunmen Kill 18 People In Plateau Village\n\nMeanwhile, the Special Task Force in charge of security in Plateau, Bauchi and some part of Southern Kaduna state, code-named Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) has confirmed the killing of 18 persons in a fresh attack in Ancha village of Bassa Local Government Council by unknown gunmen.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that the gunmen stormed the community early in the morning and started shooting sporadically. It was further gathered that several houses were razed down by the rampaging gunmen.\n\nThe OPSH, in a statement signed by the military information officer, Major Ishaku Takwa, said troops of OPSH received a distress call of an attack on Ancha Community in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau in the late hours of Tuesday, January 11, 2022,.\n\nAccording to him, troops responded swiftly and mobilised to the village but that on reaching the community, the attackers had fled the village.\n\nHe said houses were destroyed and some villagers lost their lives during the attack, adding that troops were on the trail of the assailants and details of the pursuit would be made available later.\n\nMajor Takwa further said the Commander OPSH, Maj Gen IS Ali, while commiserating with the families of those who lost their lives during the attack, reiterated his resolve to ensure the perpetrators of evil on the Plateau face the consequences of their dastard acts, the statement added.\n\nAlso, the leadership of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has expressed shock over the unfortunate attack that led to the alleged killings of 18 persons at Ancha village of Bassa LGA.\n\nAccording to a statement signed and issued by the chairman of MACBAN in Plateau State, Muhammad Nuru Abdullahi, while the group condemned the said attack, it, however, frowns at the allegation labelled against Fulani people \u2013 that they carried out the attack which led to the death of 18 people.\n\n\u201cWe see this allegation by the national publicity of Irigwe Development Association, Malison David, as absolute falsehood, that lacks merit and is more of hype than substance,\u201d MACBAN said.\n\nOur correspondent recalls that Irigwe People had accused the Fulani of attacking their villages and killing and burning houses in the process .\n\nThe state governor, Simon Lalong, expressed deep sadness over the attack which left many dead and properties destroyed.\n\nLalong in a statement signed by his director of press and public affairs, Simon Macham, said the attack of Tuesday night was another sad tale in the unending cycle of violent attacks in the area which had continued despite several measures taken by the government to stop them.\n\nHe ordered security agencies to ensure that they fish out the attackers at all costs, as bringing such perpetrators to justice is the only way to halt the barbaric killings.\n\nThe governor asked the GOC 3rd Armoured Division and Commander of Operation Safe Haven, the Commissioner of Police, Department of State Services, Operation Rainbow and other security organs in the state to utilise intelligence available from survivors and other sources and ensure that the perpetrators of this and other attacks are apprehended and exposed.\n\n8,372 Killed, 5,018 Abducted In 2021 \u2013 Report\n\nNon-state actors killed 8,372 Nigerians and abducted 5,018 others across the country between January 01 and December 31, 2021, according to report by Beacon Consulting Limited.\n\nThe report tagged \u2018Nigeria Security Report December 2021\u2019 and obtained by LEADERSHIP said the North suffered the most deaths with 79.2 percent in the period under review, which shows the region is bleeding.\n\nA breakdown of these fatalities, according to the geopolitical regions, shows that the North West suffered the highest with 3,051 deaths, followed by the North East with 1,895 casualties, North Central \u2013 1,684 victims, South East \u2013 853, South-South \u2013 448, and South West \u2013 441.\n\nThe breakdown further shows that 36.4 percent of the yearly fatality figures affected the North West region, 22.6 percent affected the North East and 20.1 percent, North Central, putting the total percentage of fatalities for Northern Nigeria at 79.2%\u201d\n\nThe report shows that 1,516 deaths were recorded across the country in the 4th quarter of 2021 alone.\n\nA breakdown of these deaths according to geopolitical regions shows that the North West suffered the highest with 673, followed by the North East with 413 casualties, North Central with 235 victims, South East with 114, South West with 51 and South-South, 30.\n\n\u201cIn addition, an analysis of the states most affected by the fatalities shows they spread across 31 states and the FCT, with Borno State recording the highest fatalities at 1,508 deaths. Our incident tracker did not record any confirmed fatality associated with the threat elements we monitored in Bauchi, Bayelsa, Ekiti, Jigawa and Kano states,\u201d it said.\n\nThe report indicates that in 2021, 5,018 abductions were recorded across the country.\n\nThe breakdown shows that the North West suffered the highest with 3101 incidents, followed by the North Central with 1082, North East with 276 victims, South-South with 245, South West with 223 and South East, 91.\n\n\u201cThe breakdown further shows that 61.8 percent of the yearly abduction figures affected the North West region, 21.6 percent in the North Central and 5.5 percent in the North East. This puts the total percentage of kidnapping incidents in northern Nigeria for January \u2013 December 2021, at 88.9 percent.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, government efforts led to a consecutive month-to-month reduction of security incidents and fatalities, but not kidnapping as 574 cases, representing a 58 percent month-to-month increase, was recorded in December 2021.\n\nFor the month of December, the firm recorded a diverse range of security incidents and 431 deaths in 29 states across 96 LGAs.\n\nA breakdown of these incidents shows that 26 percent occurred in the North West geopolitical region, 19 percent in North Central, 17 percent in South West, and 13 percent each in South-South and South-East and 12 percent North East.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe thematic indications of the incidents that resulted in these fatalities include mostly armed attacks and a continuation of the trend of several non-state actors successfully challenging the state\u2019s monopoly of the use of force.\u201d\n\nOn North East, the report observed continued armed conflicts between government security forces, codenamed Operation Hadin Kai, and several non-state actors including the Islamist jihadist groups, the Jamatus Ahlis Sunna lil dawatil wal Jihad (Boko Haram) and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), mostly affecting parts of northern Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.\n\nThe report for December 2021 observed attempts by ISWAP to maintain territorial control, including setting up illegal checkpoints on travel routes where they targetted commuters, and an increased interdiction attacks by the security forces with a noticeable improvement in the Nigeria Airforce support and response capabilities, leading to more effective repelling of Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters\u2019 attacks and destruction of their platforms.\n\nThe report further indicates series of clashes between Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters, the use of anti-aircraft weapons, artillery mortar fire and rocket launchers by ISWAP using improvised platforms to effect long-range attacks but with little accuracy in their targeting,\n\nBandits Kidnap More Traders On Kaduna Road\n\nAnother set of traders travelling to Kano from Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, were reportedly abducted by bandits yesterday.\n\nThe bandits were said to have blocked the highway between Birnin Gwari and Kaduna at Unguwar Yako forest where they abducted the traders, whose number is not yet known.\n\nAlthough the spokesperson to Kaduna State Police Command, ASP Muhammad Jailge could not be reached on his phone to confirm the incidence, a source who prefers anonymity said the victims were likely on a business trip and moving from Birnin Gwari axis to Kano before they were kidnapped.\n\nHe said,\u201dWe spotted four empty vehicles and they said an unspecified number of persons moving from Birnin-Gwari axis to Kano have been kidnapped,\u201d he said.\n\nFor several years now, the Birnin-Gwari road has remained a hot spot for kidnappers and bandits who terrorise travellers passing the route.\n\nRecently, bandits have twice kidnapped traders along the same route.\n\nPMB Reiterates Commitment To End Banditry\n\nMeanwhile, responding to the recent killing of scores of Zamfara residents, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday conveyed his condolences and that of his government to the people of the state on what he called the \u201cextremely unfortunate\u201d mass killings of innocent people by retreating bandits.\n\nThe president, who described the recent incident as a very sad one for the nation, reiterated his earlier commitment to tackle the monster of terrorism head-on, giving assurances that the besieged communities and other Nigerians will not be abandoned to their fate.\n\nIn an address to the governor, commissioners, Emirs, the Chief Judge and Grand Khadi, legislators, council chairmen and political leaders, President Buhari, who was represented by a delegation led by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd), expressed the strong determination of the administration to get rid of the bandits who have now been classified as terrorists.\n\n\u201cThere will be no let-up in the ongoing campaign to rid Zamfara and other affected states of the menace of these terrorists. Since they have no regard for the sanctity of life, so shall they be dealt with.\n\n\u201cThe government is fully informed of what is going on and will do whatever it takes to end this (carnage). We are here to talk to the governor and to assure the state that the administration is determined to do more to defend the life and property of the people,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nPresident Buhari condoled with the government and the people of the state over the losses of life and directed the military and other security agencies to intensify the ongoing campaign until everyone and everywhere is safe.\n\nThe governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Bello Matawalle, who welcomed the delegation, said the visit was a testimony to the strong support of the President and the government at the centre.\n\nHe appreciated the wisdom and vision of the president in approving the ongoing military campaign in the state, the effect of which has led to the dismantling of terrorists\u2019 hideouts used as launchpads for kidnapping, rustling and terrorism. He, however, said more still needs to be done.\n\nHe called on the federal government to fortify the security of the state with additional Armored Personnel Carriers, APCs, and to roll out a special intervention fund for Zamfara and other states equally affected by the scourge of insecurity.\n\nSecurity Tops NASS 2022 Agenda\n\nThe Senate president, Ahmad Lawan, has said the National Assembly in 2022 will focus on security through oversight of funds appropriated in this year\u2019s budget to the armed forces and other security agencies.\n\nHe said doing so would guarantee transparency in the procurement process and ensure the welfare of military and security personnel tasked with restoring security across parts of the country.\n\nLawan made these comments yesterday when the Senate Press Corps paid a visit to felicitate with him on the occasion of his 63rd birthday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThat takes me to the challenge for the National Assembly, particularly the Senate in 2022. So far, we have done over ninety percent of what we set for ourselves in our legislative agenda, but because the country and people are dynamic, we have so many other things to do.\n\n\u201cToday, the security situation still begs for more attention. We will give a lot of attention to the security situation. We have appropriated about a trillion for our security agencies and armed forces, now it is for members of the National Assembly to ensure that the procurement process by the armed forces is transparent and everybody there is accountable.\n\n\u201c[And} of course, we should do oversight as much as possible on the welfare of our soldiers and security personnel. They need to continuously be motivated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate president added that the upper chamber would also, in the first-quarter of this year, focus on addressing the challenges of revenue generation, collection and remittance to shore up earnings by the federal government.\n\nHe said Nigerians will remember the Ninth Assembly under his leadership for its outstanding legislative achievements after the end of its lifespan in June 2023.",

Thereafter, the president constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD ALSO : Twitter Suspended Over Fake News, Not Buhari Alone \u2013 Presidency\n\n\u201cSubsequently, in its wisdom, the Presidential Committee set a 20-member Technical Committee comprising all relevant government agencies. The Technical Committee engaged and worked directly with the Twitter team.\n\nAccording to the statement, the immediate and remote cause of the suspension was the unceasing use of the platform by some unscrupulous elements for subversive purposes and criminal activities, propagating fake news, and polarising Nigerians along tribal and religious lines, among others, which bordered on national security and cohesion, adding that the effects of the abuse of the Twitter platform forced the federal government to suspend the operation of Twitter to address the direct and collateral issues around its operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt added that the new global reality was that digital platforms and their operators wield enormous influence over the fabric of society, social interaction and economic choices, hence these platforms can be used as tools or weapons.\n\nThe government said further in the statement that every nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently, noting that without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTherefore, our action is a deliberate attempt to recalibrate our relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for our nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the company. Our engagement has been very respectful, cordial, and successful,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAccording to the NITDA boss, the process of resolving this impasse between the Nigerian government and Twitter Inc. has helped to lay a foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities, adding that Twitter is a platform of choice for many Nigerians ranging from young innovators to public sector officials who find it helpful to engage their audience.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria. Furthermore, the federal government looks forward to providing a conducive environment for Twitter and other global tech companies to achieve their potential and be sustainably profitable in Nigeria,\u201d the statement added.\n\nWhile appreciating all Nigerians, especially the vibrant Nigerian youths who have borne with the long wait to resolve this impasse, the federal government expressed happiness that the gains made from this shared national sacrifice are immeasurable.\n\nSome of the gains, it said, include: Ongoing economic and training opportunities as the company continues to consider expanding its presence in Nigeria; getting a better understanding of how to use the Twitter platform effectively to improve businesses; revenue generation from the operation of Twitter in Nigeria; smooth and coordinated relationship between Nigerian government and Twitter leading to mutual trust.\n\nOthers include reduction of cybercriminal activities such as terrorism, cyberstalking, hate speech, etc.; and working with Twitter and other global companies to build an acceptable code of conduct following global best practices.\n\nThe federal government also urged Twitter to fulfil some conditions before restoring its services, like legal registration of operations, pay taxes, and manage prohibited publication in line with Nigerian laws.\n\nIt added that Twitter had agreed to meet all the conditions set by the federal government and, consequently, the government and Twitter had decided on an execution timeline, which has started this week.\n\n\u201cOur engagement with Twitter opens a new chapter in global digital diplomacy and sets a new operational template for Twitter to come back stronger for the benefit of Nigerians,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAccording to the government, Twitter in the resolutions has committed to establishing a legal entity in Nigeria during the first quarter of 2022. The legal entity will register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The establishment of the entity is Twitter\u2019s first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria.\n\nTwitter has also agreed to appoint a designated country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The Global Public Policy team is also directly available through a dedicated communication channel.\n\n\u201cTwitter has also agreed to comply with applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law. Twitter has agreed to enrol Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals.\n\nThe Partner Support Portal provides a direct channel for government officials and Twitter staff to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules. At the same time, the Law Enforcement Portal provides a channel for the law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian Laws. Taken together, these represent a comprehensive compliance apparatus,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian government, Twitter agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built and work with the federal government and the broader industry to develop a Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the federal government lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13th January, 2022.

          "text": "Following the declaration of national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu and Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi, to contest the 2023 presidential election, other presidential hopefuls have played down being under pressure to publicly declare.\n\nThe aspirants within APC and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) told LEADERSHIP that they were still consulting and weighing the options vis-a-vis the outcome of events in their respective parties.\n\nIn the APC, those expected to declare their intention for the top seat soon are former Vice President Prof Yemi Osinbajo; governor of Ekiti State and chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum, Kayode Fayemi; Business Mogul, Gbenga Olawepo-Hassim, and minister of state for Education, Hon Emeka Nwajiuba.\n\nWhen contacted, a source in Nwajiuba\u2019s camp told LEADERSHIP that the minister is still consulting on the matter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe source who pleaded not to be named as he was not authorized to speak on the minister\u2019s presidential bid said, \u201cThis process requires elaborate consultation. The former Lagos State governor who just declared has clearly done his consultations.\n\n\u201cBut you can be sure that at the appropriate time, the minister will make his intentions known. But for now he is focused on his current assignment. We are also conscious of the times\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: After Tinubu, Umahi Informs Buhari Of Presidential Ambition\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother presidential hopeful on the platform of APC, Senator Rochas Okorocha, said he was not in a rush to formally declare his intention.\n\nSpeaking through his media aide, Sam Onwuemodo, Okorocha said there is no rush to make declarations because other people have.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own programme which they are working with. There is no need to rush because some others have. Let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed and watch what happens. That is what I can say\u201d, Onwuemodo said.\n\nHe refused to give an insight into their plans, saying events will unfold.\n\nOkorocha had last week Wednesday while reacting to the failure of Governor Hope Uzodimma to name sponsors of criminality in Imo State, said he would contest the presidency of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said Uzodimma was against him because of his presidential ambition.\n\nHowever, former presidential candidate in 2019 and business mogul, Olawepo-Hassim, will declare his ambition after the national convention.\n\nAn authoritative source within his camp said the presidential hopeful will make his ambition known after the APC national convention.\n\nThe source said, \u201cBy the Grace of God after the APC national convention.\u201d\n\nIn the PDP, the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is expected to formally declare his intention in the first quarter of this year.\n\nHowever, a top source in former Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki\u2019s camp dismissed claims that Saraki had declared for the seat last November during his visit to the governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, in Makurdi.\n\nThe source said the former Senate president is yet to make a formal declaration, explaining that what happened in Makurdi wasn\u2019t a formal declaration.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere was no declaration when Dr. Saraki met Governor Ortom. He only went to consult the governor on his ambition and the governor said he had scheduled a meeting of party leaders who were already waiting for him.\n\n\u201cHe then said Dr. Saraki should accompany him to the meeting so that he can tell the party leaders in Benue why he came to see him. That actually is not the way a man of Dr. Saraki\u2019s calibre will declare presidential ambition. When it is time to formally declare his ambition, everybody in the country will know\u201d.\n\nSo far, those who have formally declared their intention formally are Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa and former Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nMeanwhile, former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof Kingsley Moghalu, was the first to openly declare his presidential ambition.\n\nThe 2019 presidential candidate of Young Peoples Party (YPP) has since pitched his political tent with the African Democratic Congress (ADC) ahead of the 2023 contest.",

          "text": "By Shuaib Sadiq\n\nThe National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Sen. Bola Tinubu, on Thursday, announced a donation of N50 million to Zamfara communities recently attacked by bandits.\n\nTinubu announced the donation shortly after he commiserated with Gov. Bello Matawalle in Gusau, Zamfara.\n\nThe APC national leader called for sustained prayers to overcome the insecurity situation in the state.\n\n\u201cI could offer prayers for the people from anywhere, but coming in person is important.\n\n\u201cThe enemies of knowledge, Boko Haram and other criminal elements will be defeated through commitment in humanity.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the entire country to be stable and if the enemies refuse to stop the carnage, we shall eliminate them.\n\n\u201cWe believe in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s ability to restore law and order and bring back our country to stability and tracks of development,\u201d Tinubu said.\n\nHe was accompanied on the visit to Gusau by Sen. Kashim Shettima, former Borno governor, the former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), Malam Nuhu Ribadu and former APC National Vice Chairman, South-west, Chief Pius Akinyelure.\n\nGov. Bello Matawalle, who received the APC leader, said that his visit would further console the bereaved communities and the entire people of the state.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure to welcome His Excellency, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Jagaban Borgu, who has spared time out of his tight commitments to visit the state to commiserate with our people over the recent tragic incident of banditry attacks in some communities of Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas,\u201d Matawalle said\n\nHe described the Jagaban Borgu as a doyen of contemporary Nigerian politics, a dedicated leader, and a bridge-builder.\n\nSimilarly, he cited him as someone who had spent the past 23 years of the nation\u2019s democracy fostering unity, nurturing, and raising individuals who had equally distinguished themselves in various spheres of human endeavour in contemporary Nigeria.\n\nThe governor noted that the problem of banditry in the state had persisted for over a decade.\n\n\u201cWhen I assumed office in 2019, I made it my utmost priority to address this issue as no meaningful development could be accomplished in an atmosphere of insecurity.\n\n\u201cConsidering the reality that the conflict is tied to ethnic fault lines, I initiated a dialogue and reconciliation programme, which leaders of thought overwhelmingly accepted all over the state.\n\n\u201cAs a result of our programme of dialogue and reconciliation, hostilities ceased for a period of over nine months.\n\n\u201cHundreds of kidnapped persons were unconditionally released by their captors,\u201d Matawalle said.\n\nHe explained that as the disarmament process progressed; the glorious era of brotherly love, and mutual coexistence among segments of the Zamfara communities returned.\n\nAccording to him, for the first time in more than a decade, the annual Fulani festival of \u2018Sharu\u2019 was held in Gusau in 2019.\n\nHe, however, expressed sadness that the achievement became bad news for some \u201cself-serving politicians in the state.\n\n\u201cThey, therefore, perfected plans to sabotage the peace process. In some cases, security reports fingered them as having direct involvement in the planning and execution of kidnapping, ostensibly to embarrass the government.\n\n\u201cFor instance, based on the figures confirmed by the affected community leaders when I visited the communities after the recent attacks, a total of 58 people lost their lives in contrast to the outrageous figures being published in the media,\u201d he stated.\n\nMatawalle said that his government had in addition to the dialogue, committed enormous resources in the provision of logistics and allowances for security forces deployed to the state.\n\nIn 2019 alone, he said that his government procured and distributed 200 brand new Hilux pickups for the security forces in the state.\n\nThe governor added that his administration would continue to do everything within its power to bring an end to the menace of banditry in the state.\n\n\u201cAs we get closer to 2023 general elections, we will be more vigilant and proactive, knowing that these destabilising forces are not likely to tone down their antics.\n\n\u201cThey may continue to plot nefarious schemes in order to obtain political gains,\u201d Matawalle said.\n\nHe thanked the APC leader for taking time out to visit and commiserate with the government and people of the state.\n\n\u201cMay Allah richly reward you and fulfil your desire of building a strong bond among Nigerians across all the divides.\n\n\u201d(NAN)",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Osinbajo, Tinubu\u2019s supporters differ, N/central lawmakers back Bello",
          "text": "With lobbying and high level politicking ahead of 2023 general elections, supporters of both Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu have continued to push for the presidential bids of their preferred candidates.\n\nWhile Tinubu has announced his intention to vie for the nation\u2019s plum seat, Osinbajo, a commissioner under Tinubu when the latter was governor in Lagos state, is yet to make public his speculated bid amidst continuous drumming of support for his candidature by some lobby groups.\n\nDuring a recent visit to President Muhammdu Buhari, Tinubu reportedly told the president of his intention to lead the country, a wish he said, had been his lifelong dream.\n\nAlso, Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, though yet to publicly intimate the president of his ambition, has continued to use every available space to sell his candidature, just as he receives various groups believed to be supporting his cause.\n\nThe latest of such groups were North-central lawmakers who are backing his candidature for the nation\u2019s top job.\n\nTinubu supporters\n\nNotwithstanding the speculated ambition of the vice president, a pro-Tinubu group told Osinbajo to shelve his ambition if any, and yield the ticket to his benefactor and former governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Tinubu.\n\nAddressing a press conference Thursday in Abuja, the Tinubu Support Groups (TSG) reminded Osinbajo not to forget that he has been a core member of the Tinubu political family all his life.\n\nChairman of the FCT chapter of TSG and former member House of Representatives in the territory, Hon. Zaphaniah Jisalo, who spoke on behalf of the group, warned supporters of both political leaders not to create tension in their camps.\n\nHe said Osinbajo\u2019s rumoured ambition would be sorted out within the political family.\n\nJisalo said: \u201cThe issue in question no one can answer it. But I know and believe that Osinbajo knows what he is doing. I believe he knows who his mentor is, and whatever anybody is thinking or hearing, or trying to ask Osinbajo to contest against his mentor, I don\u2019t think it is realistic. So, we will wait and see it. And we also have responsibility to make sure that such does not happen.\n\n\u201cYou know the contest is open. And we are not afraid of whoever is going to contest against Asiwaju but I am saying being an experienced politician, respect is expected on who it is due.\u201d\n\nJisalo, however, thanked the former Lagos governor for heeding to their calls on him to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe are here this morning to appreciate God and to also appreciate the party, APC particularly and personally, to appreciate our mentor Asiwaju Tinubu for accepting our demands that we want him to be the person that will take over from President Muhammadu Buhari 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have seen him as a man of integrity. We see him as a man who likes justice. We see in him a man who wants to carry all Nigerians to the promise land. And that is why this morning we are here again to thank him for his declaration and for accepting the demands that he will contest the presidential election.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, we are convinced that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the only man who will rule this country in 2023.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the FCT secretary of TSG, Hon. Patrick Oduyemi, said: \u201cYou see, Professor Osinbajo is a part of Bola Ahmed Tinubu family. And I can assure you that it is a family matter which will be sorted out at the family level. So, I don\u2019t want anybody to dabble into it such that they will create the sort of tension between Tinubu and the Vice President. So, let us leave it as it is because it will be sorted out at the appointed time.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo group\n\nAlso making a case for Osinbajo, Identify the Right Leaders\u2019 Initiative (IRLI) said the APC would be missing it if it decides not to give the party\u2019s ticket to the vice president in next year\u2019s contest.\n\nIn a statement made available to Blueprint Thursday in Abuja, the civic group said at this critical time of its history, Nigeria needed a \u201cyounger, competent, and cerebral candidates to fly the flags of the leading parties for the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Dr Abimbola Oyarinu, said: \u201cSome analysts have also noted that in addition to age, emphasis on who becomes the nation\u2019s next president must have demonstrated competence and excellence in their discharge of previous tasks.\n\n\u201cIn a nation whose over 60 per cent of its population are young people, political observers are unanimous in their views that there is need for dynamism in the country\u2019s next leadership.\n\n\u201cIRLI\u2019s says it was formed to lead Nigerians in identifying the right leaders for critical public positions by looking at their pedigree, character, and competence.\n\n\u201cRecent developments in the polity from Twitter ban, EndSARS, and the continuous clamour for Electoral Reforms have made Nigerians become more interested in the forthcoming elections.\u201d\n\nThe group further said it was taking such definite stance because every Nigerian should be concerned with the democratic process.\n\n\u201cFor over three decades, it\u2019s been the same unproductive cycle of leaders presiding over the likes that this nation does not belong to all of us. It is time for all Nigerians to stand up and be counted. There should no longer be onlookers at this point,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement further said \u201cProfessor Osinbajo has been largely celebrates because his contributions and work ethic have inspired most Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe civic group, in their recent Impact Assessment Report(IAR) of the actions, policies and programmes,\u201d Osinbajo has undertaken since his stint as Attorney-General of Lagos state in 1999, confirmed that Osinbajo is the most active, visible and impactful Vice President and perhaps the best since 1979 in the position.\n\n\u201cIt believes that if Osinbajo is empowered and becomes the substantive president, Nigeria will be better for it.\u201d\n\nThe report says Osinbajo, at every opportunity he had as Acting President \u2013 \u201chas done so more than three times since 2015 \u2013 Osinbajo has taken landmark decisions to better the lives of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, Osinbajo as Acting President signed Executive Order 001: Promotion of Efficiency and Transparency in Business Environments.\n\n\u201cAnalysts have hailed the Order as one that became necessary in curbing \u201csharp practices, corruption, and unethical behaviour in the Nigerian business climate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians will recall that after some Directorate of State Security (DSS) operatives invaded the National Assembly in 2018, Osinbajo terminated the appointment of Lawal Daura, the DSS boss at the time. This highly celebrated decision came at the time when other politicians would have been more concerned about its political consequences rather than the nation\u2019s collective interests. Our [impact assessment] report says such decisions demonstrate that Osinbajo places national interests over party or election considerations.\n\n\u201cDuring the 2020 #EndSARS protests, it was Osinbajo who summoned the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to the Villa on which the decision and announcement of final disbandment of SARS were taken. Osinbajo deployed the National Economic Council (NEC) to convince state governors \u2013 who form the core of NEC \u2013 that police brutality was an economic issue and should be discussed under the NEC Agenda. The Osinbajo-led NEC directed governors to set up Judicial Panels of Inquiry to investigate cases of police brutalities in their domains. As part of the demands of the protesters, NEC directed the states to set up Victims Support Funds (VSF) to ensure they get justice,\u201d Oyarinu further said.\n\nThe statement warned the APC against selling its presidential ticket to the owners of ill-gotten wealth in the forthcoming convention as that may spell doom for it.\n\n\u201cNigerians are now more politically aware. The endSARS protests have opened the eyes of most people and on the importance of the need to become active in the democratic process. The APC will be making a huge mistake to underestimate how politically aware most Nigerians are now. Anything less than Osinbajo means the APC is heading for the iceberg.\u201d IRIL said.\n\nThey said: \u201cWhat the APC needs to do is just unite behind him to give him the much-needed support and he will arrive safely in Aso Rock in 2023 on the back of his intimidating credentials both in public and private life. Osinbajo comes as a soft sell for the party. In a sane society, Osinbajo should have the right of first refusal in the presidential ticket if we are to be serious.\n\n\u201cIf being hardworking, proactive and decisive are the essential requirements of becoming president, Professor Osinbajo has demonstrated these effortlessly.\u201d\n\nBased on the findings of the assessment report, the statement added, Osinbajo has distinguished himself by visiting project sites and crisis spots and matching policies with actions.\n\nGov Bello gets boost\n\nMeanwhile, state legislators in all the North Central states have passed a vote of confidence on Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC.\n\nThe legislators also endorsed Kogi state Governor Bello for the 2023 presidency as the only one that had so far demonstrated intention to vie for the nation\u2019s top seat in 2023.\n\nThey spoke with one voice at the end of a one-day extraordinary meeting of the APC state legislature from the six states of the North Central Zone, held in Abuja Thursday.\n\nThey encouraged Governor Bello to continue to pursue his ambition, saying he remained the only person that the zone could rally round \u201cfor it to be counted in the power equation of the country.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers also said the Buni-led committee needed the support and cooperation of all party faithful to reposition the APC for better performance and victory in the 2023 polls.\n\nAccording to the convener, the immediate past Speaker of the Niger State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Ahmed Marafa, the extraordinary meeting was convened to discuss the political future of the zone with respect to what he called the power equation in the country.\n\nHe urged members from the six states of the zone to see reason why all well-meaning men and women must come together and agitate for a fair share for the zone.\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker Kogi State House of Assembly Matthew Kolawole commended the lawmakers for their positive consideration of Governor Bello, noting that it would go a long way to showing their genuine efforts to look after the welfare of their people.\n\nHe said since 1960, the zone had been marginalised and neglected in the democratically elected leadership map of the country despite the endowed human resources in the area, noting that it was time for all and sundry, irrespective of party affiliations, to rise up and join hands to agitate for a North Central presidency come 2023.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their one-day roundtable, the legislators appealed to all party faithful at all levels to give their support and cooperation to Governor Buni \u201cto complete the good work that had led many people into the party since he assumed office.\u201d\n\nThey also called on all the leaders in North-Central to continue to pursue the North-Central presidency without prejudice to their personal aspiration, pointing out that the number one position in the country would be more beneficial to the zone and the nation at large.\n\nPresent at the meeting were speakers of Nasarawa and Plateau states, Rt. Hon. Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi and Rt. Hon.Yakubu Yakson Sanda respectively, while Deputy Speaker of Kwara state, Rt. Hon. Raphael Adetiba and Minority Leader of Benue State House of Assembly among others.\n\nMomodu, Ohuabunwa seek PDP ticket\n\nIn a related development, the national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyiorchia Ayu has assured two presidential aspirants-Chief Dele Momodu and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa-of a level playing ground.\n\nHe gave the assurance Thursday when the duo visited him in Abuja.\n\nAfter receiving letter of intent from Momodu, the national chairman assured that the party\u2019s presidential primary election would be free, fair and credible.\n\n\u201cThere will be a level playing field for all candidates. We don\u2019t have any special candidate; we don\u2019t have a preferred candidate. It is the party members who will decide and if at the end of the day, the party members vote for you that you are the one they want, we will queue behind you,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nHe charged the aspirants to work hard to build the party, noting that nobody can help the party other than themselves.\n\nPresenting a letter containing his intention, Momodu, a journalist, publisher and businessman from Edo state, said his mission in the 2023 race was to seek to correct the many wrongs in the socio-political life of the nation, adding that Nigeria needed redirection.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe time has come for full reconciliation and forgiveness and a closure of our ugly past. Nigeria urgently requires a reset and a total redirection. I\u2019m convinced that the time has come to seriously challenge and dislodge those politicians who have held our country to ransom by kidnapping, hijacking and destroying the future of our younger generation and generations yet unborn.\n\n\u201cNigeria deserves much better than where we are now, and my appeal to fellow Nigerians is that we should collectively rescue our dear country from the suffocating claws of slave masters, overlords and tyrants, vociferously and vehemently reject any suggestion that Nigeria should continue to tread this dangerous path.\n\n\u201cThe die cast, and we must regain and take back our country! fully and unequivocally commit and dedicate myself to this cause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better prepared now than at the time of my first foray into the fray in 2011, and I am fully ready and certainly capable for the onerous tasks and responsibilities ahead.\n\n\u201cAfter due consultations with my family, friends and some stakeholders, I have arrived at the decision to contest the 2023 Presidential election on the platform of our great party, PDP. if selected as the Party\u2019s candidate I hasten to add that this is my personal decision, although I have received advice, encouragement and support from diverse quarters since I started my consultations.\n\n\u201cI therefore offer myself to the PDP as the best aspirant to turn the fortunes of our esteemed party and our well endowed country around. In this regard, and with a deep sense of humility and profound respect\u201d, he said.\n\nMomodu, who urged the party not to consider picking its candidate based on the usual considerations, added, \u201cthe mood of the teeming youths, and indeed every patriotic Nigerian, who we need to come out en masse to vote for our party, aligns with this view.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, that I invite our great party, PDP, to accept that it must search for a veritable flag bearer with the requisite leadership and visionary qualities that Nigerians now earnestly yearn for.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Mazi Ohuabunwa said he wanted to be president \u201cto lay the foundation for proper unity of the nation to create a level playing ground where every child born in every part of this country will have the same opportunity like the other child to achieve his potential the way it happens the United States of America\u201d.\n\nOhuabunwa who debunked the insinuation that he may be too old for the top job stated that \u201cit is the experience you need to run a country, not necessarily chronological age. So understand what one young people are, I am young, in my heart, in my spirit, in my physique and my ability to do the job.\n\n\u201cTo be able to discharge the function of office as a president or governor, you need to have a healthy body. You need to have a healthy soul. You need to have a healthy spirit, body, mind and soul must be together to be able to function in this office.\n\n\u201cThis office of president is a serious office. You must have experienced in managing many things at the same time. It\u2019s not to take six months to forming your cabinet, take six months to plan how you\u2019re going to work. I have the experience I\u2019ve been trained. I may belong to the older group but my Spirit, my heart is of a young person, and I understand how to motivate people to achieve.\u201d",

          "text": "Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha has inaugurated the 23-member governing board of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), with a charge to members to put in their best to combat the hydra-headed monster called corruption.\n\nHe also said financial crimes were hurting the country\u2019s image globally and robbing it of foreign direct investments.\n\nSGF Mustapha, who spoke Thursday in Abuja, said: \u201cThe unfortunate thing is that what we have battled with this internally and in-country, we have successfully exported it out of this country.\n\n\u201cSo, your job and your role would extend beyond the borders of this nation. Because it does hurt our image as a country, it has deprived us of even direct foreign investment.\n\n\u201cIt has created a doubt as to the sincerity of people doing business with us, outside the shores of our country, so we must do everything and you are the ones that are pivoted, assigned the responsibility of creating a new image for Nigeria, and your actions and activities will in no small measure help Nigeria redeem its image.\u201d\n\nThe SGF stressed the need for members of the board to ensure economic and financial crimes were tackled head on.\n\nMustapha said: \u201cYou are, however, required to put in your best to combat financial and economic crimes in the country. The Commission is empowered to prevent, investigate, prosecute and penalise economic and financial crimes and is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the provisions of other laws and regulations relating to economic and financial crimes, as well as fight terrorism.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate the fact that Governing Boards are creations of the enabling statutes of the various institutions, with the main responsibility for giving policy direction to Management, in order to contribute towards the developmental goals of Government. This presupposes that the Management should be allowed to execute its day-to-day activities without undue interference by the Boards.\n\n\u201cI therefore, expect that all hands will be on deck to generate robust policy initiatives that will help this administration achieve its fight against corruption and revamp the economy. Similarly, in carrying out your responsibility as Board Members, you must also eschew corruption totally as Government will not hesitate to sanction all infractions.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, chairman of EFCC boss, Mr Abdulrashid Bawa, said the absence of the board for six years had negatively impacted the commission\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC has been without board for six years sequel to a series of events that had happened which warranted the non-existence of the board. So, it is something that gladdens the heart, with me, of course, being a former staff of the EFCC, and now chairman of the EFCC, that today the EFCC is having a board spearheading the policy direction of this problem that we have, the economic and financial crimes in this country.\n\n\u201cAs you have said, Your Excellency, we have a saying at the EFCC that we have one of the most cosmopolitan boards, looking at public service in this country, looking at the composition of the fact that all law enforcement, and security organizations in this country are represented on the board as well as other regulatory agencies like NICOMSAT as well as Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re happy for this day. And I want to assure Your Excellency and the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, that we\u2019re not unfamiliar with the daunting task before us. We have been doing well. Last year, had been a difficult year with COVID-19. But the EFCC has managed to set a new record in terms of recoveries as well as, you know, convictions.\n\n\u201cLast year alone, Your Excellency we recorded 2,220 convictions, which is the highest ever recorded within one calendar year by the EFCC. The closest to that was in 2019 when the EFCC recorded only 1,280 convictions. Looking at also the figure that we have lost within the same calendar, we lost 37 cases. And we won 2,220.\n\n\u201cIf you do the maths, Your Excellency, you will understand that we had 98.54% success rate in court. But with the inauguration of this board, I believe with the wealth of experience that all of us are bringing to the board, we will be able to do better,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers of the board include Luqman Muhammad, Anumba Adaeze, Alhaji Kola Raheem Adesina, Alhaji Yahaya Muhammad, Haruna Nuhu Koko (State Security Service), Reginald Chukwudi Karawusa (Security and Exchange Commission), Pius Agboola (National Insurance Commission), Salisu Abdu (Nigeria Communications Commission), Nwakaego Celine Nwajei (Nigerian Postal Service), Justine B, Nidiya (Corporate Affairs Commission), U. G Mohammed (Nigeria Custom Services), Muhammed Aminu Muhammed (Nigeria Immigration Service), Umar Maman Sanda (Nigeria Police Force), Emmanuel Andrew Naman (National Intelligence Agency) and Ibrahim Abdul (National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency).\n\nOthers are Gabriel Christopher (Federal Ministry of Finance), Adamu Shaibu (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Jeremiah Abue (Central Bank of Nigeria), Galadima Yusufari Gana (Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation), Justice George Abang Ekpungu (Ministry of Justice) and the Secretary to the Commission.",

We are not Biafra.\n\n\u201cWe have been so oppressed and now we are finding our feet and you want us to go back. We will not. We will not,\u201d the governor declared.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dele Momodu Declares Intention To Run For President\n\nSpeaking on his 2023 presidential ambition, the governor allayed fears making the rounds suggesting that any southeasterner who emerges president might split the nation.\n\nHe argued that Igbos have investment everywhere across the country, saying it would be impossible to think of secession when in power.\n\n\u201cSome enemies of the South-East say if we become president we will divide the country. How will we divide the country when we have investments everywhere?\u201d the governor questioned.\n\nReaffirming his stand regarding the Biafra push, Umahi stated that \u201canyone that wants to cause insecurity in the South-East must be crushed\u201d.\n\nAccording to the governor, Ebonyi State is better in a fair and equitable Nigeria because the state has investments everywhere and one cannot set fire to his own house.\n\nHe vowed that if he becomes president, he will further the projects of President Buhari and will fight the corruption in Nigeria to a standstill.\n\nThe governor was resolute that it is time to build a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat we did in Ebonyi State, we can replicate in Nigeria.

          "text": "\ufeff \ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Thursday inaugurated five key projects in Ogun State, assuring Nigerians that two major Federal roads under construction, the Sagamu-Benin Expressway and the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, would be commissioned before the end of 2022.\n\nAddressing residents of the State, the President heaped praises on Governor Dapo Abiodun, for delivering visionary and trail-blazing projects for the people, even in the midst of prevailing and challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to a statement by his special media aide, Femi Adesina, the president described Abiodun as the \u2018\u2018performing Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State,\u2019\u2019.\n\nPresident Buhari added that the governor is a worthy example of \u2018\u2018promises made, promises kept.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead Also: \u2018We Are Deeply Committed To Nigeria,\u2019 Twitter Reacts To FG\u2019s Suspension Lift\n\nThe President noted that the lofty projects: the Gateway City Gate; the 42-Kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road; the 14km Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway and two Housing Estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta, respectively, could not have materialised without the State government\u2019s huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\n\n\u2018\u2018This has made Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful States in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice.\n\n\u2018\u2018You (Prince Abiodun) have justified the mandate of the people of Ogun State. You have represented our Party very well,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nThe President expressed delight that the 14km Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road commissioned by him has been reconstructed into a modern expressway by the State government.\n\nHe noted that the impressive road would complement the Sagamu-Benin Expressway that the Federal Government is currently reconstructing; also due for commissioning this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018Just across the road is the 42-kilometer Sagamu-Interchange-Abeokuta Road which the state Government has reconstructed and equipped with street lights.\n\n\u2018\u2018That road enjoys a direct linkage with the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway that the Federal Government is rebuilding and due for completion later this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am particularly impressed by the quality and standard of your road projects, and the creative way you have deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the States and Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2018These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital to Kano, with Ogun State having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the housing programme of the Ogun Governor, the President commended its inclusiveness, saying it is equally heart-warming that it cuts across different social strata, capturing the low, medium and high income earners.\n\nAdmiring the Gateway City Gate Project, the Nigerian leader said \u2018\u2018it is not just a Park beautification project. It depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State, a welcoming entrance into the State Capital at the centre point of the State.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that the project is also an ICON depicting the joining of hands for building the future of Ogun State in togetherness.\n\n\u2018\u2018Your Excellency, well done! I am proud of what you have done for your State and your people.\n\n\u2018\u2018You have made our great Party, the APC, proud too. You are a worthy example of promises made, promises kept.\n\n\u2018\u2018These lofty projects could not have materialised without your huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\u2019\u2019\n\nResponding to requests by the State governor to give priority to the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko Roads respectively, the President assured the people of Ogun State that these roads will receive Federal Government attention.\n\nThe President announced that the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of these roads, as done for the 100km Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road.\n\nSimilarly, the President promised to consider the approval of the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo Road by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the tax credit scheme.\n\nThe President thanked the residents of the State for the warm reception accorded him and his entourage in the Gateway State, which is his first visit to any State in the New Year.\n\n\u2018\u2018This welcome by the large crowd brings back the nostalgia of my first arrival on this soil as a young infantry officer in the Nigerian Army at the then Lafenwa Barracks in Abeokuta, not long after independence.\n\n\u2018\u2018The traditional hospitality of the people of this State has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u201cOmowale\u201d and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters whose goodwill I have always enjoyed. Thank you.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President also congratulated the people of Ogun State for having such a focused, deliberate and inclusive Administration under the watch of Prince Abiodun, urging them to continue to support the governor for the successful implementation of the \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda of his Administration.\n\n\u2018\u2018The reward for success is more hardwork to meet the increasing expectations of the people.\n\n\u2018\u2018When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President, who was bestowed with \u201chonourary indigeneship\u201d of the State, said: \u201cIt is also with a sense of responsibility that I receive and cherish the honourary indigeneship bestowed on me as symbolised by the presentation of the key to the Gateway State by Governor Abiodun.\n\n\u201cI will leave Ogun State with fond memories and look forward to enjoying the privilege of my honourary indigeneship.\u201d",

          "text": "Boris Johnson is facing calls from senior Tories to resign after he admitted attending a drinks party during lockdown.\n\nThe prime minister apologised for the way he handled the event in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 and said he understood the public\u2019s \u201crage\u201d over it.\n\nCabinet members including deputy PM Dominic Raab rallied round Mr Johnson.\n\nBut Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and MPs William Wragg, Caroline Nokes and Roger urged him to go.\n\nMr Ross, an MP and a Member of the Scottish Parliament, said he had had a \u201cdifficult conversation\u201d with Mr Johnson after he apologised on Wednesday in the House of Commons.\n\nHe said he would write to the 1922 Committee, which organises Conservative leadership contests, to register his lack of confidence in the prime minister.\n\n\u201cHe is the prime minister. It is his government that put these rules in place, and he has to be held to account for his actions,\u201d Mr Ross said.\n\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said those calling for Mr Johnson were \u201cpeople who are always unhappy\u201d and dismissed Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross as \u201cquite a lightweight figure\u201d.\n\nConservative MP Andrew Percy criticised Mr Rees-Mogg, saying: \u201cAs someone who apparently loves the Union, his personal attack on Douglas\u2026 is a gift to the petty nationalists in the SNP who want to break this country up.\u201d\n\nA minimum of 54 Conservative MPs must send letters to the committee in order to trigger a leadership challenge.\n\nThe drinks gathering, held on 20 May 2020 and described in the invitation as \u201csocially distanced\u201d, was attended by around 30 people, who were invited to bring their own alcohol. Food, including sausage rolls and crisps, was reportedly laid out on trestle tables,\n\nMr Johnson admitted at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday that he had joined colleagues at the event for around 25 minutes to \u201cthank groups of staff\u201d for their hard work during the pandemic, but had \u201cbelieved implicitly that this was a work event\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWith hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside. I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that \u2013 even if it could have been said technically to fall within the guidance \u2013 there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way.\u201d\n\nMinisters have urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray into alleged Covid-rule breaking at Downing Street parties, which is expected be published next week.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told BBC Breakfast: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let these investigations get to the full details and the full facts.\u201d\n\nHe said the prime minister recognised the \u201cfrustration, anger and upset\u201d about what people perceived to be happening at Downing Street, adding he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supported his leadership.\n\nBut Mr Wragg, a backbench MP who chairs an influential select committee, called the prime minister\u2019s position \u201cuntenable\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme.\n\nAnd fellow Tory Caroline Nokes, who chairs another Commons committee, said the prime minister should resign now as he was \u201cdamaging the entire Conservative brand\u201d.\n\nThe former minister, who has previously been critical of Mr Johnson\u2019s leadership, told ITV\u2019s Robert Peston: \u201cRegretfully, he looks like a liability. And I think he either goes now, or he goes in three years\u2019 time at a general election.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s admission and apology in the Commons likely bought him a little time.\n\nA pause until the official inquiry into what parties did or didn\u2019t take place in Downing Street is published, in perhaps a week or so.\n\nBut for many on his own side, Boris Johnson has already lost the benefit of the doubt.\n\nGrowing numbers of his own MPs want him out, discussing frantically how and when his exit could take place.\n\nAt Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson\u2019s explanation for his attendance at the drinks gathering was \u201cso ridiculous that it\u2019s actually offensive to the British public\u201d and he called on Mr Johnson \u201cto do the decent thing and resign\u201d.\n\nThe SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on Tory MPs to force the prime minister out.\n\nAnd Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who has asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate Mr Johnson\u2019s attendance at the drinks, said he had to go.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s statement was met with a mixed reaction from Conservative MPs, with Dan Poulter saying it was \u201cnot much consolation\u201d for those who had worked on the frontline in the NHS.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss and Chancellor Rishi Sunak \u2013 both tipped as potential successors to Mr Johnson as leader \u2013 tweeted their support on Wednesday evening.\n\nMs Truss said she stood behind the prime minister \u201c100%\u201d, while Mr Sunak said Mr Johnson had been \u201cright to apologise\u201d, adding that he supported the PM\u2019s call for \u201cpatience\u201d while Ms Gray completed her investigation.\n\nA poll for The Times by YouGov, carried out before Mr Johnson\u2019s apology at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, gave Labour at a 10-point lead over the Conservatives \u2013 the party\u2019s biggest lead since December 2013.\n\nThe government is facing mounting pressure over several events that are alleged to have been held during lockdowns in 2020. Here is what we know about them and the restrictions in place at the time:\n\n10 May 2020\n\nBoris Johnson announced a plan to take the \u201cfirst careful steps\u201d out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to \u201cobey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them\u201d.\n\nLegal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising.\n\n15 May 2020\n\nA photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, \u201cthose people were at work talking about work\u201d.\n\n20 May 2020\n\nAbout 100 people were invited by email to \u201csocially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden\u201d on behalf of the prime minister\u2019s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.\n\nWitnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended.\n\nBoris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and \u201cbelieved implicitly that this was a work event\u201d.\n\n17 July 2020\n\nBoris Johnson announced plans for a \u201csignificant return to normality\u201d in England by Christmas \u201cthrough targeted, local action\u201d instead of national lockdowns.\n\nBut he added that the timetable relied on \u201cevery one of us staying alert and acting responsibly\u201d.\n\n5 November 2020\n\nWith cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that \u201cwe are once again asking you to stay at home\u201d as a new national lockdown began.\n\nHe said people should only leave their homes \u201cfor work if you can\u2019t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies\u201d. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes.\n\n13 November 2020\n\nSources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place.\n\n27 November 2020\n\nA leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources.\n\n2 December 2020\n\nThe second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with \u201ctough tiers to keep this virus down\u201d.\n\nLondon was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for work purposes.\n\n10 December 2020\n\nThe Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited.\n\n14 December 2020\n\nThe Conservative Party has admitted that an \u201cunauthorised gathering\u201d took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party\u2019s London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party.\n\n15 December 2020\n\nMultiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo \u2013 published by the Sunday Mirror \u2013 showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n16 December 2020\n\nLondon moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important \u201ceveryone is cautious\u201d ahead of the festive period.\n\nThe Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it \u201cinappropriate\u201d and an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d by staff.\n\n18 December 2020\n\nDowning Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street.\n\nHowever, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister\u2019s then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: \u201cThis fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.\u201d\n\nBBC",
