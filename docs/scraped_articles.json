          "title": "Ban on open grazing: MACBAN backs govs",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ibrahim HassanWuyo\n\nThe National Patron of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN ,Senator Walid Jibrin, has said that a ban on open grazing will help to address farmers -herders crisis in the country.\n\nHe, therefore, commended the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum for placing a ban on open grazing and called on Fulani organizations to unite as one.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Kaduna yesterday, Senator Jibrin ,\n\nthe Sarkin Fulani Nasarawa, said \u201cmost importantly, the various Fulani associations with membership up to 50 must come together and talk with one voice on this tradition of open grazing and not necessarily allow any group to come out to do it for them\u201d\n\nAccording to him, cattle rearing has been on in Africa for over 100 years without any consideration to free movement of cattle (open grazing) or any grazing reserve.\n\n\u201cThis was so because at that time, there were few herders, farmers and cattle, especially in Nigeria. Today, the population of both has increased, with modern technique of farming consuming land tremendously,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that with the current international concern on cattle rearing in Africa, especially Nigeria, there was need to look at how best this practice will be carried out successfully. He said:\u201cWe must note that land in Nigeria is owned by individuals, federal, and state governments.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a full-blooded Fulani man, Sarkin Fulani, and Patron, Miyatti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN, and concerned Fulani leader in Nigeria, I have a free mind on anyone recommending a ban on open grazing, free movement of herders, and cattle in Nigeria because the practice is getting outdated internationally and , therefore necessary, for Nigeria, especially the Fulani race, to study critically the traditional open grazing ,believing that the 21st century may never accommodate it.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the practice of open grazing in Nigeria, compared with what is happening internationally, Nigeria can never continue with traditional open grazing practice. \u2018\u2019In order to effect a change, Fulani elite should be bold enough to come out with alternatives to open grazing and advise the Fulanis in Nigeria accordingly.\n\n\u201cFederal and state governments should come to the rescue by providing grazing reserves, equipped with hospitals, nomadic schools, electricity, bore holes, cattle markets with modern slaughtering centres, open market to our Fulani women to enable them remain in one place to sell milk, instead of their house-to-house roaming about exposing our rich culture and religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fully observed the feeling of many groups and individuals in Nigeria about open grazing. There is so much condemnation from Nigerian governors, Northern governors, Southern governors etc.\n\n\u2018\u2019These groups and individuals should never be condemned and must be praised for their bold comments trying to modernize and improve cattle rearing in Nigeria. Another reason we should shy away from open grazing is the way old methods of settlements of crises between herdsmen and farmers have been abandoned.\n\n\u201cThe role of the traditional rulers, especially the village heads, district heads are daily being neglected by both herdsmen and farmers, leaving it in the hands of the Police, courts and other law enforcement agencies agencies.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u2018\u2019Because of poverty and lack of full education, some Fulani children are involved in some unholy acts which will surely be remedied by provision of grazing reserves.\n\n\u2018May I seize this opportunity to congratulate all the governors for the bold steps they are taking to solve the menace of open grazing, kidnapping and banditry. In the South West, the recent action by the governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, is very commendable.\n\n\u2018\u2019I also commend him for shying away from the call asking all Hausas and Fulanis to leave the South West. I also condemn any call from the North that all Hausas and Fulani should leave the South West.\n\n\u201cNigeria must remain one entity, against what is happening now. We should rely more on dialogue, and mediation with herders, Fulani leaders, traditional rulers and our governors in order to end this feud.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our traditional rulers must also be encouraged to participate in dialogue between Fulani herdsmen and farmers. For now, traditional rulers should be kept off from handling of herdsmen and farmers problems.\n\n\u201cOf course, our traditional rulers must be given a proper role in the Nigerian constitution. May I strongly advise that the federal and state governments should assist tremendously in providing inputs into the recommended grazing reserve land in all the states of the federation and they should continue to be herdsmen/farmer\u2019 friendly.\n\n\u201cIn order to discourage open grazing, the federal government should stop the entry of cattle to Nigeria from ECOWAS countries by amending the Article 3 of ECOWAS Protocol, especially referring to free movement of cattle and other livestock without any special undertaking.\n\n\u201cI strongly appeal to the federal and state governments to maintain all existing grazing reserves by providing special amenities mentioned in my earlier suggestions. It is also necessary that government uses the services of the World Bank to archive all plans that will come out of well modernized grazing reserves in Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young & Luminous Jannamike\n\nOUTRAGE yesterday greeted Wednesday\u2019s recommendation by the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, NGF, that the pump price of petrol be N385 per litre.\n\nThe governors had in their last virtual meeting on Wednesday night, made case for full deregulation, recommending N385 per litre of petrol\n\nHowever, the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Trade Union of Nigeria, TUC, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN, and umbrella body for pro-labour civil society organizations, Joint Action Front, JAF, reacted angrily to the development yesterday, accusing the governors of living in a fools paradise.\n\nThey also accused the governors of failing to appreciate the suffering and the hardships across the country, and warned that the recommendation of the governors would cause socio-economic upheaval if accepted and implemented by the federal government.\n\nRecall that the NGF, after considering the report of its committee headed by Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, accepted the recommendation that backed full deregulation of petrol, and recommended that the pump price of PMS should hover around N385 per litre.\n\nReacting, CAN\u2019s Vice Chairman (Northern Region), Reverend John Hayab, said: \u201cWhere will the Nigerian masses run to? It\u2019s shocking to note that in spite of the prevailing hardship the people are facing, governors are seeking to double the cost of fuel.\n\n\u2018\u2019Does the NGF really care about the pains and suffering Nigerians are experiencing at all? The governors should not fund their respective budgets by making things difficult for the people.\u201d\n\nHe also said the federal and state governments should look inwards and effect the necessary adjustments to boost the economy rather than support the hike of the pump price of petrol by over 100 per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, the various governments should look inwards and make adjustments that will help the economy instead of seeking to increase the pump price of petrol, because doing so will only add to the misery of the masses.\u201d\n\nRecommendation inhuman, unacceptable \u2014TUC\n\nOn his part, President of TUC, Quadiri Olaleye, said: \u201cThe recommendation is unfortunate, preposterous and inhuman. To consider this at a time most state governments cannot even pay N30, 000 minimum wage and workers are losing jobs is inexplicable.\n\n\u2018\u2019It took torganised labour years to negotiate the new wage that has been eroded by inflation. The cost of living has become astronomically high, to the extent that a large number of Nigerians cannot feed.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is obvious in our streets as houses are daily being burgled and kidnapping has become an industry. There is hunger in the land.\n\n\u2018\u2019Farmers cannot go to their farms due to the insecurity challenge and hunger is staring us in the face. This economy can be better managed if only government can shun politics and be open to ideas from patriotic Nigerians who are not members of the ruling party.\n\n\u2018\u2019We reject the N385 pump price a litre governors\u2019 recommendation and want to seize this opportunity to warn that the pressure being put on the masses is becoming unbearable. Nigerians are overstretched and it is dangerous for the country.\n\nIt can\u2019t fly \u2014 PENGASSAN\n\nAlso, reacting, the General Secretary of PENGASSAN, Lumumba Okwugbawa, said: \u201cTheir recommendation will not fly because nobody understands the template they used in arriving at their recommendations. For example, what is the landing cost of the imported PMS?\n\n\u201cPENGASSAN has always supported a deregulation based on local production. Any deregulation based on or driven by importation is bound to cause serious challenges because we are not in control of the fluctuations of oil prices and exchange rates.\u201d\n\nGovs\u2019 proposal unreasonable \u2013CNG\n\nAlso reacting yesterday, the Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, said it was unreasonable for the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum to propose an increase in the pump price of petrol from N162 to N385 at a time the country was in dire economic situation.\n\nCNG spokesman, Suleiman Abdul-Azeez, said such a proposal was inauspicious at a time the nation was struggling to pull itself from the brinks, adding that what the country needed was improvement in the quality of life of the people.\n\nAbdul-Azeez, who noted that the coalition had placed all its affiliates on notice of an impending mass action to force an unconditional reversal in the event of any hike, said: \u201cOur reaction as usual is that the proposal of the governors is unreasonable as almost all their decisions on major national issues have been. The only remaining option is for Nigerians to mobilize and reject any further increase in fuel pump prices.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we have placed all our affiliates on notice of an impending mass action to force an unconditional reversal in the event of any hike.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we condemn the Governors\u2019 proposal as insensitive and completely unacceptable. No responsible government would think of adding to the present dire situation of a country that is already at the brinks.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cIt is an irony that a government that came to power on the back of promises of improving the quality of life of the people would within a few years assume the reputation of being the worst in the history of Nigeria. Buhari\u2019s government that has lost its courage and necessary capacity to secure its citizens is certainly a failed administration.\u2019\u2019\n\nWe support full deregulation \u2014 NECA\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association, NECA, said while governors\u2019 position was just a recommendation, it was in support of full deregulation of downstream sector of the petroleum industry to allow market forces prevail\n\nNECA\u2019s Director-General, Dr. Timothy Olawale, told Vanguard that the governors\u2019 view \u201cis a proposal and every Nigerian is entitled to their opinion. \u2018\u2019NECA supports the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry, in which case market forces should be allowed to prevail\n\n\u201cWe reiterate our call to the government to revamp our refining capacity by rehabilitating existing refineries, encourage the thriving of modular refineries and encourage massive investment by the private sector in product refineries through incentives. This way, the pain associated with deregulation will be assuaged.\u201d\n\nWe remain opposed to deregulation, privatization \u2014 JAF\n\nHowever, Secretary of JAF, Abiodun Aremu, said in his reaction: \u201cOur stance remains struggle to defeat the neo-liberal policies of privatization and deregulation which should be anchored on agenda of system change.\n\n\u201cWhat do we mean by system change? Nigeria is rich. The wealth belongs to the people. Most Nigerians are hungry, have no jobs, no education, no healthcare, no potable water, no electricity supply and no affordable transportation.\n\n\u2018\u2019Most Nigerians cannot feed their families or educate their children. Those who are lucky to have jobs are not much different. They also cannot afford a decent living for their families. On the other hand, there is a very tiny group of Nigerians who have cornered the wealth that belongs to the working people and the poor, who are in the majority.\n\n\u201cThey loot the treasury and use their stolen wealth to sustain themselves in power through their political parties. They use their power to get richer and richer when the poor get poorer and poorer. This is a system of exploitation and oppression.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is the system that brings out the army and the police to kill poor people when they protest against oppression and exploitation. We want to change that system and replace it with a system where the working people and the millions of people who are sufferings under the system of exploitation will win power and ensure that the wealth of Nigeria is used to ensure a good life for majority of the people who are now exploited and oppressed.\u201d\n\nProposal unreasonable \u2013 CNG\n\nThe Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, on Thursday said it was unreasonable for the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum to propose an increase in the pump price of petrol from N162 to N385 at a time the country is in a dire economic situation. CNG spokesman, Suleiman Abdul-Azeez, said that such a proposal was inauspicious at a time the nation is struggling to pull itself from the brinks, adding that what the country needed was improvement in the quality of life of the people.\n\nAbdul-Azeez, who stated this in an interview with Vanguard in Abuja, said that the coalition has placed all its affiliates on notice of an impending mass action to force an unconditional reversal in the event of any hike.\n\n\u201cOur reaction as usual is that the proposal of the governors is unreasonable as almost all their decisions on major national issues have been.

Lot Egopija, Consul-General of Nigeria in New York has described bee farming as an \u201d untapped gold mine\u201d in Nigeria capable of generating more than 10 billion US dollars in annual revenue for the country.\n\nEgopija said this in a message to the World Bee Conference organised by the Nigeria-USA Chamber of Commerce in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe envoy explained that a barrel of honey cost more than a barrel of crude oil, which is currently Nigeria\u2019s black gold.\n\n\u201cBee farming is an untapped gold mine in Nigeria as a barrel of honey cost more than a barrel of crude oil.\n\n\u201cIt is estimated that the industry can generate over ten billion dollars annually.\n\n\u201cIn addition to honey, bee farming yields by-products such as beeswax, bee venom, and propolis that have industrial use in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries.\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that quality bee farming is viable in the rural areas of at least eight states across Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe envoy, therefore, pledged support for any foreign investor willing to go into bee farming in Nigeria, adding that the Trade and Investment Desk in the Nigerian Consulate would assist investors desirous of tapping into the country\u2019s unsaturated bee industry.\n\nEgopija told the conference that as part of efforts to diversify the Nigerian economy, the Federal Government had been encouraging farmers to invest in bee farming.\n\n\u201cThe government has, through Executive Order NO.002 of 2017 on the Ease of Doing Business, removed the bottlenecks inhibiting investment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Export Promotion Council has been mandated to provide adequate information and support to bee farmers to enhance the production, storage, handling, and packaging of honey and other by-products for export,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWorld Bee Day is celebrated on May 20 to draw the attention of the world\u2019s public and political decision-makers to the importance of protecting bees and other pollinators.\n\nThe goal is to strengthen measures aimed at protecting bees and other pollinators which are expected to contribute significantly to solving problems related to the global food supply and eliminate hunger in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), bees and other pollinators, such as butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds are increasingly under threat from human activities.\n\nPollination is, however, a fundamental process for the survival of the world\u2019s ecosystems.\n\nNearly 90 per cent of the world\u2019s wild flowering plant species depend, entirely, or at least in part, on animal pollination, along with more than 75 per cent of the world\u2019s food crops and 35 per cent of global agricultural land.\n\nTo raise awareness on the importance of pollinators, the threats they face, and their contribution to sustainable development, the UN designated May 20 as World Bee Day.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Dozens of Air Peace passengers, Thursday night, slept inside the Arrival Hall at the MM1 wing of the Lagos airport, Nigeria\u2019s busiest.\n\nThe P4 7125 flight from Abuja initially scheduled for 9:00p.m., eventually took off at 11:00pm and landed minutes after 12 midnight despite the nationwide curfew.\n\nOn May 10, the federal government announced another phase of restriction to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe National Incident Manager, Mukhtar Mohammed, said a ban had been placed on human and vehicular movement from 12:00a.m. to 4:00a.m, except those on essential services.\n\nAir Peace customers condemned treatment by the company and wondered whether the airline forgot a curfew was in place.\n\nOne of them told DAILY POST he was disappointed about the service and the fact that travellers had to pass the night on the floor.\n\n\u201cI am appalled, enraged! How do you fly people one hour to the start of restriction time. It would have been okay if we took off at 10:00p.m.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not among the categories exempted from the curfew \u2013 health workers, security operatives, journalists. I\u2019m sure regardless of the time, Air Peace staff would make it home or to hotels.\n\n\u201cSadly, there was no empathy for us who keep them in business, considering that we arrived when most people would not be able to get to their destinations in good time.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even give us snacks and by the time we arrived, the eateries had closed. It is very annoying,\u201d the businessman bemoaned.\n\nOn March 22, the federal government directed airlines to resume catering services on domestic flights immediately.\n\nAviation Minister, Hadi Sirika, gave the order at the Presidential Task Force briefing on COVID-19 in Abuja. The pronouncement is being flouted amid what critics describe as \u2018casual monitoring\u2019 by regulators.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that aside Air Peace, Aero Contractors, Arik Air and Max Air are yet to serve passengers refreshments. However, Ibom Air and United Nigeria offers snacks.\n\nThe incessant rescheduling of flights by air transport providers has become a norm in Nigeria with several harrowing experiences, including travellers waiting for hours and missing appointments, among others.\n\nAttempts to engage Air Peace management over the midnight experience failed as none was available for comment.",

For you to move with your cattle from one point to the other, you have to move through farms, you have to move through population dense areas and this is not very good.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s of course what the Southern governors and in particular the South East are saying, \u2018let\u2019s go back to our traditional method of relationship.\n\n\u201cWe will no longer allow you to take your cattle from one local government to the other. And the implication is that these foreign herders also come in terms of mobile herders with AK-47.\n\n\u201cSo anybody that says there should be no ban on open grazing is on the other hand saying that these killings should continue and that\u2019s what gave birth to ESN whether we support it as Governors. We don\u2019t. But the people tend to support it because of the foreign herders that pretend to be rearing cattle and they\u2019re killing people.\n\n\u201cIn my own village, a white man was kidnapped by these foreign herders while doing construction. And we\u2019ve encouraged the Federal Government, let\u2019s treat this cattle rearing as businesses.\n\n\u201cTake money from the Federation account and develop ranches where there are designated ranches, especially in the North and the northern governors are willing but it\u2019s being frustrated.\u201d",

A situation report (SITREP) by one of the intelligence services sighted by PRNigeria said that the notorious terrorist leader must have been killed during the struggle for power between the Boko Haram and the ISWAP groups. The reports stated that \u201con May 19, 2021, about 1829hours, ISWAP top fighter, Baana Duguri-on this selector \u2013 geolocated around Sambisa forest, Pulka Gwoza LGA BRS, informed ISWAP logistics commander, Modu Sulum- geolocated opposite General Hospital Konduga LGA Borno state, that they killed Abubakar Shekau over all BH leader in Sambisa Forest date.\n\n\u201cDuguri disclosed that the ISWAP fighters\u2019 team surrounded the BH leader with his team and shooting ensued between the two factions. Duguri further added that Shekau detonated a bomb and killed himself when he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Duguri informed Sulum that the two sides also lost some fighters during the shooting. He averred that even yesterday, ISWAP was pursuing Abubakar Shekau and he discarded his cap and ran, but, today, the pursuit continued and he was finally killed. Duguri asked Modu Sulum if the other BH members who fled are returning to their houses?\n\n\u201cIn his response, Sulum rejoiced over the death of Abubakar Shekau and glorified God over the success. He also said few BH members are returning to their houses.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian military has placed all Borno State Commands of the Nigerian Army and Air Force on alert. The troops have lately been carrying out discreet bombardments around the Sambisa axis and Lake Chad axis, which may have triggered the current crisis and strife between the two, hitherto, collaborators.\n\nFindings revealed that ISWAP has been in pursuit of Shekau, which led to him discarding his camp and running off until he was rounded up yesterday, which led to his death. The clash also resulted in some casualties on the ISWAP side. When contacted by PRNigeria, the spokespersons of the military and intelligence services were reluctant to talk.",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has said that intellectual property waiver alone will not be enough to narrow the huge COVID-19 vaccine supply gap between rich and poor countries.\n\nShe told the European Parliament that it was clear that discussions around vaccine patents alone would not suffice, saying that global leaders should do more to ensure that there is equitable production and distribution of the jabs.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala said developing countries had complained that the licensing process was cumbersome and should be improved upon.\n\nShe added that while it makes sense to protect research and innovation, it is also important to expand access to the vaccines.\n\nAccording to her, manufacturers should work to expand production, pointing to idle capacity in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Senegal, and South Africa among other developing nations.\n\nShe said: \u201cI am convinced that we can agree on a text that gives developing countries that kind of access and flexibility, whilst protecting research and innovation.\n\n\u201cTo have solved the unacceptable problem of inequity of access to vaccines, we have to be holistic. It\u2019s not one or the other.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala stressed the importance of diversifying vaccine manufacturing and to have more production taking place in Africa and Latin America to contain the pandemic.\n\nShe told the EU legislators that normal market forces for exports and imports couldn\u2019t apply when it comes to the life-or-death issue of COVID-19 vaccines, as many of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations are hoarding the shots for their own population when the crisis hits their home turf.\n\nShe said although the world could manufacture some five billion vaccine doses overall, it now requires twice or three times that capacity due to the spread of the contagion.\n\n\u201cOne of the main challenges is diversifying vaccine production, which is now 80 per cent concentrated in 10 European, North American and South Asian nations, Okonjo-Iweala said, calling the situation a problem that \u201chas come home to roost.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not normal that Africa, with 1.3 billion people, has 0.17 per cent of the manufacturing capacity of the world. So this has to change.\u201d\n\nEU nations have criticised a call by the United States to waive COVID-19 vaccine patents as a way to increase supplies, saying that the move would yield no short-term or intermediate improvement and could even have a negative impact.\n\nHowever, Okonjo-Iweala sought to remain neutral on the issue, saying that WTO members could find the flexibility to make sure more vaccines are produced in developing nations.\n\nSouth Africa and India have urged fellow WTO members to waive intellectual property rights on vaccines to boost production.\n\nPoorer countries that make up half the world\u2019s population have received just 17 per cent of doses, a situation the World Health Organisation (WHO) has labelled \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d.\n\nThe EU outlined a plan on Wednesday it sees as a more effective way of boosting output, using existing WTO rules, rather than a waiver, noting that countries can grant licences to manufacturers to produce with or without the patent holder\u2019s consent.\n\nIn March, Nigeria received nearly four million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), from Mumbai through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to the vaccines.\n\nThe doses have now been largely exhausted even as India, a major contributor to the COVAX facility, battles to curb the growing number of infections and deaths in the Asian country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Bassey Inyang in Calabar and Sylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday hit home a rebound with the defection of Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAyade, who lost out at the recent state congress of the PDP, helped the APC to regain a foothold in the South-south, which had come under the full control of the main opposition party with the defection and reelection of Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, last year.\n\nUntil yesterday, the PDP controlled the six South-south states of Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\nAPC leaders had made efforts to make inroads into the oil-rich region in the 2019 election with the defection of the PDP Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who led the ruling party\u2019s charge but was roundly defeated.\n\nNext, it made an audacious move for Bayelsa State in the off-season governorship election, winning a pyrrhic victory, which was overturned by the Supreme Court due to the ineligibility of its deputy governorship candidate.\n\nBut the PDP downplayed its loss, urging its members in the state to remain steadfast in spite of the governor\u2019s defection.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on all critical stakeholders and teeming members of our party in Cross Rivers State to immediately pull together and ensure that all structure of our party in the state remains intact,\u201d it said in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan.\n\nThe party said it wished Ayade well in his new political sojourn as well as in his future endeavours.\n\nThe APC, however, congratulated Ayade for what it described as his wise and timely decision to leave a \u2018dead\u2019 PDP for \u201ca living and thriving party APC.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement yesterday, said the total lack of internal democracy, which turned the PDP into a one-man show had caused frustration and alienated PDP governors and legislators from the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe commended Ayade\u2019s decision to join forces with Buhari to build a better Nigeria as a member of the APC.\n\nThe Cross River State governor had after months of frustrations in the PDP elected to jump ship yesterday telling the APC governors who received him that he moved to put the state at the centre of national politics.\n\nAyade, who fell out with the PDP leadership after he lost control of the party structure to National Assembly members from the state attributed his decision to join APC to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s commitment to developing the country, and the need to join hands with the president to build a better Nigeria.\n\nThe Chairman of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, led a delegation of party bigwigs, including governors to Calabar to receive Ayade to the party.\n\nAyade announced his defection while hosting seven APC governors.\n\nBesides Bunu, other governors were: Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Senator Hope Uzodimma of Imo State; Hon. Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Senator Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; and Mr. Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nBefore formally defecting to the APC, he had held a two-hour meeting with the APC delegation.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state Deputy Governor, Prof. Ivara Esu; Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Eteng Jones; and members of the state House of Assembly, some National Assembly members, members of the Cross River State Executive Council, local government chairmen, councillors and some stakeholders, including Senator Florence Ita-Giwa.\n\nAyade said with his defection, Cross River State had become an APC state and urged all its supporters and followers to go to their respective wards and register with his new party.\n\nHe added that he caved in to pressure to join APC because of Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells to Akwa Ibom State, needed to be in sync with the party at the centre.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving seen and known the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point, we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of.\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognise that it is not the party that matters. It is character, it is honour, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation. We all need to work as a team ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if every one of us as governor joins hands with Mr. President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nBuni expressed joy at Ayade\u2019s defection.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Cross River State, formally to the APC. As from today, he is the leader of the party in the state.\u201d\n\nA chieftain of the APC from the state and former Senate Leader, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, also welcomed Ayade to the party.\n\nNdoma-Egba, in a statement yesterday, described Ayade\u2019s entry into the APC as a good development for the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you join us in the progressives fold, my expectation is that your coming will enrich our internal democracy and I enjoin you to be consultative, inclusive, democratic, transparent and accountable because these are the hallmarks of the All Progressives Congress family.\n\n\u201cI also expect that your presence in the APC will further strengthen the party and improve our electoral fortunes in Cross River State.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, described the defection of Ayade as liberation from the forces of retrogression.\n\nOmo-Agege, who is also the leader of APC in the South-south geo-political zone, hailed Ayade for seeing the need to improve his people\u2019s fortunes and further help cement national unity by bringing his state into the APC.\n\nHe said the governor had displayed uncommon courage in order to take Cross River State and the South-south out of the periphery to mainstream politics of the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "OPS Rejects Petrol Price Fixing, Says It\u2019s against Deregulation Policy",
          "text": "Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe representatives of the organised private sector (OPS) of the Nigerian economy have rejected the recommendation by Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) that petrol pump price be fixed at N385 per litre.\n\nThey described the recommendation on fixing the price as capable of complicating the quest for the deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry.\n\nThey, however, stated without equivocation that the removal of petrol subsidy has become inevitable and urged the federal government to find a creative means of achieving it in order to end the regime of fixing the pump price of petrol in the country.\n\nThe Director-General of the LCCI, Dr. Muda Yusuf, who reacted to THISDAY\u2019s question on the implication of fixing the pump price at N385, said: \u201cI wonder why they (the governors) should be mentioning price, which should be a policy matter. Let us discuss policy. What is their business with fixing the price? It is like they even want to complicate matters for the deregulation policy. It is not their business.\u201d\n\nYusuf, however, said that \u201cgiven the huge financing gaps that exist at all levels of government, it is impossible to continue to sustain the subsidy regime. The opportunity cost of petrol subsidy is huge. The fiscal space is just not there. This is what perhaps informed the position of the governors.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the transition from the subsidy regime to a deregulated policy should be handled creatively by the government through the engagement of critical stakeholders to gain their buy-in and provision of palliatives to ameliorate its harsh impact.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe transitioning process from a subsidy regime to a deregulated policy space calls for a strategy that is inclusive and socially sensitive. It is a tricky situation that demands tactful handling. It has a profound social dimension, there is a strong economic argument, there is a significant investment effect and there is a potential substantial political cost.\n\n\u201cBut the bigger conversation should be around what should be done to mitigate the short term adverse social effect on the vulnerable segments of the society.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the focus should be on providing subsidised mass transportation, intracity rail system, subsidised vehicle conversion to the use of autogas accelerated improvement in electricity supply, complete abolition of import duty and all forms of taxes on renewable energy equipment and accessories. There should be an inclusive framework (which should include labour unions) to ensure a transparent management of the revenue gains from the subsidy removal.\u201d\n\nFor the Director-General of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, the governors are advocating for the right policy at the wrong time that is coming at a time when the productive capacity of the economy is facing serious challenges.\n\nOlukanni argued that in the past 12 months, Nigerians have been bludgeoned by the COVID-19 pandemic which not only ravaged their health but their livelihoods.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe period saw successive increases in electricity tariffs, high inflation, and a devalued naira with no commiserate increase in income. Several pundits have pointed to these issues as being at the root of the current level of insecurity in the country. While the private sector has consistently campaigned for a liberalisation of the downstream sector, we have grave concerns of the timing of the policy, which is coming at a time when the productive capacity of the economy is facing serious challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Director-General of the NECA, Mr. Timothy Olawale, told THISDAY that the opinion expressed by the governors is still a proposal, which every Nigerian is entitled to air his or her view.\n\nOlawale stated that the \u201cNECA supports the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry; in which case the market forces should be allowed to prevail\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFinally, we reiterate our call on the government to revamp our refining capacity by rehabilitating existing refineries, encourage the thriving of modular refineries and initiate policies that will attract massive investments by the private sector in product refineries through incentives. This way, the pain associated with deregulation will be assuaged\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "title": "Many people have one concern: NITDA warns Nigerians against digital colonialism as Whatsapp\u2019s new privacy policy takes effect",
          "text": "Whatsapp has been more subtle about telling users to sign new terms of service but NITDA says some dangers remain\n\nIn January 2021, users of the popular instant messaging app Whatsapp got notifications about new terms of service and an updated privacy policy. The notification came with the warning that if users did not accept the new terms by February 8, they would lose access to the app.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most popular apps and owned by Facebook, a company many people distrust, that sort of announcement will hog headlines. There\u2019s also the fact that many tech users are becoming concerned about privacy and the kind of data apps collect about them.\n\nSo for a few weeks, we saw articles suggesting that people should switch to apps like Telegram and Signal, which do not collect as much information on their users. As a result, Signal saw a rush of downloads.\n\nAlthough the pushback was intense, Whatsapp did not budge on its terms and privacy policy; instead, it decided to soft-pedal on the new terms of use and be more subtle about getting users to sign it.\n\nWhatsapp still wants you to agree to new terms\n\nIn the weeks leading up to a new deadline of May 15, Whatsapp began sending reminders to users as an in-app notification. While it will no longer block users from using the app if they don\u2019t agree to the new terms, it will restrict some functionalities.\n\nThe company said in a blog post in May, \u201cfor the last several weeks, we\u2019ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. After giving everyone time to review, we\u2019re continuing to remind those who haven\u2019t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.\u201d\n\nWhatsapp is swapping its forceful method and wants to send reminders until users agree. Yet, countries are still concerned, and in Nigeria, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NIDTA) issued a statement Tuesday about Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp users are at liberty to decide on giving consent to the processing of their data based on the new privacy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) recognises; we have consent (a clear, unambiguous expression of privacy terms communicated by the controller and accepted by the Data Subject) as one of the lawful basis for data processing. Acceptance of the new privacy policy and terms of use implies that users\u2019 data would now be shared with Facebook and other third parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers will now be subject to the terms and policies of Facebook and other receiving entities with or without being direct subscribers to such services.\u201d\n\nNITDA is wary of new policy\n\nAt the heart of the new terms, Whatsapp wants to become a place where businesses directly sell to customers. Small businesses will have virtual storefronts, while bigger businesses will be able to integrate Whatsapp into their existing technology stack.\n\nIn a statement, NITDA published some portions of Whatsapp\u2019s new policy\n\nOne concern many people have is whether Facebook will have access to their Whatsapp chats, but the company insists that messages on the IM platform are encrypted end-to-end. Yet, NITDA says users should \u201climit the sharing of sensitive personal information on private messaging and social media platforms as the initial promise of privacy is being overridden on the basis of business exigencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNITDA is exploring all options to ensure Nigerians do not become victims of digital colonialism,\u201d the agency added in its statement.\n\nIt is not clear what these options are. For now, the choice ultimately lies with users who will determine how to guard their privacy as WhatsApp\u2019s new rules go into effect.",

          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "ZOLA Electric, one of Africa\u2019s leading renewable energy providers, has launched a robust distribution scheme to drive market penetration and access to its product in its quest to provide clean, effective, and reliable power anywhere.\n\nOlufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria\n\nAlready, ZOLA Electric has signed into their distribution network some of the leading distributors of solar and renewable products across Nigeria and has opened its doors to onboard even more. Blue Camel, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions including PV panels, solar streetlights, solar home systems, and a major distributor for global solar brands, was recently signed into the scheme. Blockchain, Black bit Solar, Shokenny Solutions, Enersys Energy, Solarmate Energy, and SOSAI Renewables are already in different stages of the distribution partnership.\n\nAlmost half the population has no access to electricity. The rest of the Nigerian population is grossly underserved by the electricity grid. As a result, diesel generators are the default source of power, with an estimated 100 million people currently relying on diesel generators each day (GTM, 2019). According to Nigeria\u2019s Rural Electrification Agency (REA, 2017), the use of these generators collectively costs Nigeria\u2019s households and businesses nearly USD 14 billion every year, while the Energy to Access Institute (Dalberg, 2019) estimates that fuel subsidies for small gasoline-powered generators cost the government USD 1.6-2.2 billion each year. Besides the economic costs, diesel generators entail significant health risks including lung disorders caused by emissions, as well as environmental risks including air and noise pollution. Diesel generators produce about 29 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions each year in Nigeria, a total comparable to the annual emissions from 6.3 million passenger vehicles.\n\nSigning on distribution partners will contribute significantly to help bridge the electricity supply deficit by expanding access to ZOLA\u2019s innovative power solutions across the country.\n\nThe move by the brand, which currently serves over one million users across three continents in over ten countries, is part of its efforts to boost its current market operation, as well as provide reliable power solutions to markets that lack energy access and make it possible for homes and businesses across Africa and anywhere in the world to generate, store and consume energy sustainably.\n\nAdebimpe Adebisi, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric Nigeria; Olumide Ajayi, Group Director, Technical Operations, ZOLA Electric; Enobong Kennedy, Group Marketing Director, ZOLA Electric; Olufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria and Natasha Amaefuna, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric during the ZOLA Electric Media Meet at the ZOLA Experience Centre in Lagos on Tuesday, May 18, 2021.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria, Olufemi Ashipa, said; \u201cThe solar space in Nigeria has come a long way from the days of using dirty and expensive power resources to clean energy sources, offering modular and scalable technology.

          "title": "Lessons from Ethiopia, Egypt as local airlines set up maintenance facilities",
          "text": "The need to reduce capital flight, save cost and create job opportunities locally is driving Nigerian airlines to set up Maintenance and Repair Overhaul (MRO) facilities, and there are lessons local carriers can learn from African countries that have succeeded in running MROs.\n\nFor instance, AirPeace and United Airlines have concluded plans to set up MROs in Anambra and Enugu, respectively, with other airlines expected to pool into this as a way of getting the local industry to thrive.\n\nAirPeace is partnering the Anambra State government to get Embraer of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth largest civilian aircraft manufacturer, to locate a MRO service centre for Africa in the state.\n\nEven as stakeholders in the sector have commended moves by domestic airlines to set up home-grown maintenance facilities, they also advise carriers to learn from African countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and Kenya that have successfully managed their maintenance facilities.\n\nEthiopian Airlines has its Ethiopian Airlines MRO; South Africa runs its MRO Division, South African Airways Technical (SAAT) Airways; Egypt Air has its commercial Maintenance & Engineering MRO. Kenya Airways operates KQ Technical, its technical and engineering wing providing maintenance services for aircrafts, and Morocco operates its Snecma Morocco Engine Services (SMES), where it carries out expanded maintenance, repair and overhaul.\n\nExperts say these countries and their carriers have built sustainable MROs by managing key components, which include the airlines, service providers and training.\n\nAdo Sanusi, former managing director/CEO of Aero Contractors, says these components have been able to align to the business strategy and the policy of the countries establishing the MROs.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that these carriers have sustained the MRO facilities in their countries by making it commercial to other local and international airlines, developing a plan or pathway for long-term equipment acquisition, retooling, expansion and commercialisation.\n\nThese carriers have also entered strategic partnerships with their respective governments for support and avoiding politicking.\n\nFor instance, Ethiopian MRO caters for carriers within Africa and some European airlines. South African Airways Technical (SAAT) Airways MRO also caters for carriers within South Africa and beyond. These aggregates of aircraft from across various countries help these carriers realise reasonable return on investment to sustain the MRO facilities.\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, says the MRO facilities in these countries have been sustained by building supporting training schools to develop new and young professionals starting from post-secondary school level training in areas such as tooling and fabrication skills. They then proceed to graduate level, empowering them accordingly and at professional level, helping to impact culture, philosophy and continuous programmed development.\n\nNigerian airlines currently carry out major checks and maintenance of their aircraft in Europe, America and Ethiopia Airlines hangar in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia, depending on the degree of maintenance required.\n\nThe initiative to set up MRO is coming at a time Nigerian airlines are struggling with high foreign exchange rate, making it increasingly difficult to pay for spare parts, repair and maintain their aircraft as at when due.\n\nChecks further show there are about 100 aircraft owned by Nigerian airlines, servicing domestic, regional and international routes.\n\nAero Contractors in the last three years maintained about eight Boeing aircraft at its maintenance facilities, implying about 92 aircraft are still being maintained outside the country as a result of absence of aircraft maintenance facilities.\n\nThe cost of a C-check on an average aircraft, which is conducted within 12 to 18 months, cost between $800,000 (N384m) and $1 million (N480m) at an exchange rate of N480 to a dollar. This amount does not include the cost of ferrying the aircraft abroad and other charges.\n\nThis implies that within 12 to 18 months, Nigerian airlines would spend between N35.3 billion and N44.16 billion on maintenance of about 92 aircraft.\n\nAdewale, who commended the initiative of local carriers to build MROs, says the facilities are needed at this time for country\u2019s self-sustainability, to reduce Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit and huge FX outflows due to aircraft maintenance checks, train airline professionals and in turn creating jobs, while also increasing the profitability of domestic airlines.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, member of aviation industry think tank group, Aviation Round Table (ART)/chief executive of Centurion Securities, notes that one of the major problems of the Nigerian airlines is initial poor business plans.\n\nAccording to Ojikutu, major questions airlines would need to ask before setting up MRO would include: \u201cWhat would be the main types of aircraft and market sources of their materials and clients \u2013 locally and regionally? Where would the manpower or skills for the maintenance come from? Who are their proxy competitors locally and/or regionally?\u201d\n\nNigeria for over 30 years tried to establish an MRO facility, which was initially named national hanger, he states. \u201cI advise AirPeace and its partners to research into why the previous efforts failed even when in the past there were few types of aircraft operating in the country, within the region and continentally, (Boeing series mainly),\u201d he says. Now that there are more variants of aircraft, the technical and manpower requirements will be broader, he says.",

          "title": "Why prices of crypto currencies are dropping",
          "text": "In the past few days, many crypto currencies have wiped off significant gains made since the beginning of the year renewing fears of the 2017 burst, where the price of bitcoin crashed from around $20,000 to below $3,500.\n\nBut experts say this time the price decline is different, as the market has stronger fundamentals and is coming into maturity on the back of institutional investments and growth in emerging market consumers.\n\n\u201cThis bitcoin bull run is not just from institutions,\u201d Marcus Swanepoel, CEO/co-founder of Luno, a global crypto currency exchange with a significant presence in emerging markets like Nigeria and other African countries, says in a tweet. \u201cOur (retail) volumes in South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Indonesia all trebled over last month and at all-time highs. Emerging market consumers are voting with their money and they\u2019re ready for a better financial system,\u201d Swanepoel notes.\n\nMore investors in the market mean renewed scrutiny into the workings of the very infrastructure that powers the market and how it is deployed. There are questions about environmental impact, use cases, illicit activity, and regulation.\n\nBitcoin, the most valuable crypto asset, has been the most affected with the price falling by over 30 percent from as high as $58,000 it recorded last week to around $36,000. It recovered on Wednesday towards $40,000 and settled around $40,229 on Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, the end-of-day bitcoin price has fallen by over 25 percent over seven days on four other occasions since the start of 2017. These were December 24, 2017, when the price fell from the $20,000 peak of the 2017 bull run; February 5, 2018, when the price fell below $10,000 as the bull run ended; November 25, 2018, when the price went to $4,000 as crypto winter set in, and Mid-March 2020, when the price fell as low as $4,000 as financial markets reacted to COVID-19.\n\nEthereum price, which surged to an all-time high of $4,308 about seven days ago, dropped to $2,200 on Wednesday before recovering above $2,800. As of press time, the price was at $2,684 on Thursday.\n\nWhile the price fall at 30 percent is high, the price level of both Bitcoin and Ethereum is still significantly high at over $40,000 and $2,000 respectively. The price decline\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nLong before Elon Musk and Tesla came along, there have been debates over the electricity consumption of bitcoin mining and the impact it has had on the environment and climate change.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes to mine one bitcoin. At 600 seconds (10 minutes), all things being equal, it will take 72,000GW (or 72 Terawatts) of power to mine a bitcoin using the average power usage provided by ASIC miners.\n\nIn explaining why it suspended bitcoin payments, Tesla said it was concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\n\nA report by the BBC in February found that the bitcoin network consumes 121.4TWh of power per year, which means that it would be the 29th highest energy-consuming country in the world, above Argentina and below Norway.\n\nIt is however important to also acknowledge that fiat currency printing and minting, gold mining, and the banking system consume far more energy than bitcoin mining.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in bitcoin mining and operations say the technology is built in such a way that it incentivises the use of clean power. This is because it is currently much cheaper than non-renewables, and in an industry with such significant financial rewards, this matters. Miners will always go wherever they can use the cheapest power, and they will move to those regions where power is cheapest.\n\nA report by payment firm, Square, also explains that renewable sources typically produce excessive supply when demand is low. Conversely, they struggle to provide enough when demand is high. The Square report recommends addressing divergent renewable production and demand for electricity by building an ecosystem \u201cwhere solar/wind, batteries, and bitcoin mining co-exist to form a green grid that runs almost exclusively on renewable energy.\u201d\n\nUse cases\n\nThe use cases of crypto currencies remain a concern of many institutional investors. In the past, the most uses for bitcoin have been as a speculative asset \u2013 investors stake capital in hopes of trading for high capital.\n\nBut crypto currencies like bitcoin have potential for transforming payments and remittance in the financial services sector. This is why the market continues to celebrate the entrance of payment institutions such as PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa in the market. US banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also provided support for their investors in crypto currencies.\n\nData from Chainalysis show that institutional investors have spent $410 billion to acquire their current bitcoin holdings. $300 billion of this has made a loss at a price of $36,000. However, the remaining $110 billion in profit is greater than all that had been spent to acquire all bitcoin held in mid-March 2020, when the last major price fall occurred.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nThis is one sore spot that critics of crypto currencies easily spotlight. In Nigeria where authorities have taken a hard stance on the market, the financial regulator accuses crypto currencies of funding terrorism and kidnappings, two malaise fuelling insecurity in the largest country in Africa.\n\nIronically, long before crypto currencies became a trend in the country, fiat has funded criminal networks wreaking havoc, and also oiled the bank accounts of corrupt politicians. But the anonymity of crypto currencies is making it very attractive for criminals.\n\nCybercrimes are also rising with criminals demanding for payment in crypto currencies. A report on Ransomware 2021 by Chainalysis found that known payments to attackers rose 337 percent from 2019 to 2020, when they reached over $400 million worth of crypto currency. Ransomware is reportedly the fastest growing segment of cryptocurrency-related crime, with victim payments to attackers growing 311 percent to reach nearly $350 million worth of crypto currency.\n\n\u201cAttackers show no signs of slowing down in 2021, and have already taken in more than $81 million from victims so far this year. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are low-end estimates, and that the true numbers are almost certainly higher,\u201d the report released in May 2021, noted.\n\nIt is a challenge that many crypto currency operators are still scrambling for answers for. In the absence of regulation, crypto currency exchanges have since taken up the challenge to build their own security firewalls, these efforts have mostly paid off as the number of breaches has reduced significantly.\n\nRegulation\n\nInstitutional investors are also wary of regulatory positions that do not favour the crypto currency market. China, which has since 2017 flirted with the idea of not supporting crypto currency transactions, this week reiterated that financial institutions and payment companies were banned from providing services related to crypto currency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) toed a similar prohibitive path in February 2021. India is also planning a review of regulation for the crypto currency market. The Indian government is reportedly looking at the possibility of regulating crypto currency. Unlike China and Nigeria, Indian authorities think a blanket ban recommended by former finance secretary Subhash Garg in 2019 has become out-dated.\n\n\u201cThere is a view within the government that the recommendations made by the Subhash Garg committee are data and a fresh look is needed at use of cryptos rather than a total ban,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government is not totally aligned with an outright ban of the market. The Vice President and many lawmakers have disagreed with the CBN on the prohibition, recommending regulations for the market instead.",

          "text": "The Kaduna State Government and the Nigeria Labour Congress have reached an agreement on the plan by the state government to lay off workers.\n\nThe NLC has since Monday led workers to protest against the plan by the Kaduna government to lay off the workers.\n\nThe late Thursday agreement between the two parties was brokered by the federal government in Abuja.\n\nPart of the agreement was that the Kaduna government will follow due process and the\u201cprinciple of redundancy,\u201d as stipulated in Section 20 of the Labour Act, in its Public Service Revitalization and Renewal Programme, which is expected to lead to the retrenchment and sack of workers.\n\nThe parties also agreed that the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) twill no longer continue with its industrial action while no worker shall be victimized by the state government on account of his or her participation in the industrial action.\n\nThe Kaduna State Government had earlier announced the sack of hundreds of university teachers and nurses for joining the strike. That announcement is expected to be reversed.\n\nA 10-member bi-partite committee comprising six representatives of the Kaduna State Government, three officials of the NLC, and one of the federal labour ministry was also set up to engage further on how to execute the agreement and ensure that the state government adhered to the principle of redundancy.\n\nThe meeting\n\nThe Thursday meeting was called by the labour minister, Chris Ngige, to put an end to the strike and protest by the NLC over the Kaduna government\u2019s plan to sack workers.\n\nIn the agreement signed by both parties and the representative of the federal government, it was resolved that it is the right of an employer to retrench workers. But in doing so, due process, especially the principle of redundancy, must be followed strictly.\n\n\u201cIt was resolved that the principle of redundancy as stated in section 20 of Labour Act, Cap L 1 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) should apply,\u201d the agreement reads.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Bariatu Mohammed, Head of Service, Kaduna State; Ayuba Wabba, President NLC; Ja\u2019afaru Sani, Commissioner of Local Government Kaduna State; Najeem Usman, Deputy President NLC; Omoabie Akpan, Director Trade Union Services and Industrial Relations; and Muoneke Aloy, Director Finance and Accounts, representing the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Labour.\n\nThe Agreement\n\nThe agreement reads as follows: \u201cFollowing the three days industrial action embarked upon by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on the 17th of May, 2021 in Kaduna State, the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment apprehended the industrial dispute by holding an emergency conciliation meeting between the Kaduna State Government (KDSG) and NLC to deliberate on the following contentious issues as alleged by the NLC.\n\n\u201cRetrenchment of workers by the Kaduna State Government; Compulsory Retirement of workers on Grade Level 14 and above; Compulsory Retirement of workers who have attained the age of 50 years irrespective of their Grade Levels; Reduction of the staff strength of Local Government to 50 in each of the 23 Local Government Areas (LGAs); and Casualization of workers on Grade Level 1-6.\n\n\u201cAfter an exhaustive deliberation of all the issues above at the meeting, the officials of Kaduna State Government debunked all the five issues listed above and ascribed them to political opponents of the State Government.\n\n\u201cThey also said they were only trying to implement the Kaduna State Government Public Service Revitalization and Renewal Programme approved by the State Executive Council since 2016.\n\n\u201cThe NLC also explained their position that they got into the dispute following reports by their Kaduna State affiliate Unions and Negotiating Councils.\u201d\n\nOn the resolutions reached, the agreement said: \u201cthe meeting agreed that all the listed issues fall within the ambit of redundancy therefore, it was resolved that the principle of redundancy as stated in section 20 of Labour Act, Cap L 1 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) should apply.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also recognized that the current impasse was caused by communication gap between the State Government and NLC occasioned by both the local chapter and even the Kaduna State Government Officials.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt added, \u201cin view of the foregoing, the meeting resolved to constitute a 10-man Bi-partite Committee comprising six representatives of State Government and three officials of the NLC to engage further with the objective of reverting with a work plan on how to integrate the provision of section 20 of the Labour Act CAP L1 LFN 2004 to resolve the impasse between the State Government and the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also resolved that the Committee should have as Chairman, the Head of Service of the Kaduna State Government and assisted by a Deputy National President of the NLC. The Committee is expected to revert with the work plan for peaceful resolution of all issues in contention to the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment by Tuesday 25th May, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe work plan is to itemize the structure and sub-structure in the State and Local Government of their activities, time of commencement and envisaged final tenure of the Committee or make recommendations if in its wisdom it thinks the Committee should be a Permanent Standing Committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was agreed that there shall be no further industrial action on these issues and no worker shall be victimized on account of his or her participation in the industrial action.\u201d",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nGovernor of Ondo State and chairman of Southern governors forum, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has described the opposition of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, to the ban placed on open grazing in the Southern part of the country as very unfortunate, and not expected of someone who bears the title of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nMalami had appeared as a guest on Channels Television on Wednesday, where he faulted the decision of Southern governors to ban open grazing during their meeting in Asaba last week, describing it as unconstitutional and an infringement on the herders right to freedom of movement, which according to him, cannot stand.\n\nMalami went on to compare open grazing to spare parts business, noting that Northern governors might as well ban spare parts dealers from operating in the North.\n\nBut responding to his position in a statement on Thursday, Akeredolu maintained that the ban was sacrosanct, adding that Malami\u2019s comparison of open grazing with the selling of spare parts is annoying.\n\n\u201cI have just read the press statement credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Shehu Malami SAN on the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing in their respective States,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.",

The only places that I have seen such facilities are in the United States of America, Dubai and Germany among some of the countries that I have visited where mini-football is played.\n\n\u201cThe uniqueness of the facilities at Ilaji Sports Resort is that all the facilities are in the same enclosure on a verse land, and that would reduce stress on the players, as they would come out of their rooms and walk straight to the pitch without waiting for an official vehicle,\u201d Ben Salha said.\n\nThe Tunisian was elated when he said that while on the inspection of the facilities, \u201cI received calls from more countries indicating interest to participate in the tournament in Nigeria. And from the present situation, we will have about 26 countries in attendance as against 20 entries that I have earlier received before coming to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a great improvement compared to the eleven countries that featured in the maiden edition in 2018 in Libya, and three foreign television stations (which he did not disclose) have approached me for live telecast of the matches of the tournament in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am here in Nigeria as the eyes of the World Mini-Football Federation and all presidents of the African Mini-Football Confederations,\u201d he added.\n\nChairman of the Nigeria Mini-Football Association, Hon Oluyemi Adewale Taiwo, said all hands are on the deck to ensure successful hosting of the tournament.",

          "title": "FEATURES: When Selection Of Vice Chancellors Becomes Do-or-die Affair",
          "text": "The negative nuances of politics and crisis ruining the appointment of vice chancellors in Nigerian universities especially, the public-owned Ivory Tower is giving education stakeholders nightmares.\n\nIn recent times, the appointment of vice chancellors in some universities has assumed everything horrible and unexpected from the citadels of learning.\n\nSome of the schools that have been engulfed in serious crises in the selection of their vice chancellors are University of Lagos (UNILAG), Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma, University of Jos (UNIJOS), Lagos State University (LASU).\n\nLEADERSHIP Friday investigation revealed that the situation has worsened to the extent that in many cases, only the indigenes of the town where the institutions are sited can be vice chancellor of such schools, thus putting aside merit in the selection process.\n\nIn UNIJOS, following the expiration of the five-year tenure of Professor Sebastian Maimako, there has been disquiet in several quarters over the procedure for the selection of a new vice chancellor, which resulted to the exercise being suspended as an invitation was extended to all council members to appear before the executive secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC) in Abuja in April.\n\nThe practice of suspending the selection process has created unnecessary tension within the university community and generated suspicion amongst the candidates thereby brewing conflict in its peaceful environment.\n\nIn the case of UNILAG, which was very controversial, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe was dropped as vice chancellor by the governing council which appointed Prof. Soyombo in acting capacity.\n\nOgundipe had fought back, declaring his \u201cpurported removal\u201d as a \u201cmischievous disinformation\u201d as \u201cthe extant provisions of the law were not complied with\u201d by the council.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoing by the institution\u2019s extant Act, only the president of Nigeria can remove the vice-chancellor \u201cafter due consultation with the governing council and the Senate acting through the minister of education.\u201d\n\nIn the case of AAU, Ekpoma, the Edo state government waded into the crisis by dissolving the governing council and appointed Prof. Osarhieme Osadolor as the acting vice chancellor of the institution.\n\nOsadolor\u2019s appointment was contained in a statement issued on May 11, 2021, by the secretary to the state government (SSG), Mr Osarodion Ogie.\n\nHe said the dissolution of the council was in accordance with Ambrose Alli University Special Intervention Powers, Provisions Law 2021.\n\nLast January, union leaders in LASU kicked against the cancellation of the process of appointing the school\u2019s vice chancellor by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nSanwo-Olu had in a statement announced the cancellation of the process for appointment of the ninth substantive vice chancellor of the state-owned university.\n\nHe had directed that a fresh process that would end in 45 days should begin without delay.\n\nBut leaders of the Non-Academic Staff of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU), Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) in LASU differed on the governor\u2019s action.\n\nShocked by the rising tension in some universities as a result of vice chancellors\u2019 appointments, education experts suggested that the only solution is to make the process transparent by giving each candidate a fair shot at the position without any preferred or anointed candidate, sponsored by external or internal forces.\n\nThey stressed that university system is one that thrives on integrity, detribalisation, sincerity, commitment and nationalism, therefore, in a situation where needless interferences are made to bear on the system, it demoralises people of integrity working there, therefore, application of merit and extant laws should be put into consideration when selecting vice chancellors.\n\nA former vice chancellor of Plateau State University (PLASU), Bokkos, who is the current director-general of Research Planning and Documentation, Office of the Governor of Plateau State, Professor John Wade, said emphasis should be on merit in vice chancellors\u2019 appointments.\n\n\u201cLet me take you back again, going through the memory lane of institutions, the University of Jos still remains the best and the fairest in terms of appointment. I know that in the past 15-20 years, you always found non-\n\nindigenes as the deputy vice chancellor. I challenge you to go to many universities in the country, you will find some deputy vice chancellors coming from the same village as the vice chancellor. That is how bad things have gone in the system!\n\n\u201cBut I think the most important thing without prejudice, people are conscious. Plateau State has quite a number of vice chancellors in other universities, we have a complement of vice chancellors in other universities. So, you may find some people arguing that okay if you can be vice chancellor in other universities, why can\u2019t others be there in your own university? The system there too, then, allows fair competition, non-interference. Let merit take its course.\n\n\u201cIf out of 20 candidates interviewed from Plateau State failed and the best came from Bayelsa State, so be it. Because this system is something that always wants to prove excellence.\n\n\u201cSo, I think that reading between the lines and watching things from a distance, what I want to say is that we want transparency, we want honesty, we don\u2019t want manipulation, that is where the fear is. And the university system like I said over and over again in this interaction has zero tolerance for manipulation and transparency.\n\n\u201cIf you want to enjoy the university system first and foremost there are institutions that are established by law and as an institution established by law, they enjoy a substantial degree of autonomy; and because they enjoy substantial degree of autonomy, there is supposed to be no interference. Indeed, there is not supposed to be any interference whatsoever except when things have gone out of control.\n\n\u201cNow, this implies that as a way forward, that the university system should be allowed to function based on the rules and regulations or the extant law that established it. Where they are supposed to carry out function or any form of duty, there are rules and regulations guiding it and allow them to do that. A situation where outside influence or interference comes in, because you know, giving the high number of people working there in terms of intellectualism, in terms of professionalism and what you are trying to manipulate is not healthy for the system,\u201d he said.\n\nWade said the way forward is to allow the system to work without interference. \u201cWhere things are wrong, the university system has its checks and balances, that is why I always said when I found myself as a political appointee, I observed people scream a lot each time a new administration comes on board, setting up judicial commissions of inquiry, the first thing the political class or people in the society attribute to you is that you are trying to witch-hunt.\u201d\n\nOn the raging crisis in some universities over interference and appointment of their vice chancellors, he said an institution whether state, local government or federal that strictly adheres to admitting only their indigenes can even fail accreditation because there is no balancing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy the tradition of tertiary institutions and as enshrined in the constitution all over the world, whether it belongs to local government, state or the federal government, it automatically becomes an international institution where it can admit people from all over the world (Europe, America), it can also recruit researchers, teachers from different parts of the world.\n\n\u201cHaving said that and given the spirit of how things are moving, in most federal universities, it has become a norm for people to struggle for key offices.\n\n\u201cBut I think there is a coincidence of fate you found that where people tend to agitate more is where you have many qualified candidates. For example, I can confidently say that the University of Jos when we started about 35 years ago, I think we were five Plateau indigenes that were of PhD standard and we are the few professors there, people like Nenfort Gomwalk, Prof. Monday Mangwat. Some of us were baby lecturers then,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Professor Michael Umale Adikwu, former vice chancellor of the University of Abuja, said universities should consider appointing people with the quality and capacity to lead the institutions to greater heights rather than where they come from.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing that happens in Nigeria is that you must be from a particular village before you will be vice chancellor in the university. That is terrible, it doesn\u2019t happen in other countries.\n\n\u201cIn the United Kingdom (UK) some of their VCs are from the US, you don\u2019t even need to have a PhD if the university is in distress financially. What they are looking for is somebody who can bring in money, we are doing things upside down and times have gone when universities were meant to give only certificates,\u201d he said.\n\nThat notwithstanding, the Fellow of National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria (NPMCN), Prof Matthew Enosolease, said there shouldn\u2019t be a crisis in one becoming a vice chancellor but merit.\n\n\u201cThe universities, unfortunately, are like the rest of the Nigerian society; they reek of nepotism, self and at best, their ethnic group. Today\u2019s VCs just like any ordinary politicians are there to serve the people otherwise it simply does not make sense to deploy all forms of subterfuge, bribery, intrigues and maybe some lethality in the process of becoming a VC. It beats me always, thinking about it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough, not every public university in the country faces a crisis when it comes to vice chancellor\u2019s appointment, calls for due process and application of merit have continued to grow.\n\nIn Cross River State, both the University of Calabar and the Cross River University of Science and Technology (CRUTECH), state-owned-university have no crisis over the appointment of their vice chancellors.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the chairman of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), CRUTECH branch, Dr Emmanuel Etta, stated that the vice chancellor, Prof. Austin Okoh Angba, appointed to head the school on November 6, 2020, has the support of both staff and stakeholders of the institution. \u201cWe have no trouble with the VC, he is a young man that won the heart of many.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the institution public relations officer, Mr. Onen Onen, stated that there was no agitation among the staff and students of the institution regarding the appointment of vice chancellor, whom in his estimation is loved by all factions.\n\nOn why there is always tussle when it comes to the appointment of vice chancellors, Onen said, \u201cYou don\u2019t blame them, it\u2019s an executive office, people would like to achieve and accomplish themselves.\n\n\u201cIf there were to be contention, there would have been agitations. Here we are with no agitation since Prof Austin Amgba came on board as VC of the institution. It means there is no agitation.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the chairman of ASUU, UNICAL branch, Dr. John Edor, said, \u201cThere is no crisis in our institution regarding the appointment of vice chancellor. Our vice chancellor just came on board some months ago in December 2020.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to explain if there were issues at stake such as the lure of office or ethnic factors, the ASUU chairman said, \u201c No issue at all. We like the vice chancellor, notwithstanding the fact that she is a female. Even those who contested against her at last congratulated her after she was declared the winner of that contest.\u201d\n\nOne of UNICAL\u2019s lecturers and dean, Faculty of Law, Prof. Cyril Ndifon, said there is no crisis regarding the appointment of vice chancellor, stressing that the appointment of the current vice chancellor is a step in the right direction. Ndifon said the institution has no problem regarding the appointment of vice chancellor.",
          "summary": "In recent times, the appointment of vice chancellors in some universities has assumed everything horrible and unexpected from the citadels of learning.\nLast January, union leaders in LASU kicked against the cancellation of the process of appointing the school\u2019s vice chancellor by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\nI know that in the past 15-20 years, you always found non-indigenes as the deputy vice chancellor.\nI challenge you to go to many universities in the country, you will find some deputy vice chancellors coming from the same village as the vice chancellor.\nPlateau State has quite a number of vice chancellors in other universities, we have a complement of vice chancellors in other universities.",

          "text": "*Probe DISCOs transfer of consumer debts\n\nTom Okpe, Abuja\n\nIn view of the present hardship confronting the nation, the House of Representatives has urged the Federal Government to direct the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to decline its decision to increase electricity tariff proposed for June, 2021.\n\nThe House reached this resolution on Thursday at plenary, adopting a motion sponsored by Aniekan Umanah (PDP, Akwa-Ibom), mandating the Committees on Power, Poverty Alleviation and Labour, Employment and Productivity to ensure compliance.\n\nWhile moving the motion, Umanah recalled that the Electric Power Sector Act of 2005 established the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission with a mandate to license Distribution Companies (DISCOs), determine operating codes and standards, establish customer rights and obligations and set cost-reflective industry tariff.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the Electric Power Sector Act prescribed its funding from 15% of electricity charges paid by customers to Distribution Companies.\n\nHe noted that NERC, working with Distribution Companies, has increased electricity tariffs five times since 2015, the latest, 1 January 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cDespite those increases, Nigerians have not enjoyed significant improvement in power generation, instead, daily grappling epileptic services from the DISCOs and unilateral exploitation in the name of estimated billing arising from non- metering of over 50% of consumers.\u201d\n\nHe observed that poor services by the DISCOs have impacted negatively on the socio-economic growth of the country as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report of 2020 on Nigeria indicated that the manufacturing sector lost over $200 billion to inadequate power supply while a whopping $21 billion was said to have been spent by Nigerians on generating sets within the period under review.\n\nHe expressed concern that at a time governments all over the world are adopting measures to cushion the devastating effects of the dreaded COVID\u201319 pandemic on their citizens by providing a wide range of palliatives to losses of loved ones, jobs, businesses and general distortion in the social life, NERC is tinkering with the idea of a further increase in electricity tariff after that of 1 January, 2021, in a country where 2/3 of the 200 million population is grappling with the crippling effects of the pandemic.\n\nThe former Akwa-Ibom State Commissioner for Information also observed that; \u201cthe Nigerian masses have gone through so much hardship in recent times arising from acts of terrorism, banditry, kidnappings, farmers and herdsmen\u2019s crisis with its toll on agricultural activities, displacement from ancestral homes, loss of loved ones, starvation arising from inability to return to daily occupation and loss of personal properties running into several million of naira.\u201d\n\nUmanah was also concerned that the current economic recession made worse by hyperinflation has resulted in skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs, while the increase in prices of Petroleum Products has also triggered the further increase in transport costs and rents with unemployment rates at a frightening 33.3% while the spending power of an average Nigerian has drastically reduced, any further hike in electricity tariff at this time will amount to overkill, lack of empathy and height of insensitivity.\n\nIn a similar development, the House also resolved to investigate transferred debts incurred by old electricity customers to new users by the Distribution Companies in Nigeria.\n\nIt mandated the Committee on Power to engage the Distribution Companies and other relevant Regulatory Agencies, particularly NERC to find a lasting solution and report within four (4).\n\nThe Green Chamber urged the Power Committee to investigate the status of prepaid meters as a policy of the Federal Government, mandating the Committee on Legislative Compliance to ensure compliance.\n\nIn a motion moved by Shoyinka Olatunji from Lagos State, he lamented the constant complaints by electricity consumers on the poor services provided by DISCOs which are also in the habit of transferring outstanding debts of old customer to new users.\n\n\u201cAlso concerned that if nothing is done to curb the act of transferring debts incurred by other consumers to new consumers, the later will continue to bear the burden of paying for the electricity they did not consume.\n\n\u201cAware that the Distribution Companies, which are responsible for the collection of payments for services rendered to consumers allow unpaid bills to accumulate, do not follow the laydown principles and guidelines by Regulatory Authorities towards unpaid bills and disconnection of non paying customers.\u201d",

That was seven years ago. He kept me posted and I have since followed the development closely, waiting for the dream to come to a reality.\n\nI make bold to say that Dr Afolabi is a man of big dreams and a goal-getter who sticks to his dreams and is always ready to get great things done. He is a rare breed, and I congratulate him on this feat. Seeing this big dream come through is something that makes me happy.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the relationship he has with the ace entrepreneur, Ogunsan, took time to explain in details.\n\n\u201cIf you care to know who Dr Taiwo Afolabi is to me, he is my \u2018egbon\u2019 (senior), mentor and inspiration.\n\n\u201cI blessed the day our path crossed at the prestigious Institute of Directors of Nigeria. We happened to be on the same committee and our first assignment was to pay a courtesy visit on The Nigeria Shippers Council, in a bid to bolster the administration of the maritime sector where he has remained a major stakeholder. Since then, our relationship has grown so rapidly.\n\n\u201cHe invited me to his new restaurant in the UK during our Annual Institute of Directors Convention.

          "text": "Abubakar Shekau, notorious Boko Haram\u2019s leader reportedly committed suicide by blowing up himself during battle with Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters.\n\nAFP had earlier reported that Shekau was seriously injured when he shot himself in Sambisa Forest on Wednesday after his faction was surrounded by ISWAP fighters.\n\nHe was said to have shot himself in the chest, but his followers managed to escape with him.\n\nBut HumAngle online, noted for Boko Haram/ISWAP reports, said the wanted Boko Haram fighter died after he blew up himself.\n\nHe died along with yet unidentified ISWAP commanders.\n\nThe Nigerian Army said it was studying the report from AFP that Shekau had died.\n\nArmy spokesman, Mohammed Yerima said: \u201cWe are investigating\u201d the death of Shekau.\n\nIt was gathered that ISWAP, which had broken away from the Shekau-led Boko Haram faction in 2016 after pledging allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS), raided the group\u2019s hideout using multiple gun trucks.\n\nIt was reported that Shekau\u2019s enclave was tracked down by ISWAP using its forces based in the Timbuktu Triangle. His fighters were killed in the process, followed by a long gunfire exchange between the invading group and Shekau\u2019s bodyguards.\n\nHumAngle reported that after his bodyguards were subdued, Shekau surrendered and engaged in an hours-long meeting with the ISWAP fighters.\n\nDuring the parley, he was asked to voluntarily relinquish power and order his fighters in other areas to declare allegiance to ISWAP\u2019s authority.\n\nThe negotiators had expected Shekau to issue a statement.\n\nSources within the insurgency, however, said that Shekau who secretly had a suicide vest on eventually blew himself up alongside everyone present during the negotiations.\n\nBut quoting intelligence sources, AFP , on Thursday, reported that after a series of clashes, Shekau and some of his fighters were surrounded on Wednesday by ISWAP jihadists in Boko Haram\u2019s Sambisa forest stronghold, where they demanded he surrendered.\n\n\u201cTo avoid capture, Shekau shot himself in the chest and the bullet pierced his shoulder,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cHe was badly injured.\u201d\n\nShekau made international headlines when his men kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014.\n\nHe has been reported dead many times since Boko Haram first began its insurgency in 2009.\n\nShekau had been declared dead many times by the military authorities.\n\nBut each time, he resurfaced in a video, poking insults at President Buhari and the military.\n\nThe Americans have a long standing $7 million bounty, about N2.8billion on his head.\n\nThe United States Department of State had designated Shekau as a terrorist and in June 2013, it announced a reward of US$7 million for information leading to his capture.\n\nThis was done under its Rewards for Justice programme.\n\nIn contrast, the Nigerian military announced a N50 million, about $100,000 bounty for his capture.\n\nBut in his videos, Shekau always mocked those hunting for him, claiming he was invincible and that he \u201ccould not die except by the will of Allah\u201d.",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has accused his counterparts of not giving him the support he deserved in his face-off with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).\n\nLabour union had crippled economic activities in Kaduna over what they described as anti-people policies of El-Rufai.\n\nIn the warning strike called off on day three, protesters trooped to the streets, calling on the governor to reverse the sack of 4,000 workers.\n\nThe Progressives Governors Forum advised El-Rufai and labour leaders to return to the negotiation table and stop flexing muscles.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for muscle flexing. Nigerians are already overstretched with many challenges. At this critical point of our democratic journey, there cannot be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens. Every step must be therefore taken to resolve the current face-off between Kaduna state government and NLC. We appeal to both the State Government and NLC to return to the negotiating table,\u201d Kebbi state Governor and PGF Chairman Atiku Bagudu had said.\n\nBut at a virtual meeting of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), El-Rufai criticised the NGF, saying the press release was not helpful.\n\n\u201cThat press release with the greatest respect was unhelpful. It was unhelpful, it said nothing, it was trying to play both sides. I am a governor, I am one of you, the least I expect from the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum is unequivocal and unqualified support. I didn\u2019t see that in that statement. I am being very blunt; I could pretend and be political and just smile and say it was alright but it is not. But I am used to fighting my own battles.\n\n\u201cWe are not running a unitary system, we are a federation. We are elected to govern different states, we owe our people accountability not the NLC, we should take a common stand,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai also insinuated that there was a conspiracy against the Kaduna state government.\n\n\u201cIf it is about rights of workers Kaduna is not the only state that has retrenched workers, Kaduna is not a state owing salaries, Kaduna is not a state failing to pay minimum wage, Kaduna is not a state owing years of pension arrears. Why didn\u2019t they go there? Kaduna was targeted for political reasons, and they are being financed by certain political interests.\n\n\u201cBut we will fight them, we will defeat them but as the governor of Bayelsa said, and since he has brought that subject, I have a responsibility to put it through, unless we collectively address this monster, it will consume all of us.\n\n\u201cAfter this, they will never come back to Kaduna, they will never come back, you will see. They will go to other states, it\u2019s up to the forum to decide on what to do, but we are here, we are ready, we will end this by the grace of God,\u201d he said.\n\nFG sets up c\u2019ttee\n\nMeanwhile, the meeting at the instance of Minister of Labour and Employment Dr Chris Ngige to resolve the industrial disputes between labour and the Kaduna state government have agreed to set up a 10-member committee.\n\nThe committee, according to a Memorandum of Understanding , resolved that membership include Head of Civil Service of Kaduna State as Chairman and five other representatives from the state government and three representative of the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that all the listed issues fall within the ambit of redundancy therefore, it was resolved that the principle of redundancy as stated in section 20 of Labour Act, Cap L 1 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN) should apply.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also recognized that the current impasse was caused by communication gap between the State Government and NLC occasioned by both the local chapter and even the Kaduna State Government Officials.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, the meeting resolved to constitute a ten (10) man Bi-partite Committee comprising six (6) representatives of State Government and three (3) officials of the NLC to engage further with the objective of reverting with a work plan on how to integrate the provision of section 20 of the Labour Act CAP L1 LFN 2004 to resolve the impasse between the State Government and the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also resolved that the Committee should have as Chairman, the Head of Service of the Kaduna State Government and assisted by a Deputy National President of the NLC.\n\n\u201cThe Committee is expected to revert with the work plan for peaceful resolution of all issues in contention to the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment by Tuesday, 25th May, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe work plan is to itemize the structure and sub-structure in the State and Local Government of their activities, time of commencement and envisaged final tenure of the Committee or make recommendations if in its wisdom it thinks the Committee should be a Permanent Standing Committee.\n\n\u201d In conclusion, it was agreed that there shall be no further industrial action on these issues and no worker shall be victimised on account of his or her participation in the industrial action,\u201d the MoU stated.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Tanko Sununu said there is need for amendment of the existing National Health Insurance Scheme Act for actualisation of the Universal Health Coverage and by extension, health security.",

          "text": "The House of Representatives has called on the Federal Government to stop the proposed increase of electricity tariff for June.\n\nThis formed part of the resolutions by the lawmakers during Thursday\u2019s plenary in the lower chamber of the National Assembly in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThey stressed that it was important to direct the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to rescind its decision on the proposed increment in view of the hard times Nigerians were going through.\n\nSimilarly, the lawmakers mandated the House Committees on Power, Poverty Alleviation, as well as Labour, Employment and Productivity to ensure compliance with the directive.\n\nA member of the House, Aniekan Umanah, had raised a motion seeking that the nation\u2019s electricity regulator should suspend the proposed increase in electricity tariff.\n\nHe wondered why there would be an increase in electricity tariff at a time when Nigerians were going through hard times and governments all over the world were providing means to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the motion, the Electric Power Sector Act of 2005 established the NERC with a mandate to license Distribution Companies (DISCOs), determine operating codes and standards, establish customer rights and obligations, as well as set cost-reflective industry tariff.\n\nThe lawmaker stated that the Act prescribed its funding from 15 per cent of electricity charges paid by consumers to distribution companies.\n\nHe decried that NERC, working with the distribution companies, had increased the tariff five times since 2015, the latest being on January 1, 2021.\n\n\ufeff\n\nLack Of Empathy\n\nDespite the increases, Umanah lamented that Nigerians have not enjoyed significant improvement in power generation but grapple with daily epileptic services from the DISCOs.\n\nHe also accused the distribution companies of exploitation in the name of estimated billing arising from non-metering of over 50 per cent of consumers across the country.\n\nThe lawmaker informed his colleagues that poor services by the DISCOs have impacted negatively on the socio-economic growth of the country, saying the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report of 2020 on Nigeria indicated that the manufacturing sector lost over $200 billion to inadequate power supply while $21 billion was said to have been spent by Nigerians on generators within the period under review.\n\nHe noted that Nigerians have gone through many hardships in recent times arising from acts of terrorism, banditry, and kidnappings.\n\nUmanah said he was concerned that at a time governments all over the world were adopting measures to cushion the effects of the COVID\u201319 pandemic by providing a wide range of palliatives to losses of loved ones, jobs, businesses and general distortion in the social life, NERC was considering a further increase in electricity tariff in a country where two-thirds of its 200 million population were grappling with the effects of the pandemic.\n\nHe stressed that the current economic recession made worse by inflation has resulted in disturbing prices of foodstuffs, and increased prices of petroleum products have triggered the further increase in transport costs and rents.\n\nThe lawmaker added that the spending power of an average Nigerian has drastically reduced, warning that any further hike in electricity tariff would amount to overkill, lack of empathy, and height of insensitivity on the part of the government.",

The AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\nClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\nComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\nMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and the decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\nThe decision to ban open grazing stays. It will be enforced with vigour.\n\nSIGNED\n\nARAKUNRIN OLUWAROTIMI O AKEREDOLU, SAN\n\nGOVERNOR, ONDO STATE",

The party stood by me all through the way,\u201d the governor said during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn any other legal issue that I have had, PDP had stood with me. PDP gave me the opportunity to be a senator; PDP gave me the opportunity to be governor. I would never have any time to pull down PDP. I have integrity, character, and honour.

          "text": "A gas explosion at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital has killed one person.\n\nAn aide to the former Nigerian President, Atom Lim confirmed the explosion and noted that there was a fatality in the incident while one other victim was rushed to the hospital in a critical condition.\n\nMr Lim in a statement posted on Facebook said the incident occurred around 11:00 am on Thursday.\n\n\u201cEarly reports indicate that the explosion was caused by gas used in maintenance of ACs at the unit. An investigation has been launched for further details and action,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe Managing Director of the library, Vitalis Ortese, said the explosion occurred when a pair of technical vendors were conducting routine servicing of the air conditioning units.\n\n\u201cThe explosion, which occurred at about 11.04 am, unfortunately, led to the death of a technical vendor and serious injury of the second vendor,\u201d Ortese said in a statement that corroborated Lim\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cThe emergency team of the Library immediately took action to prevent further damages and subsequently moved the injured to the hospital. Visitors into the complex were temporarily limited to contain any fallouts from the explosion. This has, however, been restored after clearance by the fire services authorities.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
