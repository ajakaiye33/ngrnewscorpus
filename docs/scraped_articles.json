          "text": "Russian troops keep waxing stronger at keeping its neighbouring Ukraine on a tight leash, in the nearly two-month-old Russo-Ukrainian war that has severely strained diplomatic relations between Moscow and allied European nations, with the latter doing their best in trouncing the Russian economy as punitive measures meant to level it down to an international pariah.\n\nHere are the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:\n\n\u2013 Eastern offensive begins \u2013\n\nRussia says its forces have carried out dozens of airstrikes in eastern Ukraine as part of a major offensive in the Donbas region that had been expected for days.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry confirms strikes on Ukrainian positions in the key town of Slovyansk and on towns close to the frontline.\n\n\u201cWe can now confirm that Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, which they have been preparing for a long time,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says.\n\n\u2013 New Mariupol ultimatum \u2013\n\nRussia calls on Ukrainian forces to \u201cimmediately lay down arms\u201d and issues a new ultimatum for the defenders of the besieged port city of Mariupol to end their resistance.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry says that defenders of Mariupol will be \u201cguaranteed survival\u201d if they lay down their arms starting at noon (0900 GMT).\n\nUkrainian forces in Mariupol ignored a previous such ultimatum on Sunday.\n\n\u2013 Deaths in Lviv \u2013\n\nFive \u201cpowerful\u201d Russian missiles hit the western city of Lviv, which had been mostly spared by the fighting, killing at least seven people and wounding eight, local officials say.\n\nRussia says it has also destroyed an arms depot near Lviv containing weapons recently delivered to Ukraine.\n\n\u2013 New US arms shipments arrive \u2013\n\nThe first shipments of a new US military aid package have arrived at Ukraine\u2019s borders to be handed over, a senior Pentagon official says.\n\nThe package includes 18 155mm howitzers for the first time, as well as 40,000 artillery rounds, 200 M113 armoured personnel carriers, 11 Mi-17 helicopters and 100 armoured multi-purpose vehicles.\n\n\u2013 Biden to hold meeting of allies \u2013\n\nUS President Joe Biden will convene a meeting of allies on Tuesday to discuss the Ukraine conflict, the White House says.\n\nThe video call will also cover \u201cefforts to hold Russia accountable\u201d, it says.\n\n\u2013 Putin honours Bucha-linked brigade \u2013\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin bestows an honorary title on a brigade accused by Ukraine of \u201cwar crimes\u201d and mass killings in the town of Bucha.\n\nA decree signed by Putin gives the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the title of \u201cGuards\u201d for defending the \u201cMotherland and state interests\u201d and praises the \u201cmass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage\u201d of its members.\n\n\u2013 Tycoon seeks prisoner exchange \u2013\n\nRussian state television broadcasts a video of two men it says are captured Britons asking to be exchanged for Viktor Medvedchuk, a recently captured Ukrainian tycoon close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nUkraine\u2019s security services then put out a video of Medvedchuk asking to be exchanged for Ukrainian civilians and soldiers trapped in the strategic besieged port of Mariupol.\n\n\u2013 Nearly 5 m have fled Ukraine: UN \u2013\n\nMore than 4.9 million Ukrainians have fled their country following the Russian invasion, says the UN\u2019s refugee agency.\n\nThe UNHCR says 4,934,415 Ukrainians have now left the country, up more than 65,000 on the previous day.\n\n\u2013 Turkey warns will take years to restore trust with Russia \u2013\n\nTurkey warned on Tuesday that it could take \u201cdozens of years\u201d to restore trust between the West and Russia following Moscow\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOf course, we are seeing the start of a new Cold War,\u201d Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a joint media appearance with his visiting Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto.\n\n\u201cIt will take a long time to make up for it. It may take dozens of years to restore trust, but we believe that swift steps should be taken for a ceasefire,\u201d he added.\n\nTurkey, which has enjoyed warm relations with both Russia and Ukraine, has been trying to mediate an end to the nearly two-month conflict.\n\nAs a NATO member, it has supplied Kyiv with combat drones but has shied away from joining Western sanctions against Moscow.\n\nTurkey has hosted two rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the past, blaming allegations of Russian atrocities in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha and a missile attack on a train station in Kramatorsk for a breakdown in the peace process.\n\n\u201cDespite the changing circumstances in the field, we believe there is still a chance for diplomacy to work,\u201d Cavusoglu said.\n\n\u2013 Russia seeks to \u2018liberate\u2019 east Ukraine: defence minister \u2013\n\nRussia\u2019s defence minister on Tuesday said Moscow was seeking to \u201cliberate\u201d east Ukraine but accused the West of dragging out the military operation by supplying Kyiv with arms.\n\n\u201cWe are gradually implementing our plan to liberate the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics,\u201d Sergei Shoigu said in reference to eastern Ukraine\u2019s two rebel regions, which Moscow has recognised as independent states.\n\n\u201cWe are taking measures to restore peaceful life,\u201d he said in a televised meeting with Russian military commanders.\n\nShoigu\u2019s comments came after Kyiv accused Russia of unleashing a major new offensive in eastern Ukraine, marking the second stage of Moscow\u2019s nearly two-month military operation in the former Soviet state.\n\nBut Shoigu laid the blame for the bloodshed on Washington and its Western allies.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Western states under its control are doing everything to drag out the military operation for as long as possible.\n\n\u201cThe growing volume of foreign weapons supplies graphically demonstrate their intention to provoke the Kyiv regime to fight to the last Ukrainian,\u201d he said.\n\nAFP",

It is clear to me therefore that these killings are the handiwork of politicians who are after the APC members,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nHe warned that the killings must stop now as his government is neither weak nor lacking in the zeal to deal with the perpetrators except that his administration has zero-tolerance for blood-letting.\n\nGovernor Uzodimma wondered how the burning of police stations, local government headquarters and the killing of innocent and hapless citizens could help to advance the course or aspiration of any politician.\n\nWe won\u2019t comment on Uzodinma\u2019s U-turn \u2014IPOB\n\nMeanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, have said that they would not respond to the comments of Governor Uzodimma blaming politicians for the killings in Imo.\n\nRecall that Uzodimma and IPOB had been pointing accusing fingers at each other over the incessant killings and destruction of properties in Imo state.\n\nThe IPOB had accused the Governor of using security operatives to kill its members and those of the Eastern Security Network, ESN.\n\nIPOB\u2019s Media and Publicity Officer, Comrade Emma Powerful, said there was no need to join issues with the Governor because they know why he was saying that.\n\n\u201cIPOB is not a violent group neither do its members involve in violence or killings of anybody; so we won\u2019t say anything about that Hope Uzodimma statement because we know why he is making that comment,\u201d Powerful said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Funmi Ajumobi and Elizabeth Osayande\n\nStakeholders in the education sector have faulted the closure of all campuses of the Chrisland Schools by the Lagos State Government, saying dealing with the identified errant students would have been more appropriate.\n\nThis is also as they have faulted the series of tests reportedly carried out on the female student at the centre of the crisis.\n\n\n\nA legal practitioner, Mrs. Helen Essien, wondered why the government would shut down a whole school because of the misdemeanor of a few students.\n\n\u201cWhy did government shut down a whole school because three or four children misbehaved? Doesn\u2019t Chrisland have school discipline policy and procedures? Why punish innocent pupils?\u201d\n\nAnother respondent, Ezinne Njoku-Obi, noted, \u201cWhy punish innocent pupils? Why shut down about seven or eight of the schools in the group? Will that solve the problem? Should such a matter be publicized knowing minors are involved?\u201d.\n\nFor Omolola Davis: \u201cThe only fault of the school is the alleged \u201ccover up\u201d. Closing all annexes of Chrisland schools is unfair. For It wasn\u2019t a murder case. It didn\u2019t happen on the school premises. It wasn\u2019t a rape case. Didn\u2019t they consider the remaining many students and employees?\n\nObo Effanga: \u201cExactly my query. Why not hold the school officials to account for their poor supervision of the children during the trip rather than shut down the school and punish other innocent children from continuing with the school work?\n\n\u201cNigerians can be too emotional and I can see many are supporting this indefinite shutdown thing. If some of us ask otherwise, they will claim that every other child in the school is exposed or going to be exposed.\n\nIndefinite shutdown of Chrisland schools, unnecessary.\n\nIbuoye Bunmi Afolabi: \u201cI don\u2019t blame the government for closing down the school. Chrisland, remember had a saga where one Mr Adegboyega defiled a two year old girl and was sentenced to 60 years imprisonment. Now another one has happened.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to thier policy on Safe School Initiative. Chrisland should have learnt a lesson from the previous one. If you can take a child away from his/her parent to another country or even within the country for whatever reason then you should be accountable for that child. Nothing must happen until you return that child back to his/her parent.\n\n\u201cWhere were the teachers that went with them? Was there any routine check? Why would a child under their watch leave her room without them knowing and they didn\u2019t notice that someone was missing in their midst?\n\n\u201cIt means the other students are not safe as well. Even the teacher who was supposed to be with those boys,where did they go? Chilling at the bar or what? This could have been prevented.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Chapter of Child Protection Network, an initiative of UNICEF has shown her displeasure at the way Chrisland College subdued a 10 year -old girl to psychological torture in their investigation into the matter.\n\nSpeaking through the president of the organisation, Mrs Ronke Oyelakin, carrying out pregnancy test on a minor without the parents\u2019 consent, according to the mother in a video released by her, is absurd and against the rights of the child.\n\nOyelakin however said thorough investigation must be carried out because there are many questions that answers must be provided for by the school and the parents.\n\n\u201cWhy would you run a pregnancy test? What measure was put in place in getting professional help with extensive discussion in helping the children involved?\n\n\u201cHaving a Child Safeguarding and Protection Policy is not enough, but ensuring implementation at all levels\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll agencies and stakeholders have to brace up and see to preventing this act in future\u201d. Oyelakin added.",

That\u2019s why I kept quiet now, or did you hear me say anything?\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what everyone is saying now. Somebody reach out to me, saying, \u2018when you said it years ago they insulted you.\n\n\u201cAll those women that their husbands are beating, don\u2019t they have brothers?

          "text": "By Alao Abiodun\n\nThe management of Chrisland Schools, Lagos has refuted allegations that the institution conducted pregnancy tests on one of the students who participated in the World School Games in Dubai, UAE last month.\n\nThe school was reacting to the viral sex video that surfaced on social media and the allegation of rape by mother of one of the students while in Dubai.\n\nRather, the management said it only conducted COVID-19 tests on the students when they returned from the Dubai trip in accordance with laid down protocols on the pandemic.\n\nThe Lagos State government has ordered the indefinite closure of all branches of the school in the State following the distribution of the videos involving the minors.\n\nThe mother of the 10-year-old girl, while alleging that Chrisland School attempted to cover up the gang rape of her daughter, alleged that they also conducted a pregnancy test on her without their consent.\n\nThe school said out of the 77 students in Dubai, only six were involved in the \u201cimmoral act\u201d.\n\nA statement seen by The Nation from the school management, said: \u201cWe have followed up on reports making the rounds on certain developments bordering on the morals and ethics of some of the students under our care, who represented the school at the World School games, Dubai between 8 and 14 of March 2022.\n\n\u201cWhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\n\n\u201cHowever, after a comprehensive evaluation of the situation, we cannot help but express how scandalised and distressed we feel as mothers, fathers and instructors with a relationship that holds a direct bearing on the development of those involved.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, we took a critical view of the number of students who partook in this recent trip and who did the school proud in our quest to expand the horizons of our students holistically through global exposure, which takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements.\n\n\u201cOf the 76 children who represented Chrisland, 71 ensured an untainted adherence to our standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. Within these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and Boys on the 4th floor to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\n\u201cWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. This was also to caution our students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences.\n\n\u201cThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform our children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cWhile we hasten to affirm that as an institution that is managing children from diverse backgrounds, we cannot lay claim to, or embark on any sense of self-righteousness in our approach, but we learn and evolve within the frames of best practices every single day.\n\n\u201cAs such, as we recognise that there will always be space for improvement, we are therefore irrevocably committed to re-evaluating our processes to reinforce child protection protocols, even as we shall leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the senses of esteem of the children involved are uncompromisingly preserved.\n\n\u201cWe have activated child protection processes and shall be engaging the expertise of child psychologists to ensure we translate this incidence to benefit the children in our care.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore not going to give room to sentiments that adopt less empathy in terms of the effects of the present situation on our children. We implore all of us as stakeholders to work together as build-up partners, rather than pull-down enablers.\n\n\u201cFor every comment we make in this delicate period, we should remember that those involved are children and as such, they deserve our very responsible management of this situation in order not to affect their mental health, as we seek to clear this temporary fog in the path of their growth. This is why irrespective of currently charged emotions, we need to endeavor to keep our heads in focus, while carrying the authorities along in manners that leave nothing hidden, especially as we had nothing to hide.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to reassure our stakeholders that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place on our watch. For emphasis, only a COVID post travel test was conducted on the returning delegation of our students, in compliance with COVID-19 travel protocols, at the Life Centre Medical Services on March 21, 2022 at School Hall, Opebi.\n\n\u201cThis was through the nose swab test as consistent with COVID-19 health protocols. We trust that this can be verified at the source provided. To insinuate that a pregnancy test was carried out on a student, for whatever reason therefore, is a highly unfortunate conjecture.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, our processes would be readily opened up for the scrutiny of regulators and stakeholders at the earliest indication of this, to enable the course of scientific or forensic inspections. We are certain this will lay to rest any shred of doubt or hazy optic that the present flurry of activities might have occasioned.\n\n\u201cFinally, we assure parents and guardians that we take unequivocal cognisance of the duty of care entrusted on us and we would never betray this, as we are more than ever resolved to work harder at keeping and building the trust reposed in us. We refuse to indulge in or give credence to the sentimental contrivances seeking to fuel this crisis the more with various renditions that have taken over the social media space.\n\n\u201cThe only account we are obligated to render is how well the children entrusted in our care have been managed, as we have excelled in doing in this past 45 years of our existence as an educational institution, and to ensure that in this whole development, the only winners here shall be this children.\u201d",

          "title": "National insecurity: Has Kogi found the solution?",
          "text": "Although Kogi State may not be entirely crime-free, it seems to have found a way for its people to cohabit without the terrorism, banditry and ethno-religious violence rocking some parts of the country. This was x-rayed at a seminar for Political and Crime Correspondents. PRECIOUS IGBONWELUNDU and ROBERT EGBE report.\n\nIn Nigeria, geographers often describe Kogi State as \u201cthe South of the North and North of the South.\u201d This historical uniqueness was not lost on Governor Yahaya Bello, who said at the weekend that his state, owing to its location, is perhaps the only state in Nigeria with true Wazobia influences of the 3 major groups (Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo) in the country. He said this during a two-day \u201cSecond Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) Seminar for Political and Crime Correspondents,\u201d with the theme \u201cSetting the Agenda for 2023,\u201d which held in Abuja.\n\nIt is, in many respects, a fitting description for the 31-year-old Northcentral state, which is the only state that shares boundaries with ten states in Nigeria \u2013 Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nasarawa, Benue, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, and Niger. It also has several ethnic groups and languages: Igala, Ebira, and Okun (a Yoruba Group) with others such as Bassa Nge of Bassa Local Government Area (LGA), Kupa and Kakanda speakers, who are a people of Nupe extraction under Lokoja L.G.A., Bassa-Komo, which is also of Bassa LGA, Oworo people (a Yoruba Group), Igbo, Ogori Magongo, and Idoma. The state\u2019s geo-location also makes it a major transit route for many southern travellers to Abuja or northern travellers to the Southsouth or Southeast.\n\nKogi\u2019s past security challenges\n\nAt the seminar, speakers and participants highlighted aspects of the state\u2019s security situation before and during Bello\u2019s tenure. For instance, Kogi State Security Adviser, Commander Duro Omodara (rtd) identified the common security challenges in Kogi in 2016 when Bello took office as terrorism, high rates of kidnapping, armed robbery, bank robbery, recurrent Fulani/host community clashes, cultism, labour agitation, political unrest and communal clashes, among others.\n\nOmodara, who delivered a paper entitled, \u201cSucceeding in the fight against insecurity, terrorism: the Kogi example,\u201d traced the problems to several factors. They include the state\u2019s \u201cgeographical location, the general security situation in the country, the established strategy of using the youths as tools for political actualisation (thuggery), unemployment, low-level collaboration and synergy among security agencies, lack of well-structured intelligence gathering, failure to involve the people in intelligence gathering and participation (community policing) and lack of the will-power on the part of those at the helm of affairs.\u201d\n\nOmodara noted that, in the fight against insecurity, no two states are the same in the application of techniques and deployment, especially as more so that \u201cno two states in Nigeria are the same as it relates to people, typography, geographical location, access roads, infrastructures, religion and ethnic diversity.\u201d He further noted several security challenges and incidents in the state, including, \u201cacts of terrorism as a result of activities of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) and some elements of Boko-Haram, the attack on correctional centre on 12 September 2021, bank robbery at Egbe on 21 December 2021, isolated kidnapping cases, Itobe \u2013 Alu, Ofagolo \u2013 Ayingba, Ofu-Dekina LGA, Aduge, Ogale in Ijumu LGA, the influx of bandits from Nasarawa State through Sardauna Village and Fulani/herdsmen and host community clashes.\u201d\n\nSurmounting security challenges\n\nSpeakers at the seminar argued that the security challenges had largely been successfully tackled by the implementation of several policies by the state government. Governor Bello listed some of the measures his administration had put in place to achieve the relative success. \u201cSome of the measures taken by the government to tackle insecurity include clearing of highway bushes, equipping security agencies, engagement of youths in vigilance groups and incorporation of hunters into anti-kidnapping squad.\u201d\n\nHe noted that his administration also involved citizens in the fight against insecurity through the involvement of local government chairmen and traditional rulers in the security arrangement of the state. Governor Bello explained that the kidnapping of his mother provided an opportunity for him to work hard to rid the state of all forms of criminality and make it safe for the citizens.\n\n\u201cUpon my assumption of office as the executive governor of Kogi, I saw it as a divine opportunity among others to rid the state of all crimes and criminality. To achieve this goal, we decided to take simple steps to frontally tackle crime in our society. Some of which is highway vegetation control by clearing six metres on either side of the highway across the state. This simple initiative improved visibility for travellers and eliminated high impulse of kidnappers that usually pound on unsuspecting travellers around blind spots of the highways to execute their nefarious activities.\u201d\n\nBello added that his administration in 2016 procured over 200 patrol vehicles equipped with communication gadgets which were distributed to all security agencies in the state to enable them to embark on daily highways patrol. In addition, he noted that he established the Nigeria Army Forward Operations base at Achoze in Okene LGA, which helped to reduce crime to the barest minimum in the senatorial district which used to be the headquarters of kidnapping and armed robbery.\n\nThe Governor explained that he set up the Kogi State Vigilante Service recruited about 3,500 people, many of whom had retired from various security outfits and were engaged and trained as vigilantes to provide security to lives and property in rural areas. He added that following intelligence that most of the heinous crimes were committed in rural areas, the state government in collaboration with the federal government trained 441 Special Constabulary Police at the Nigerian Police Training College, Ilorin and they have been assisting the conventional police in information gathering and prevention of crime across the 21 local government areas. Since its inauguration last year, criminal activities had reduced drastically in rural areas, he said.\n\nBello emphasised the role of the purchase and deployment of modern technology to fight crime, the purchase and distribution of over 160 vehicles to the security agencies and vigilantes, coordinated clearance operations by security agencies in the state, regular meetings with critical stakeholders: traditional rulers, Aldo, CAN, JNI, LGA chairmen and recognition of hunters to function with vigilantes and in some military operations.\n\nOmodara also elaborated on some of the government\u2019s actions to check crime. He added that data were collated and analysed, \u201ca well-structured intelligence gathering system\u201d was created for the state, critical stakeholders like, traditional rulers, youth leaders, and market women were identified as having roles in providing security. He said the state also identified neighbourhood watch as critical to the provision of security (Know Your Neighbour), it created the needed synergy among the security agencies, the establishment of Operation Total Freedom in September 2016 for effective 24 hours patrols.\n\n\u201cThe strength is now about 545 troops involving the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy, Nigeria Police, DSS, NSCDC,\u201d Omodara said. \u201cOur approach to insecurity in the state is very different. First, the people must be carried along in any approach to fighting criminalities; this is much so that criminals live among the people. The body language of a leader must clearly reflect the fighting spirit and the people must be convinced. This is the situation in Kogi with Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cLeadership approach to insecurity is key to finding solutions to insecurity in the Country. Leadership and management skills must drive our performance. In Kogi State, the people understand our approach; we are fighting terrorists and other criminalities by applying our local compact system that is suitable for the state.\n\n\u201cToday Kogi remains foreign investors\u2019 destination. This can be attested to by the records obtained from the Nigeria Immigration Service indicating an increase in the number of expatriates living and working in the State as shown: 2014 \u2013 56; 2015 \u2013 72; 2016 \u2013 (May 73, August 98) \u2013 171; 2017 \u2013 214; 2018 \u2013 246; 2019 \u2013 263; 2020 to date 297. We take issues concerning security seriously including study tours of Military and Security Institutions. Their visits provide us with a lot to share and their reports are taken seriously,\u201d the security expert added.\n\nRecommendation for federal government, other states\n\nThe governor and Omodara recommended several measures the federal government and states can take to achieve the \u2018Kogi success.\u2019 \u201cSecurity is a work in progress; you cannot eliminate criminalities neither can you go to sleep when winning the war. In the fight against insecurity, there are no two states that are the same in the application of techniques and deployment. This is more so that no state in Nigeria is the same as it relates to people, typography, geographical location, access roads, infrastructures, religion and ethnic diversity.\u201d\n\nThey further urged the federal government to recognise the peculiar nature of each state, (typography, landlocked, riverine, nature of crime associated, etc.).\n\nThey noted that a state like Kogi, with over 80 per cent of North/South crossing on a daily basis, needs special attention in the area of deployment and funding, while Niger State, with the largest land expanse, cannot be compared with a smaller land area. Other tips include that neighbouring states must, as a matter of urgency, begin to synergise in intelligence gathering and deployment of technology in fighting crime to curb inter-State crimes. Prosecution of criminals must be revved up and government at all levels should secure ungoverned areas along with the federal government. Opposition in Nigeria must harmonise efforts with the government in the fight against insecurity. Killings and mishaps in the country must not be celebrated as a failure of a government. \u201cOpposition must stand with the government as a result of calamities, rather than turning it to political celebrations.\u201d\n\nAwards for journalists\n\nThe event also featured the award of millions in cash prizes to journalists following an essay competition. The first, second and third prizes of N2million, N1million and N500,000 were won by journalists from Oracle, ThisDay and Punch newspapers. The cash prizes were given to the winners at the event.\n\nGovernor Bello also awarded a scholarship to the family of The Nation\u2019s Crime Correspondent, Precious Igbonwelundu, for the education (up to university level) of her daughter, baby Gila. Dignitaries at the event included Chairman, Senate Committee on Aviation, Smart Adeyemi; National Coordinator of Hope 2023, Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Sen. Jonathan Zwingina; former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode; Commissioner of Information in Kogi State, Kingsley Fanwo; President Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Chief Chris Isiguzo, President Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE) Mallam Mustapha Isa, veteran Nollywood actors Prof Sola Fosudo and Keppy Ekpenyong, among others.",

          "title": "Lagos Transportation Policy remains in limbo",
          "text": "After three years, experts are asking, where is the Lagos State Transportation Policy unveiled with fanfare? ADEYINKA ADERIBIGBE writes\n\nExperts agreed that Lagos State couldn\u2019t have been luckier. Successive governments since the take-off of the Fourth Republic have prioritised transportation, with this administration making it the first critical pillar of its six core focus under its THEMES agenda.\n\nThey lauded the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration for its commitment, which has continued to shine brighter with the initiatives aimed at making the sector more responsive to the needs of a growing population, which is projected to hit 40 million by 2042, from its 25 million.\n\nBut that is where it ends. The government had remained less than transparent in its expenditures in the sector. Billions of Naira, would, undoubtedly, have been sunk in the provision of the Blue and the Red Line Lagos Urban Rail Transit system (LURT), the charting of more waterways and introduction of modern ferries, and the initiatives under the Lagos Bus Reforms (LBR), which sought to make public sector transit more attractive, and removing more people from the captives of okada/tricycles, rickety small buses and personal car shuttles.\n\nYet, they wondered what continued to keep the government from releasing the transportation policy midwifed by the past administration and submitted shortly before it wound up in 2019.\n\nAddressing a stakeholders\u2019forum, which held at Alausa, Lagos, Ladi Lawanson, the then Commissioner of Transportation, had said the desire to develop a policy for the sector was to address the challenges plaguing it.\n\nHe said the state is already bearing the weight of its 23 million population with 93 per cent of them being active road users who made an average of 40 million trips daily.\n\nHe said the absence of the policy has been weighing against the development of the sector.\n\nStakeholders are, however, beginning to wonder why a government which seemed determined to improve the lot of the sector had continued to shilly-shally on its implementation.\n\nThe least the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, could offer, recently, was that the government had been reworking the document.\n\nHe said an amendment was necessary before the document was reintroduced into the public.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say is that we are working on an amendment of the transportation policy and very soon, the governor will unveil it to the public. When it is eventually released, we would have a policy document that would be more robust and would address the gamut of transportation options and alternatives that will optimise transportation and traffic control in a sustainable manner in line with THEMES agenda,\u201d he said.\n\nOladeinde, former director in the Lagos Metropolitan Transportation Authority, LAMATA, was a member of the panel of experts who drafted the policy.\n\nA member of the panel at the weekend wondered why it was taking the government too long to implement.\n\n\u201cI have had cause to ask the commissioner on no less than three occasions why the policy is being delayed and the answer has been the same \u2013 that the government is reviewing it to make it more robust. My question is: \u2018if the main document took us less than six months to put together, why would amendments, which are just meant to make it more robust taking the government almost four years?\u2019\u201d Professor Iyiola Oni of the Directorate of Transportation, University of Lagos, said.\n\nOni, who put together the road component of the policy, said, many of the panel members are seeing the assignment to develop a transportation policy for the state a \u201cmere waste of time\u201d, adding that one of them, Dr Tajudeen Ba\u2019walla, who lived all his life in the service of the sector, died three months ago without seeing the policy implemented.\n\nBa\u2019walla, a Russia-trained railway engineer, was a former Managing Director of the Lagos State Mass Transit Service (LSMTS), and pioneer Dean of the Lagos State University School of Transportation (LASU-SoT).\n\nAnother member of the panel, Prof. Samuel Odewunmi, agreed with Oni, carpeting the government for delaying the implementation of the policy.\n\nOdewunmi, who drew the nexus between transportation and the economy, said Lagos has lost much ground in its failure to implement the policy, adding that such policies could be amended every five years to reflect demand or trend and develop the state\u2019s capacity to address the needs of the population.\n\nOdewunmi,who drew the framework of the policy, added that the state wants to professionalise the Ministry and make it the supervisor over agencies in the sector.\n\nOdewunmi, who wondered how a large state like Lagos, with a population of 23 million, would be operating without a road map. He stated that a weak road map is far better than none, adding that the state would continue to run in cycles where there is no strategic road map.\n\nHe called for the ironing of scope of responsibilities between the Ministry of Transportation and its Works counterpart, adding that while 80 per cent of the scope of work of the latter revolves round road works, it exercises no authority over the regulation of road activities, a development that has continued to generate friction.\n\nOdewunmi, a former dean, LASU-SoT, said: \u201cPolitical wire-pulling might be behind the continued hesitancy of the government to release the all-important element that has the potential to develop the sector. With the way the government is going, I do not see this government releasing the document.\u201d\n\nFor experts, a nexus exists between transportation and the economy. According to them, to move the economy, you need to fix transportation.\n\nThe way to go, they said, is a properly planned public transportation system. \u201cThere is the need to open up the transportation system, expand the infrastructure base and target the masses, who need one form of public transportation or the other to move every day,\u201d Dr. Oladayo Timothy said.\n\nManaging Director, Planet Projects Limited, Mr Biodun Otunola observed that of the 20 million population in the state, nine use public transportation daily.\n\n\u201cIf commuters pay just N100 per trip, about N9 billion exchanges hands daily within the state\u2019s economy.That is about N270 billion monthly.\u201d\n\nThe huge revenue, according to Otunola, goes into private hands, as the sector remains unregulated and grossly underfunded.\n\nDescribing transportation as \u201ca leveller between the rich and the poor,\u201d and an infrastructure that cannot be provided by an individual, Otunola, whose firm is helping Lagos to troubleshoot its transportation and urban renewal challenges, said the answer lies in the government focusing on providing \u201csafe, convenient, comfortable and affordable\u201d mass transportation alternatives.\n\n\u201cThe road is where the rich and the poor meet. Both classes of people are usually held in traffic congestion. The future is not in the provision of \u201cfree education or free health\u201d, but in providing innovative solutions to traffic congestion, which is the challenge facing modern day governance across the world.",

          "title": "Senators, Reps to court: sustain Electoral Act 84 (12)",
          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Abuja\n\nThe High Court lacks the powers to order the deletion of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, the National Assembly has told the Court of Appeal.\n\nIt urged the appellate court to order the retention of the section, adding that Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court in Umuahia erred in law when she ordered the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to delete it.\n\nThe section provides that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party\u201d.\n\nIn an appeal against the judge\u2019s verdict, the Federal lawmakers raised five grounds of appeal on why the court should set aside the March 18 judgment.\n\nIt is also asking that the case be heard before the political parties hold their national conventions to select candidates for next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nNot determining the appeal before the deadline for the submission of the list of candidates will defeat the purpose of the law, the National Assembly said.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has given the parties June 3 deadline to complete the conventions.\n\nThe lawmakers, through their 18-man legal team, led by Dr. Kayode Ajulo, based their appeal on five grounds, namely:\n\nThe trial judge erred in law and thus acted without jurisdiction by hearing the suit of Chief Nduka Edede without joining the necessary parties.\n\nThe judge erred in law and consequently violated the National Assembly and the Clerk to the National Assembly\u2019s (appellants\u2019) right to a fair hearing when being conscious of the existence of their interest\n\nThe provisions of Section 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(g), and 182(1)(g) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) relied upon by the judge only relate to public servants and does not include political appointees.\n\nThe judge determined the merit of the first respondent\u2019s (Chief Nduka Edede\u2019s) suit without considering his locus standi to institute it.\n\nThe judge erred in law and exceeded her jurisdiction when she ordered the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to delete the provision of Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act, 2022 with immediate effect.\n\nThe National Assembly said: \u201cThe record of appeal confirms that the subject matter of the first respondent\u2019s suit before the trial Federal High Court revolves around the determination of the constitutionality or otherwise of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe section regulates the internal democracy of political parties in Nigeria, with particular reference to the conduct of conventions or congress of any political party in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere was sufficient evidence before the lower court that the interest of the National Assembly empowered to make laws for the regulation of internal democracy within political parties, including making laws for the conduct of the party primaries, party congresses and party convention pursuant to the provision of Section 228 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), would be affected by the determination of the constitutionality or otherwise of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act by the trial Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cThe principle of law is that where a necessary party is not joined to a suit, the trial court ought to have suo motu directed a joinder of the necessary party for a just determination of the interest of same.\n\n\u201cHaving not joined the appellants herein as defendants at the trial court, the learned trial judge had the prerogative and responsibility to ensure that the proceedings agree with the justice of the case by directing the joinder of the appellants as parties to the suit before determining their interest.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly claimed that its powers were prejudiced by the court when Section 84(12) was declared unconstitutional, null and void without joining the appellants.\n\nThe National Assembly faulted the Federal High Court judge for not giving it a fair hearing by denying it an opportunity to be heard.\n\nIt alleged that the judge allegedly occasioned a miscarriage of justice.\n\nIt said: \u201cFair hearing is a constitutional right that underlines the adjudicatory power of the court to determine any case.\n\n\u201cHad the court afforded the appellants an opportunity to be heard by joining them to the suit, its resolution on the case would have been different.\n\n\u201cThe appellants had no knowledge of the pendency of the suit and the proceedings conducted therein, but there was evidence before the court indicating that their interest as the federal legislative arm of government would be affected.\n\n\u201cThe proceeding conducted and judgment delivered by the court in the absence of the appellants is a nullity.\u201d The National Assembly said it was wrong of the judge to rely on Sections 66(1) (f), 197(1) (f), 137(1) (g) and 182(1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution to nullify Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\nIt said the sections only relate to public servants and do not include political appointees.\n\nThe appellant said the trial judge \u201cmisconceived the clear position of the law and gave a perverse judgment\u201d when she held that Section 84(12) is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 66(1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137(1) (g) and 182(1) (g) of the constitution.\n\nOn the plaintiff\u2019s locus standi, the National Assembly claimed that he did not sufficiently disclose to the lower court how his constitutional rights, as a political appointee/officeholder, had been or were likely to be breached.\n\n\u201cIt is trite law that a person instituting an action before a court of law must have the legal capacity to initiate such suit before the court can invoke its jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe first respondent also failed to show a breach that is higher and above that of the ordinary citizens with respect to the constitutionality or otherwise of the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act,\u201d the lawmakers said.\n\nThe National Assembly also claimed that the judge exceeded his jurisdiction when he ordered the Attorney-General of the Federation) to delete Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act, 2022 with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nIt said nowhere in Section 6 of the constitution or elsewhere is the legislative power of the federation vested in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe position of law is clear to the effect that the court neither makes law nor does it possess any power to amend any statute.\n\n\u201cThe learned trial judge thereby usurped the legislative powers of the National Assembly by directing the AGF to delete the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cThe order of the learned trial judge directing the second respondent to delete the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 is therefore null and void and ultra vires of the jurisdiction of the Court as donated by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended),\u201d it said.\n\nThe National Assembly sought an order to allow the appeal and set aside the judgment delivered by Justice Anyadike.\n\nRequest for urgent hearing\n\nIn an April 12 letter to the Presiding Justice, Owerri Judicial Division, the National Assembly asked the Court of Appeal to hear its case before the national conventions.\n\nThe Assembly demanded an accelerated hearing before the deadline for the submission of the list of candidates for the general election.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by the Assembly\u2019s counsel, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, was exclusively obtained from the court by The Nation.\n\nIt said in part: \u201cWe humbly submit that given the special circumstance and the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit at the lower court and bearing in mind that same borders largely on the conduct of political party congresses and conventions, if the applicants\u2019 motion and appeal are not given expedite and accelerated hearing before the deadline for the submission of list of candidates for general election, the intentions of the National Assembly in making the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 would be defeated.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstance, we, therefore, most humbly apply for expedite and accelerated hearing of both the Motion on Notice for Leave to Appeal as interested parties and the Appeal for the determination of the constitutionality or otherwise of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.We are most grateful.\u201d",

          "text": "By Precious Igbonwelundu, Sampson Unamka, Damola Kola-Dare, Alao Abiodun and Samuel Oamen\n\nLagos shuts Chrisland Schools\n\nSchool denies rape, pregnancy tests\n\nThe Lagos State Police Command said it has commenced investigation into the alleged rape of a 10-year-old pupil of Chrisland Schools.\n\nThe state government also announced the closure of all Chrisland schools in the state pending the outcome of investigations.\n\nA viral video purportedly recorded during a Truth or Dare game by pupils of the school while in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for the World School Games, showed the minors engaging in sexual activity.\n\nThe video attracted public outcry after music executive, Ubi Franklin, in a series of tweets, alleged that the girl was raped and her parents kept in the dark by Chrisland Schools.\n\nPolice spokesman Benjamin Hundeyin said the command had commenced investigations.\n\n\u201cThe command is equally taking cognizance of the cybercrime angle to the whole episode and would not hesitate to enlist the support of the Interpol should the need arise.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has assured that due diligence will be observed to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing temporary closure of all Chrisland schools, the government said all allegations were being investigated by relevant MDAs including Ministry of Education, Office of Education Quality Assurance, Ministry of Youth and Social Development, Ministry of Justice and the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency.\n\nIt said the criminal allegations have been escalated to the Commissioner of Police.\n\n\u201cWe also use this medium to remind the public that any person, who engages in any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a child, commits an offence and is liable to custodial sentence of 14 years. This includes \u201cproducing, distributing, receiving or possessing an image of child pornography.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, all Chrisland Schools within Lagos State are hereby closed, pending further investigations.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Franklin shared a video recording of the girl\u2019s mother where she accused the school of conducting three pregnancy tests on her daughter without their consent.\n\nThe woman also claimed that the school kept them in the dark on what truly transpired in Dubai and only told her during a meeting that her daughter and a boy kissed.\n\nThe aggrieved mother, who said the video was only brought to her notice by another parent, said the school suspended her daughter when her family started raising issues, adding that one Mrs. Azike, to whom she handed over her child, also stopped taking her calls when they realised she had known the truth.\n\nThe woman said: \u201cMy child attended Chrisland School, VGC. I am crying out to everyone to help me out. About a month ago, I was on my way out of Lagos when I got a call from Mrs. Azike, the head teacher from Chrisland School.\n\n\u201cShe called me that she needed to see me and I told her I would come when I returned. So, I went there two days after. When I got there, I met two other women in her office; one introduced herself as Mrs. Kemi from Chrisland headquarters and that they just wanted me to know that my daughter, who I left in their care and took to Dubai, had a kiss with a boy.\n\n\u201cThey said they found out that they got the kissing game from Truth and Dare. I said OK, if that\u2019s that, I will take her phone away from her so that she won\u2019t practice it again because that was what they wanted me to do. I asked if there was any other thing. She said no. Even Mrs. Kemi told me that I should not tell my husband, that it is not everything women disclose to their husbands.\n\n\u201cI said okay as long as this is just kissing, I will caution my daughter. I didn\u2019t hear anything from them again. The girl was going to school. I thought everything was fine not until after two or three weeks that we had the conversation, Mrs. Azike now sent me a link that she wanted us to have a zoom meeting by 5pm.\n\n\u201cI said okay. By the time I logged on and didn\u2019t see anybody, I called and she said she will contact the rest. I realised the meeting was with members of the board of directors. I didn\u2019t know the names of participants and I asked that they introduce themselves. One said his name was Mr. Akin and he was the one leading the meeting and was speaking in parables.\n\n\u201cI said if it extends more than this (kiss) my husband will definitely know about it. So we finished the meeting without me getting a clue. The day after, a parent called me that she needed to see me because it was urgent. So, I went to her house and she said there\u2019s a trend in Chrisland that I did not know.\n\n\u201cShe told me to see the video that all the parents were aware. I began to beat my daughter.\n\n\u201cMy daughter then opened up and said Mrs. Azike threatened her not to speak out. She narrated how the school abandoned them in a hotel and how she got into this. They have been sending people to have meetings with my daughter without our consent.\n\n\u201cI am begging Nigerians to help me because they were trying to push us out of the way and my daughter is going insane. Please help me fellow Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOn the part that Chrisland played to cover up this issue, on Mother\u2019s Day, we were all there, not knowing that they had other people that came to interrogate my daughter. After I left, they took my daughter elsewhere. \u201cAgain they had been threatening my daughter that if she spoke, they would kill her, that it is a man\u2019s world. Every day I forced her to go to school she would always feel reluctant. Her class teacher would always call her a useless, stupid girl in front of other children.\n\n\u201cPlease help me. They took her to do pregnancy test without us knowing and lied to us that they were taking her for COVID-19 test. They took her almost three times. After all of that, they sent her a suspension letter.\n\n\u201cAfter I handed her over to you to go to Dubai and we paid a lot for that trip, you got there and left them uncared for. Please, Nigerians help me. When I was asking my daughter for explanation, she said that they went out in the morning for breakfast and one of the boys Kachi begged her to lend him her phone charger and she did.\n\n\u201cLater in the evening after dinner, Kachi called her room to come and get her charger. When she went to the place, one of them opened the door and told her to take her charger from the toilet. It was from there they now hijacked her and told her to take a substance after being under the influence of drugs and after that she didn\u2019t know what she was doing again and she was on the boys then one of them made a video and posted on social media.\u201d\n\nChrisland is not new to sexual controversy. In 2018, a court convicted a 46-year-old teacher of the school, Adegboyega Adenekan, for raping a two-year-old female pupil.\n\nIn a suspension letter signed by the head teacher, G. I. Azike, the school told the parents that their ward was a \u201cmajor and wilful participant\u201d in a Truth or Dare game with other male pupils, and that she \u201cwas involved in improper behaviour during the recently concluded World School Games in Dubai\u201d.\n\nThe school did not state the nature of punishment meted out to the male student involved or the others in the room when the act was done.\n\nThere have been reactions to the viral sex tape of the Chrisland Schools pupils.\n\nOne Dr. Dipo Awojide said \u201cChrisland School has a duty of care for their pupils and students. They failed to enforce this on that Dubai trip. They might get sued by the parents. The state government should ensure schools have policies per duty of care and such policies should be enforced.\u201d\n\nJapheth Omojuwa Omojuwa argued: \u201cThey were in the care of the school when the incident happened. The school should take responsibility for that. In their letter to her parents, they took no responsibility whatsoever. They deserve every smoke they get,\u201d said Omojuwa.\n\nFor @AmaraRadio, the school erred by not inviting and informing the parents about the true incident. She insisted that the incident was not raped but \u201cspoilt children doing what they have done before, but this time, videoing it.\u201d\n\nChibuzo Nwa Emeagwara faulted the parents for failing to bring up their kids responsibly.\n\nDeputy National President, National Parent Teacher Association of Nigeria (NAPTAN), Chief Adeolu Ogunbanjo urged parents not to leave their responsibility in the hands of schools or teachers.\n\nThe school issued a statement last night, affirming the priorities they place on their pupils.\n\nChrisland also denied that any pupil of their was raped or had pregnancy test andimistered on her.\n\n\u2018We are proud to reassure our stakeholders that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place on our watch. For emphasis, only a COVID post travel test was conducted on the returning delegation of our students, in compliance with COVID-19 travel protocols, at the Life Centre Medical Services on March 21, 2022 at School Hall, Opebi,\u201d the statement said.",

We don\u2019t know what to do. We have sold all we ever worked for to appease these people but they want more.

The corpses were evacuated to Saint Gerald Hospital. We are trying to talk to the area commander to ensure the safe return of those who are still in captivity,\u2019 he said.\n\nIn the same vein, eight out of 20 persons that were abducted in Idon town, Kajuru LGA, have been released by their abductors after spending about two months in captivity.\n\n\u2018They were released on Sunday after ransom was paid. They said we need to bring additional ran some before they can release the remaining 12 persons.\n\n\u2018We have reported the recurrence of bandits attacks in Kajuru and Kachia to higher authority but they have not done anything concrete to stop the attacks.

That is why I have a few awards in my office or in my house, not because I was not offered, but because I hardly accept. For me, each one I accept is worth over 100 awards. This is because I believe we should only be given awards for justified reasons.\n\n\u201cWhen I received your nomination letter, I reckoned that The Sun is critical to nation-building.

Because I was in the opposition, I had a lot of information, especially when I served as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee; between 2007 and 2015.\n\n\u201cBut, within my limits, I was very conscious of what my nation demanded of me.

Under your watch, the National Assembly has ensured that the country returned to the right budget cycle.\n\n\u201cOn October 15, 2019, the Senate under your leadership passed the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill 2019.

          "text": "\u2022Military claims massive air strikes, routing insurgents in North-east\n\n\u2022They\u2019re behind banditry in Imo, says Uzodinma\n\n\u2022As Zulum attributes surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP members to divine intervention\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n\n\nFrustrated by worsening insecurity, amid wide criticism of government\u2019s inability to protect the citizenry, Minister of Defence, Maj-Gen Bashir Magashi (rtd), yesterday, called for God\u2019s intervention in the fight against insurgents and other criminal elements in the country.\n\nThe resort to divine intervention came on the heels of reported military air strikes in the North-east, which were said to have routed scores of terrorists. The terrorists had, allegedly, fired mortar bombs at civilian targets in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, recently. That was as the security situation in the country continued to deteriorate, with armed extremists striking at will, kidnapping many, and killing scores.\n\nIn Imo State, the governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said persons blaming Buhari for insecurity were the ones behind banditry in his state. Uzodimma spoke on Monday in Owerri at the wedding ceremony of Chinedu, son of business mogul and politician, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, which held at the Cathedral Church of Transfiguration of Our Lord (CATOL).\n\nIn the continuing climate of insecurity, terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), yesterday attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, killing two security personnel.\n\nHowever, breathing a sigh of relief, Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the recent mass surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters and commanders was as a result of divine intervention following prayers from all over the world.\n\nThe air interdiction in the North-east came as Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Farouk Yahaya, charged troops to sustain the tempo of attack on terrorists.\n\nThe Nigerian Army Headquarters also reported the killing of an alleged member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State by military troops.\n\nIn his Easter message, Magashi called for religious harmony in the country, and prayed for God\u2019s intervention to give the armed forces victory in their various campaigns against security threats across the country. He assured Nigerians of the military\u2019s commitment to defending the sovereignty of the country.\n\nMagashi said the Easter prayer should also focus on \u201cremembering members of the armed forces presently engaged in various campaigns, for God to grant them total victory over all threats to national peace.\u201d He prayed that this year\u2019s Easter celebration \u201cwill usher in the desired peace and prosperity as well as a complete turnaround for the Nigerian Armed Forces to clear the doubts of cynics and return sanity to the dark spots in the country.\n\n\u201cThe celebration of Easter, which coincides with fasting in the holy month of Ramadan by Muslims, is not a mere coincide, it underscores the need for religious harmony as well as portends spirituality and specialty of this auspicious times of festivities,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nHe urged the Islamic and Christian faithful to embrace peaceful coexistence and religious to make Nigeria a better country for all.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force said, after credible intelligence, it launched a devastating attack on Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters on four gun trucks at Kaffa, killing scores of the terrorists and destroying their trucks. This followed Sunday\u2019s midnight attack by insurgents on Goniri in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, where they fired mortar bombs on civilian targets, killing many civilians and injuring others,\n\nA military update said the Nigerian Air Force also scrambled additional Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location and inflict heavy casualties on ISWAP. It said the aircraft was, at the time of filling this report, still patrolling Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, to ensure that the city remained safe.\n\nSimilarly, the Chief of Army Staff, who was represented by Maj-Gen GM Mutkut, urged troops to avoid any unprofessional conduct while discharging thier duties. Farouk said the troops should redouble their efforts in order to sustain the current tempo in the fight against the insurgency.\n\nHe spoke at the Headquarters Sector 3 OP Hadin Kai and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in Monguno, Borno State, as he joined the Christian faithful and troops of both commands to celebrate this year\u2019s Easter.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Army said troops of 34 Artillery Brigade, Sunday, neutralised a member of IPOB and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN), at Ihioma community, in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\nThe army stated, \u201cTroops\u2019 on routine patrol encountered members of the irredentist group, who fired sporadically at Banana Junction to enforce the illegal sit at home order on law abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cThe IPOB/ESN criminals on sighting the troops withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma Community for reinforcement. In the firefight that ensued during the operation, one of the criminals was taken out, while others fled in disarray. Troops are combing the general area in a follow up operations to track down the fleeing dissidents.\n\n\u201cHaving suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist group has resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops complicity in their mindless atrocities. This propaganda should be disregarded in its entirety.\u201d\n\nPeople Blaming Buhari Behind Banditry, Says Uzodinma\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, took exception to the assumption that President Muhammadu Buhari should be blamed for the spate of insecurity in the state, saying those, who harbour such thoughts, are the ones behind banditry in the state.\n\nUzodinma stated that members of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state had become targets of attack by politicians and their collaborators, alleging that they are behind the banditry and killings in Imo State.\n\nSpeaking at the wedding ceremony in Owerri, Uzodimma said wicked politicians had decided to hold Imo State captive, killing innocent persons and burning public and private property in the name of politics. He urged the Church and the congregation to pray for such persons to repent.\n\nOn Sunday, while addressing the congregation at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Ozuh Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, on Easter, Uzodimma reiterated that the killings going on in the state were politically contrived. He said it was, therefore, pointless to point fingers at Buhari or the governor, as \u201csome soulless persons\u201d were wont to do.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will touch the hearts of these people, who are sponsoring the killing of innocent ones, burning houses and destroying public property in the name of politics,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said it beat his imagination that in the incident, which took place at Ogberuru in Orlu last week, all the victims \u2013 ward chairman, ward secretary and woman leader \u2013 were of the APC.\n\n\u201cI have crosschecked since the inception of this mindless blood letting in Orlu, Orsu and other communities in the zone, not one Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) person has died, their houses burnt or attacked. It is clear to me, therefore, that these killings are the handiwork of politicians who are after the APC members,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined all men of goodwill to remain fervent in their prayers for God to touch the hearts of both the sponsors of the bandits and their collaborators to come to their senses, particularly, in the light of the occasion of Easter, when Christians remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn Firefight, Terrorists Kill One Soldier, Police Officer in Borno\n\nBoko Haram and ISWAP extremists attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, and killed two security personnel.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a large number of suspected Boko Haram elements in many vehicles and motorcycles, armed with sophisticated weapons, invaded the security checkpoints manned by officers of the joint task force, Operation Hadin Kai, comprising military and men of the 30/50 Police Mobile Force (PMF).\n\nMilitary sources said sporadic gunshots rocked the area during the attack, which started about 6pm, forcing many residents of Lawanti Kura, NNPC Depot, and Molai to scamper to safety.\n\n\u201cAfter a fierce battle, one soldier, one Police Sargent, Babangida Yusuf of 50 PMF, were killed in action while one Inspector Chindo Samuel sustained injury.\n\nThe sources stated that one military gun truck and military ambulance were carted away by the terrorists. They were later burnt and abandoned as the insurgents fled on arrival of the military air support.\n\nMolai is situated along Maiduguri-Damboa- Road, which is about 10 kilometres from Maiduguri. The attack came less than 24 hours after the Islamic State spokesman, Abu Umar al-Muhajir, announced on April 17 that it would launch attacks in retaliation for the assassination of its leader.\n\nSurrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP Members is Through Divine Intervention, Says Zulum\n\nBorno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders of Boko Haram and ISWAP was a divine intervention through endless prayers from all over the world.\n\nZulum said this in his Easter message, stressing that the surrender is a miracle towards the healing of Borno State and the North-east.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mass surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders is, certainly, one of Allah\u2019s many miracles towards healing Borno State and rest of the North-east.\n\n\u201cThis mass surrender is the product of the endless prayers citizens across Borno State, the North-east region, rest of Nigeria and, indeed, the world have been offering, seeking God\u2019s intervention to heal Borno State. It is the product of immense sacrifices by the armed forces and volunteers. It is product of repeated calls by political leaders, clergies, elders and traditional rulers, asking insurgents to lay down their arms and embrace peace.\n\n\u201cWe must, therefore, be optimistic in welcoming the likely benefits of disarming, demobilising, rehabilitating and reintegrating mass-surrendered insurgents.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must welcome them without disregarding the risks associated with the programme, hence, the need to sustain stringent security profiling and other Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) procedures that can ensure the overall safety of the programme.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all citizens to fervently pray for the success of our DDR for the mass surrender of those who seek peace, and for the successes of our armed forces and volunteers in frontlines against those who insist on violence.\n\n\u201cMay God grant us enduring peace in Borno State, the North-east and rest of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nZulum added, \u201cIn over 12 years of our battles with insurgents (Boko Haram and later ISWAP) Borno State, for the first time, has a golden window that has the potential of ending the insurgency.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Discloses Addax had two extensions but failed to pay up\n\n\u2022Oil rises to $113 as Libya outages add to Russia supply fears\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, has said under his leadership, no marginal field operator would be allowed to \u201ctrade\u201d in papers issued by the organisation.\n\nKomolafe, who spoke with the Africa Oil+Gas Report, stated that the rule of law would be strictly followed in the issuance of final licences to the winners, stating that no amount of pressure would make the commission award final documents without due process.\n\nThe NUPRC boss also spoke on the Addax issue. He disclosed that when he assumed office, he reviewed the file and observed that two extensions had been granted for payment, but the company could not come up with the money until the award lapsed.\n\nMeanwhile, oil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nStating that the NUPRC \u201cwon\u2019t be arbitrary\u201d, Komolafe stressed that some of the 119 companies that had fully paid their bonuses were insisting that they could not raise funds without collecting the licences.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn many cases the moment people get a letter of award, they write to say they want to assign. Assign what? There\u2019s a phrase in law, frequently rendered in Latin: \u2018Nemo dat quod non habet\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt means \u2018You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have\u2019. For you to get an award, you have to show the proof that you can pay the signature bonus and you can finance the field development.\n\n\u201cYou get it only because you\u2019ve met the requirements. Your award would have been consummated before you can talk of assignment. We shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people making money by trading papers.\n\n\u201cIt is better you have a regulator that abides by the rule of law than to have a genius as a regulator. If you have a judge in court and he decides to rule on the basis of his ingenuity, then, it becomes a ground for appeal.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf you have such a judge, he is a problem judge; he would be abusing discretion. I am going to ensure that our rules and processes give effect to the law. Awards of acreages will be carried out on the basis of fairness, transparency and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nKomolafe, therefore, insisted that until the process was completed, no licences would be issued, stating all decisions would be taken based on strict adherence to the rules.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnyone whose licence is revoked during my tenure will not have a space to challenge. We will take a decision such that everyone challenging it will be standing on very weak ground.\n\n\u201cNow, some of the 119 companies, who have fully paid their bonuses, have formed the required Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to operate the assets.\n\n\u201cThey are asking for their licences, without which, some say, they are neither able to raise the funds for their work programmes, nor start working relationship discussions with the oil majors, who operate the leases from which the marginal fields were ring fenced.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Addax issue, Komolafe said, \u201cIf you were granted an award, it is guided by the law of contract. If you don\u2019t meet the terms, the award reverts to the original owner. It is now the obligation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to find a viable partner to operate the asset.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that the federal government would pursue vigorously the gas flare commercialisation programme, promising, \u201cI am going to rework, rejig it to finalise the work.\u201d\n\nKomolafe hoped that the process would be wrapped up before the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cIn finalising the round, we will ensure fairness, transparency and competitiveness. We are going to ensure very effective regulation that will give effect to the finest spirit of competition,\u201d he pledged.\n\nReiterating that NUPRC was in the process of developing regulations for the activation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NUPRC helmsman noted that the law must be given effect by regulations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere will be public hearings of the regulator, just as you have public hearings for the law making, you must also have public hearings for the regulations of the law. You must have the stakeholders\u2019 hearings.\u201d\n\nKomolafe explained that the PIA provided robustly for abandonment, host community and award of acreages, but argued that it could not be given effect until the entire process was consummated.\n\nOn how he intended to tackle the challenges, Komolafe said, \u201cI came with a revolutionary mind-set. I am a unique person in the industry, going by my background. I intend to do things differently in terms of adhering to processes.\u201d\n\nOil Rises to $113 as Libya Outages Add to Russia Supply Fears\n\nOil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nAdding to supply pressures from sanctions on Russia, Libya\u2019s National Oil Corp on warned that, \u201ca painful wave of closures\u201d had begun hitting its facilities and declared force majeure at Al-Sharara oilfield and other sites.\n\n\u201cWith global supplies now so tight, even the most minor disruption is likely to have an outsized impact on prices,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at brokerage OANDA.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, rose $1.37, or 1.2 per cent, to $113.07 at 1332 GMT, not far from the highest since March 30 of $113.80 hit earlier in the session. United States West Texas Intermediate gained $1.48, or 1.4 per cent, to $108.43.\n\nThe Libyan developments offset concern about demand in China, where the economy slowed in March, taking the shine off first-quarter growth numbers and worsening an outlook already weakened by COVID-19 curbs.\n\n\u201cSome Asian investors booked profits as they became worried about slowing demand in China,\u201d said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.\n\nData showed China refined two per cent less oil in March than a year earlier, with throughput falling to the lowest since October as the surge in crude prices squeezed margins and tight lockdowns hurt demand.\n\nIn March, oil surged to the highest since 2008, with Brent briefly topping $134.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that there were concerns of deeper supply losses looming as Russian production declined by 7.5 per cent in the first half of April from March and EU governments said last week the bloc\u2019s executive was drafting proposals to ban Russian crude.\n\nThose comments came before an escalation in the Ukraine war. Ukrainian authorities said missiles struck Lviv early on Monday and explosions rocked other cities as Russian forces kept up their bombardments after claiming near full control of the port of Mariupol.\n\nAuthorities claimed tribal leaders in southern Libya had shut down the county\u2019s largest oil field \u2014 the latest closure of an oil facility amid a bitter standoff between two rival governments.\n\nOil production at the Sharara field has been stopped and the state-run National Oil Corporation declared force majeure at the field, which produced around 450,000 barrels a day.\n\nForce majeure is a legal manoeuvre that enables a company to get out of its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe corporation called the shutdown of the field an \u201cabsurd move\u201d that mirrored the ongoing standoff in the country. The closure would likely create a fuel crisis in the oil-rich country, as the field was one of the main sources of domestic fuel.\n\nThe corporation did not name those people behind the closure, but its announcement came a few hours after tribal leaders in the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometres (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, said they shut down the field in protest against the government of embattled Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.\n\nThey called for Tripoli-based Dbeibah to hand over power to the government of Prime Minister Fathi Bashagha, who was appointed by the parliament in February to lead a transitional administration after Libya failed to hold its first presidential election in December.\n\nLocal media also reported that residents in the south-eastern district of Whahat announced the closure of all oil facilities in their area, also to pressure Dbeibah to step aside.\n\nOver the weekend, tribal leaders and protesters shut down the al-Feel field and the Zueitina terminal on the Gulf of Sirte, forcing the national oil company to declare force majeure at the two facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Funmi Ogundare\n\nThe management of Chrisland schools has explained why it had to suspend some students over a sex tape which went viral on social media.Some students from the private school located in Victoria Garden City, who were in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for the World School Games in March were involved in immoral acts in a trending video on social media.\n\n\n\nThis school\u2019s explanation is coming after the Lagos State government ordered that all branches of the school in the state be shut down.Surprisingly, the school was silent on the action taken against the staff members in whose care the children were at the time of the incident during the trip to Dubai The management had earlier suspended an 11-year-old female pupil said to have been gang raped, claiming that the girl took part in a truth-or-dare game in Dubai where the students represented the school in the World School Games between March 8 and 14, 2022.The school announced the girl\u2019s suspension in a letter to her parent, describing her conduct as improper behaviour.However, the mother of the girl has called on Nigerians to help her seek justice for her daughter, whom she said the school was trying to silence her daughter in order to cover up the immoral incident.\n\n\n\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY on Monday, a member, Advisory Board of the school, Mr. Akin Fadeyi, said it was scandalised and distressed over the issue, adding that it meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. He added that it was also to caution students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences. According to him, \u201cThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform or children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cThe school, he noted, had taken a critical view of the number of students who participated in this trip to Dubai and who did the school proud in its quest to expand the horizons of its students holistically through global exposure, adding that it takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements. Of the 76 children who represented Chrisland, Fadeyi said 71 ensured an untainted adherence to its standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. \u201cWithin these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and boys on the fourth floor, to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands.\u201dFadeyi reassured that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place under its watch saying, \u201cwhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Urges South-east to focus on \u2018what can\u2019t lie\u2019\n\n*Says tales about marabouts predicting his presidency surprising\n\n*Kukah to Buhari: You have divided Nigerians along ethnic, religion, regional lines\n\n\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nFormer vice president and presidential hopeful in the 2023 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, at the weekend, said what Nigeria needed after seven years of ineptitude of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was a leader who could bring together diversity in unity and encourage the people to respect and accept each other, despite their differences. Atiku said Nigeria needed a \u201cunifier, not a pacifier\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe spoke exclusively to THISDAY in the first of a presidential interview series being conducted by this newspaper.\n\nThis was just as the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, yesterday accused the Buhari\u2019s administration of having, \u201cdivided our people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that we have never witnessed in our history.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe former vice president further reacted to the issue of zoning, saying the South-east should focus on what cannot lie, that is his record, \u201cMy attitude towards them. My history with them.\u201d\n\nHe did not miss an opportunity to sell his candidacy and vision, but dismissed tales about marabouts predicting he would be president someday as the reason he had held on to the dream tenaciously. He said the story remained a surprise to him, too.\n\n\n\nSpeaking directly to some of the issues defining the state of the nation on the journey to 2023, Atiku said, \u201cI think after seven years of incompetence, Nigerians just want competence. Where it comes from, they do not mind.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that we face today have so focused us on the need to elect leaders based on their competence, instead of their region or religion. Nigeria needs a unifier, not a pacifier. We will be pacified by unity. We will not be united by pacification.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn insinuations about a groundswell of opinion against his recurrent presidential bids, especially suggestions that the people might be tired of seeing his face on the ballot, Atiku said, \u201cThat is a fallacy. There is no groundswell, to use your word. Yes, there are people who have large megaphones, but they do not constitute a groundswell.\n\n\u201cSome of these people have emotional and historic reasons for making their appeals, and one must be sensitive to them. That is why I have gone round and keep going round this country to consult. I believe in the politics of addition. I am not a subtracting politician.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the mounting sentiments in favour of a Nigerian president of South-east origin in 2023, he stated, \u201cOf course it is in order. Have you forgotten how passionate I have been in advocating for the South-east? Look at my record.\n\n\u201cWhat the South-east has to understand is that people\u2019s records matter more than people\u2019s rhetoric. I ask my beloved people of the South-east to focus on what cannot lie; my record. My attitude towards them. My history with them.\u201d\n\n\n\nDismissing speculations that marabouts played a role in his presidential aspiration, Atiku said, \u201cEven me, I am surprised when people bandy about these types of beer parlour myths. I am a devout Muslim. My principles do not allow for anything other than total submission to the will of God.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is a myth put together by my political opponents to achieve whatever ends they wanted to achieve. That is just like saying Reagan and Churchill kept trying multiple times because they were powered by soothsayers. It may interest you to know that I became governor after four attempts. Tenacity is a virtue. It is not a vice. It should be celebrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nTalking about moves for consensus approach in selecting the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) , Atiku contended, \u201cI just believe that no man should be a judge in his own case. Let\u2019s go down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2010-2011, the North chose to go that route. However, it was not the aspirants who elected on their own to come up with a consensus candidate. It was the region. Specifically, the Northern Political Leaders\u2019 Forum led by the late Malam Adamu Ciroma.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the North as a region wants that option, then, it should be driven by our natural leaders and elders. It should not be promoted by partisans. Once it becomes like that, then, it may become a poisoned chalice.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing the issue if zoning, Atiku said, \u201cI will add this: the Peoples Democratic Party, of which I am a founding member, should focus on winning, not on zoning!\u201d\n\n\n\nOn why he still wanted to be president of Nigeria after five \u201cfailed attempts\u201d, he said, \u201cPlease, allow me the liberty of rephrasing your question. I would rather say, after several attempts. They were not failed attempts, as I have already explained above.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the year 2022, Nigeria is the world headquarters for extreme poverty, and the third most insecure nation in the world. Our economy is not growing, while our population is expanding.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you now look at my record in government, where under the leadership of President Obasanjo, I was the chairman of the National Council on Privatisation, and a coordinator of our economic management team, you can clearly see my achievements.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose achievements need to be replicated if we are to turn the tide. In fact, it is almost as if providence thrust me out this time to do again what God had enabled me to do before.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe provided jobs. Nigerians are now unemployed in record numbers. We paid off Nigeria\u2019s foreign debt. Nigeria is now more indebted than at any time in our history. Through our policies and inclusiveness, we had relative peace.\n\n\u201cNow, Nigeria is in crisis due to insecurity. It would look to me that my curriculum vitae or my resume appears tailor-made to address the challenges we now face as a nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAtiku spoke on the corruption allegations against him, saying, \u201cThank God you said allegations. Anybody can allege. You know the history of this country and what specifically I went through. All that is now in the past. What I will say, however, is that I am the most investigated politician in Nigeria; yet, nothing has been established against me. I have received a clean bill of health with regard to the allegations raised against me.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat alone should tell you something. It speaks volumes. In the attempt to stop me, knowing that my plans are sound, my ideology is solid and stable, and my connection to Nigerians is enduring, the only thing that my political opponents could use against me are false allegations. My only answer to that is that I have judicially been exonerated and vindicated of all of them.\u201d\n\n\n\nKukah to Buhari: You Have Divided Nigerians Along Ethnic, Religion, Regional Lines\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Kukah, in his Easter Message to the Church and Nigerians, made available to THISDAY, said the problems and challenges currently facing Nigeria were beyond the 2023 elections.\n\nHe lamented that the government had made Nigerians vulnerable and, \u201cignited the most divisive form of identity consciousness among the people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe years of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping. Notwithstanding these challenges, religious leader must recover to deploy their moral authority and avoid falling victims to the schemes of politicians and their material enticements,\u201d the Catholic Bishop said.\n\n\n\nHe disclosed that the values of interfaith dialogue have come under severe strain and pressure, \u201cwith extremists from both sides of our faiths denigrating the idea of dialogue with their counterparts of other faiths.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnorance and miseducation have combined with prejudice to create the falsehood that somehow, one religion is superior to the others.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith so many ill equipped fraudsters posing as religious leaders, there is an obsession with defaming the others and widening our differences,\u201d Kukah added.\n\n\n\nHe said religious leaders must face the reality, \u201cthat here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam. While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful who are marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the last few years, we have had some good news from outside the shores of Nigeria. The most noteworthy is the initiative undertaken by both Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, Egypt, Shaikh Mohammed Al-Tayeb in 2019, when both of them met and signed the Document on Human Fraternity.\n\n\n\n\u201cPope Francis followed up with the publication of an Encyclical titled, \u2018Fratelli Tutti, We are all Brothers,\u2019 in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe following year, the United Nation\u2019s General Assembly declared February 4, World Day of Fraternity. Both leaders agreed that: \u2018We need to develop the awareness that nowadays, we are either all saved together or no one is saved. Poverty, decadence, and suffering in one part of the earth are a silent breeding ground for problems that will end up affecting our entire planet.\u201d\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Kukah said, \u201cWe need to start thinking of a Nigeria beyond banditry and kidnapping and the endless circles of violence that have engulfed our communities and nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to pretend that there are no religious undertones to the violence in the name of God that has given our religions a bad name. The way out is for the state to enforce the secular status of the Nigerian state so as to give citizens the necessary freedoms from the shackles of semi-feudal confusion over the status of religion and the state in a plural democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must be ready to embrace modernity and work out how to preserve our religions and cultures without turning religion into a tool for tyranny, exclusion, and oppression.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe maintained that, \u201cin finding our way forward, the President must concede that it is within his powers to decide how we are going to end the war that has engulfed and is tearing down our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems that the federal government has shown far greater commitment to integrating so called repentant terrorists than getting our children back from kidnappers or keeping our universities open. Earlier last month, Operation Safe Corridor announced that it had graduated 599 members of various terrorist groups who have acquired new skills and are now ready to be integrated into society.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total comes to over a thousand now. It is plausible to note that the programme involves pyscho-social support, rehabilitation, vocational training, skill acquisition and start-ups.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite all these, the larger issue is that their various communities have expressed their reluctance to receive their erring sons back. Nigerians have no access to the transcripts of the texts of the confessions of these terrorists not to talk of evidence of their commitment to not sin again.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have only the words of the terrorists and the same military that they have been fighting a war with. It speaks volumes when the President and his military hierarchy choose to believe these young men who took up arms and for years waged war against their country, killed, maimed and wasted thousands of lives, destroyed entire communities and now, they are being housed, fed, clothed with public funds,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kukah, \u201call this while their victims have been forced to make the various IDP camps their new homes! Where is the justice for the victims and the rest of the country they have destroyed.\u201d\n\nHe said as a priest, he cannot be against a repentant sinner or criminals changing their ways, noting that, \u201cafter all, the doors of forgiveness must always remain open.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, in this case, Nigerians have very little information as to the entire rehabilitation processes.\n\n\u201cHave these terrorists felt the heat or have they seen the light or, is their repentance a mere strategic and tactical repositioning? So far, we have no evidence that these terrorists have been able to confront their victims not to talk of seeking forgiveness from them. Something is wrong. We see these terrorists adorned in our national colours in their green and white kaftans, trousers, and looking like heroes of the state!\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we to assume that they have become acknowledged models for Nigerian youth? Perhaps the next graduating set might be treated to Presidential handshakes, receptions at the villa with full national colours.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the unfolding event have vindicated his criticism of this government, saying that last week, in solidarity with him, the Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam, JNI, in a statement stated that: \u2018It appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it.\n\n\n\n\u201cAny government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place\u2026.our humanity is being eroded and that erosion is become a new normal.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition, Kukah pointed out that the Northern Elders Forum and the House of Representatives recently called on the president to resign since, in their view it was now clear that he cannot protect his citizens.\n\n\u201cThis has come three years after the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Statement issued on April 26th, 2018 made the same call that was greeted with cynicism,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nThe cleric stated further that the challenge of fixing, \u201cthis broken nation is enormous and, as I have said, requires joint efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWith everything literally broken down, our country has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy. Our individual hearts are broken; our family dreams are broken; homes are broken; churches, mosques, infrastructure are broken.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur educational system is broken; our children\u2019s lives and future are broken; our politics is broken; our economy is broken; our energy system is broken; our security system is broken; our roads and rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bishop, \u201cas 2023 beckons and the stage is set, the next president of Nigeria must be a man or woman with a heart, a sense of empathy and a soul on fire that can set limits to what human indignities visited on citizens that he or she can tolerate.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have no need for any further empty messianic rhetoric laced with deceitful and grandiose religiosity. We need someone who can fix our broken nation, rid our people of the looming dangers of hunger and destitution.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur presidential aspirants must show evidence from their legacies and antecedents that they know the country well enough and its severe wounds. Whoever wants to govern us must illustrate that he or she understands what is on ground.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe thanked the president for accepting the report of the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy and granting pardon to over 150 Nigerians serving various terms of imprisonment.\n\nHowever, Kukah noted that more serious challenge was to immediately free all innocent Nigerians who are held captive and whose only crime was that they are living in Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Bishop congratulated Christians, saying the Easter celebration brings hope and restoration.\n\nHe further explained that Easter was a fulfilment of what the Jesus Christ had foretold when he said, \u201cunless a grain of wheat falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain, but if it dies, it bears much fruit.\u201d\n\nKukah stressed that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to the Christian faith.\n\n\n\nHe noted that the greatest challenges facing the country was how to begin a processes of reconstructing, \u201cour nation hoping on and to survive the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real challenge before us now is to look beyond politics and face the challenge of forming characters, faith in our country that many have lost confidence in,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The presidency has said before the Super Tucano jets acquired from the United States can be deployed in the banditry-ravaged North West, the terms of agreement for the purchase of the aircraft need to be amended so that Nigeria will not be in the \u201cblack book\u201d of the US.\n\nNorth-West Nigeria comprises seven states; namely, Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Kano and Jigawa states.\n\n\u201cThe military is a trained military. The president is responsible. If he finishes now, we want him to go and rest in Kaduna or Daura; we don\u2019t want him to go to the International Criminal Court; that is not the idea. We should allow the military to use their methodical process for dealing with these things, let them do it.\n\n\u201cWhen you are dealing with countries like America, you have to be sensitive to public opinion which is important to them as it is to us. Yes, it is clear when they sold the Super Tucano to the government of Nigeria. They were looking at the law.\n\n\u201cThe law does not allow you to use weapons on targets they classify as civilians otherwise America will no longer sell weapons to you. Don\u2019t forget that it took a buildup of years of rejection until President Buhari came in the scene and was able to establish credibility with America and they said they would sell.\n\n\u201cIt is true that from the beginning, the Air Force could not use the aircraft in the North West and even after that, it took some time because these things also use precision type weapon. From my own understanding, these were not to be made available until March, we are just into April,\u201d presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu told Trust TV.\n\nOn what the government is doing to rescue to the abducted Abuja-Kaduna train passengers, Shehu noted that the military has the capacity to bomb the enclave of the bandits if it wishes, but the determination to rescue them alive is preventing the government from engaging in any military actions.\n\nHe said the government was also making heavy investments in drone technology, stating that \u201cquite a lot is being achieved with the drones.\u201d\n\nHe said the Abuja-Kaduna train service was ready for resumption after the recent attack, \u201cbut with air protection by the Nigerian Air Force pending the time when the appropriate technology is acquired for the rail.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesperson said the train operations were suspended in order not to be insensitive to the families of the victims.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Editorial Statement from TechCabal",
          "text": "Since 2013, TechCabal, the flagship publication of Big Cabal Media, has told stories about Africa\u2019s startup ecosystem. In January 2021, we launched TechCabal 3.0, broadening our mission to tell stories beyond startups to cover the full breadth of technology\u2019s impact on the continent. With TC 3.0, we capture the players, human impact, and business of technology in Africa, covering startups and big technology players, local and international; innovators, regulators, and everything in\u2013between. TechCabal aims to provide the reporting, content, context, events, data, and stories that show the world how tech is changing Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold mission and one that\u2019s in its early days. Great media businesses take time to build, and high-impact newsrooms require extensive resources to get right. To ensure we have the resources to build a business with impact and longevity, we have focused on business model innovation, developing a profitable, high-growth media business that has attracted attention from local and international investors.\n\nThere is a tension that has always existed in media businesses between the rigour and objectivity required for outstanding journalism and the business demands of keeping those media businesses properly funded. That tension is particularly enhanced in the case of a publication like TechCabal which is funded through advertising, sponsorship, and other means, by players within the same industry that it covers. We hire talent from a similarly limited pool, and are supported by those within the industry who believe in our vision and promise not just as a publisher but also as a business.\n\nA recent example of this tension has surfaced in our coverage of allegations against Flutterwave, one of the largest and most important startups in Africa. Flutterwave is an advertiser with TechCabal and a sponsor of some of our properties. Future Africa, which Iyin Aboyeji (Flutterwave co-founder and former CEO) leads, and Gbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, are investors in Big Cabal Media, the parent company of TechCabal. Additionally, Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor and Acting Editor-in-Chief of TechCabal, previously worked at Flutterwave. This tangle of relationships is unsurprising given that TechCabal, and Big Cabal Media, operate within the same tech industry that we cover. To be clear, TechCabal will cover the Flutterwave story or stories that involve any other partners of ours, present and future, with the same thoroughness that we cover any other stories.\n\nAs the best publications globally do, when these conflicts occur, we declare them to our audience so they are well aware of major relationships that may come to bear on our coverage of a story. You may have seen such notifications on our Bento Africa expos\u00e9 and other stories. We may occasionally recuse an employee from working on a particular story because they are too close to the subject.\n\nIn our coverage of Flutterwave\u2019s story, TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor and Acting Editor-in-Chief Koromone Koroye has recused herself from all coverage and editorial work on related stories. Editorial direction on these stories is being led by our Features Editor Tamerra Griffin, and Senior Editor Kelechi Njoku. In working on projects like this, we are able to go as far as creating walled-off internal teams and making decisions independent of the rest of the newsroom to work on a story or project.\n\nBeyond declarations of conflict, recusement of key personnel from certain stories, and other such processes, it is our goal to tell every story with the same amount of rigour, even those stories that involve entities or people that we are, in other ways, engaged with. We are fundamentally optimistic about the promise of technology to be one of the biggest drivers of change in Africa over the next few decades. However, that promise will not be fulfilled if the same bad habits that hold our countries and economies back are perpetuated in this burgeoning arena. As a publication, we are obliged to treat stories of wrongdoing with the same high level of attention and rigour as we do stories that celebrate milestones, examine business models and challenges or showcase key players.\n\nThe first obligation of good journalism is a search for the truth. Decent journalists and newsrooms the world over hold themselves to high standards of journalistic integrity, as the press holds real power that must be wielded with a sense of responsibility. Key among the journalistic principles we hold dear are:\n\nproper verification or cross-corroboration of claims ahead of publishing offering all involved parties the right of reply and correction respecting the identity and rights of sources, providing anonymity for vulnerable sources; and respecting the rights of victims to privacy and to tell or not tell their stories, as they wish\n\nIt is important to note that great reporting takes time and care, a standard we do not intend to compromise. We hold a responsibility to the public, our audiences, and all our other stakeholders to be bold, rigorous, and uphold the highest standards as we work to build the most important publication covering the business and impact of technology in Africa.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nShare this article\n\nEditorial TechCabal Editorial Team",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The vacation is over, and it\u2019s time to get back to work or return to school. If you are a Nigerian student in a public university, you\u2019re probably reconsidering your life because, ASUU\u2026\n\nUnrelated, but I\u2019d like to remind you that you matter, no matter what\u2019s going on in your country or on the continent.\n\nFor example, it is no news that Nigeria and other African countries like Ghana struggle with fluctuating inflation rates. This alone has led to a hike in food prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering that Nigeria is the world\u2019s poverty capital, it\u2019s no surprise that things are becoming increasingly difficult daily.\n\nNonetheless, do well to take care of yourself. As my Nigerian people say, \u201cproblem no dey finish.\u201d It never ends.\n\nLearn to enjoy yourself once in a while. There\u2019s no universal definition of what it means to have fun. So, buy that food, binge that show, or hang out with that friend whenever you have time.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t want to stress you out today, so I\u2019ll be discussing two stories.\n\nToday\u2019s gist:\n\nIs NFT an enigma?\n\nUnion54 to launch credit schemes\n\nIs NFT an enigma?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with NFT\n\nDo you remember last week\u2019s story about how NFT is the new oil? The Ghanaian pallbearer NFT meme story? Yeah, that one!\n\nRaymond\u2019s \u2014 a subscriber after my own heart \u2014 response: \u201cNFT is the new oil, really? Ask Jack Dorsey. Lol.\u201d\n\nIf you understand the real gist, you\u2019ll know that he was being sarcastic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Recall that in March 2021, Sina Estavi, CEO of Bridge Oracle \u2014 a public oracle system on the Tron network \u2014 made headlines when he paid $2.9 million for an NFT of Jack Dorsey\u2019s (former Twitter CEO) first tweet.\n\nA few days later, in a tweet, he compared Dorsey\u2019s tweet to the Mona Lisa painting, saying people would realise the true value of the tweet years later.\n\nFast forward to April 5, 2022, Estavi announced in a tweet that he was selling \u201cthe world\u2019s first-ever tweet\u201d for 14,969 ether (over $48 million) and would donate half of the proceeds ($25 million or more) to charity.\n\nWhat happened after listing? He received seven bids ranging from $6 to $277. No, I\u2019m not joking. The highest bid he received was $277!\n\nHaha! Well, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s all I felt when I saw the news. I didn\u2019t know what to think or say. What is this NFT again because I don\u2019t understand it anymore?\n\nBolu \u2014 our go-to Blockchain person \u2014 is always coming through for not just me but us. How? In today\u2019s episode of Techpoint Africa Podcast, he said some things which you\u2019d enjoy listening to, including the train wreck that was his first NFT experience. Trust me, it\u2019s the shortest podcast we\u2019ve ever recorded. Kindly listen to it here.\n\nEntering the NFT market without knowing the fundamentals is a recipe for disaster. I mean, if this could happen to a crypto entrepreneur, Estavi, and our blockchain-go-to person, Bolu, a novice like me should try to understand the market and know how it\u2019s being run.\n\nAnd that is why we\u2019ve organised the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, which will take place on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos. You will not only learn the fundamentals, but you could also learn how to make a career out of it.\n\nHow can you register? Kindly visit and share this link with everyone you like or don\u2019t like. I\u2019m all about freewill \ud83d\ude09\n\nHowever, bids for the Dorsey-tweet NFT have risen to around $10,000 in the last few days. Estavi claims he will not sell for less than $50 million.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

It\u2019s an extension because, in November 2021, the startup announced a $3 million seed investment.\n\nTiger Global led this round with Vibe VC, Earl Grey Capital, and Packy McCormick\u2019s Not Boring Capital participating.\n\nLaunched by Perseus Mlambo (CEO) in 2021, Union54\u2019s API enables African software companies to issue and manage debit cards without the assistance of a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe company claims it has issued slightly more than 500,000 virtual debit cards to its customers since its October launch. It also participated in Y Combinator\u2019s summer batch 2021.\n\nBesides that, Mlambo says they have customers from all over Africa, and based on several interactions with them, they\u2019ve identified some of the most pressing issues they face. They include longer settlement times for card transactions and difficulty sourcing funds. So, they intend to develop a card scheme to address this issue.\n\nWhat are card schemes? They are payment networks linked to payment cards like debit and credit cards. Examples of these are Union Pay, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nUnion54\u2019s goal is to be a local alternative to Mastercard and Visa and assist merchants with settlement and sourcing issues. Consequently, the company plans to launch this framework with nine central banks by the end of the year, with a pilot scheduled for Q2 2023.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "The average cost of making a pot of Jollof rice, a popular Nigerian delicacy for a family of five rose by 7.3 percent to N8,595 in Q1 (Jan-Mar) 2022 from N8,008 in Q3 (Jul-Sep) last year, the latest Jollof Index report released Tuesday shows.\n\nThe Jollof index report published by SBM Intelligence, an Africa focused geopolitical research and strategic communications consulting firm attributed the increase to issues such as high cost of diesel, petrol scarcity and heightened insecurity.\n\n\u201cPetrol prices typically have a knock-on effect on the cost of transportation and food storage, especially for products like turkey given Nigeria\u2019s precarious power situation which forces pretty much every business to run on expensive petrol or diesel generators,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt also added that animal protein sources like turkey and beef accounted for the increase in most of the states in February and March, making it difficult for many families to afford protein in their meals as they are now more concerned about food quantity, than food quality or dietary requirements.\n\nThe SBM Jollof Index is a composite index that tracks how much it costs to make a pot of Jollof rice across 13 markets in nine states in the six geopolitical zones for a family of five or six, the average rural and urban family size in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: Why more than half of Nigerians face food insecurity\n\nThe commodities that make up the index are rice, groundnut oil, chicken or turkey, beef, seasoning, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions. While the index has treaded close to food inflation since collection began in 2016, it has provided a simple way of communicating the realities of inflation to the Nigerian public.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, food inflation (prices) increased to 17.2 percent in March as against 17.1 percent in the previous month. The increase, which is the first rise since December 2021 was a result of the increase in the price of diesel from about N288 per litre in January to over N700 by the end of March, caused by the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nDiesel has a stronghold on Nigeria as it powers a large part of the industrial and commercial activities in the economy, from the trucks used for long-distance haulage of both industrial and finished goods, to small machines used by small-scale enterprises. Cold rooms used to preserve foods and drinks also run on diesel.\n\nImu Ismaila, a petty trader who deals in frozen fish and chicken said she has lost nearly N100, 000 since the power failure that has lasted for several weeks and has refused to improve. In addition to her loss, she said the cost of preserving her goods has increased, due to the high diesel cost forcing her to increase the price of her wares.\n\nA business survey across some markets in Lagos shows that over the past three weeks, the price for a kilo of turkey rose to N3,200 from N2,700, a kilo of chicken increased to N2,000 from N1,500 and a kilo of Titus fish is N2,000 from N1,700.\n\n\u201cBeef, chicken, and fish have become so costly these days. I am not even talking about turkey, I removed that one from my menu a long time ago, and now that everybody wants to add egg, it has gone up too,\u201d One of the respondents interviewed by SBM said.\n\nLikewise, another respondent who is a meat seller described what he has noticed recently that people are abandoning beef for cheaper parts such as intestines, and other innards in a bid to save cost.\n\nThe report also highlighted that across the states surveyed, it cost the most to make a pot of Jollof rice in Wuse II, Abuja at N10,900 while Bayside Mbakpa in Calabar accounts for the lowest cost at N6,840.\n\n\u201cWe can only imagine how many more Nigerians will be faced with a food crisis by the end of the year if there are no actionable steps to tackle the already daunting challenges,\u201d analysts at SBM warned.",

          "text": "The total revenue collected by electricity distribution companies (DisCos) in Nigeria from their customers increased the most last year since the power sector was privatised, buoyed by the hikes in tariffs.\n\nThe DisCos and the generation companies (GenCos) unbundled from the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria were privatised in 2013 and handed over to the core investors on Nov. 1 of that year, while the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has remained under government ownership.\n\nData obtained by BusinessDay from the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED), the umbrella body for the Discos, showed that the revenue collected by them surged by 46.6 percent to N757 billion in 2021.\n\n\u201cDisCos have benefitted from the tariff increases since November 2020 and have even improved the collection efficiency from an average of 67 percent to 69 percent in 2021,\u201d ANED said in a report.\n\nIt attributed the revenue growth in the Nigerian electricity supply industry (NESI) to the implementation of the service-reflective tariff in November 2020; the 4.9 percent increase in energy delivered to the market; and better performance on the aggregate technical, commercial and collection (ATC&C) losses.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to notice much improvement in electricity supply condition across the country even when DisCos are experiencing increased revenue collection,\u201d Chijioke James, president of Electricity Consumers Association of Nigeria, told BusinessDay.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 3,089.3MW as of 6:00 am on Monday, down from 4,311.1MW at the start of the month, according to data from the Nigerian Electricity System Operator. The national grid, which is managed by the TCN, suffered another collapse on April 8, the first this month and the third in 24 days, worsening power supply in many parts of the country.\n\nAccording to the DisCos, the cost-reflective average tariff, which allows them to recover the cost of service, decreased by N5/kWh between 2019 and 2021 and continues to decrease in 2022, weakening their balance sheets even more.\n\nThey said the Nov. 2020 tariff review, which removed subsidies for customers in bands A, B and C, increased the revenue billed by 44 percent, making its naira equivalent reach over N1 trillion for the first time.\n\nUnder the service-based tariff arrangement introduced in 2020, customers are categorised into maximum demand and non-maximum demand customers, with different bands (A to E) depending on the level of supply.\n\nThe power distributors said the energy received last year increased to 29,629 GWh from 28,249 GWh in 2020 while the energy billed rose to 22,939 GWh (equivalent to N1.3 trillion) from 21,485 GWh (equivalent to N764 billion).\n\n\u201cThe daily energy sent out by the GenCos and wheeled by TCN in 2021 was on average 99,186 MWh (4,133 MW), which is about only 4.9 percent increase from 2020 (3,984 MW) and very insufficient to cover the huge unsuppressed demand in Nigeria,\u201d they said.\n\nRead also: Buyers of power infrastructure lack technical, financial competence \u2013 Nnaji\n\nThe number of customers rose to 10,056,285 last year from 9,957,571 in 2020.\n\nANED said, \u201cWith the effective implementation of the service-based tariff in November 2020, the Federal Government removed electricity subsidies (over N500 billion) for the better service customer categories (Class A, B and C) and, therefore, the allowed tariff has increased from N31/kWh up to N49/kWh in 12 months.\n\n\u201cThis fact, together with the DisCos\u2019 ATC&C losses recovery in 2021, disproves the paradigm that an increase in tariffs leads to an increase in losses.\u201d\n\nIt, however, said that while the industry\u2019s cost of service grew from N1.15 trillion in 2019 to N1.8 trillion in 2021, the cost-reflective tariff in 2021 was N5/kWh cheaper than in 2019.\n\n\u201cIt truly doesn\u2019t make any sense that while the generation cost and other costs continue to grow at NESI, the cost-reflective tariff is systematically and artificially reduced,\u201d the DisCos said.\n\nAccording to the report, DisCos are not able to recover the cost of service as the real ATC&C losses are much higher than that under the Multi-Year Tariff Order.\n\n\u201cThis fact is exacerbating DisCos liquidity crisis and cash stress, weakening DisCos\u2019 balance sheets and preventing access to funding, ultimately impeding DisCo performance improvement. Thus, raising the question of whether there can be future DisCo improvement if the situation currently precludes any major investment in NESI,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to the DisCos, under MYTO 2020, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission is projecting that the daily energy sent out should be around 126,000 MWh/day,\n\nThe target \u201cis not feasible and is inconsistent with NESI\u2019s historical power supply trend,\u201d ANED said. \u201cThis paradox will artificially reduce the cost-reflective tariff, creating a shortfall that increases NESI\u2019s liquidity crisis,\u201d it added.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s drive to achieve 100 percent local sourcing of raw materials through partnership with local producers and backward integration activities and reduce the heavy reliance on the global supply chain, especially by firms in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, is threatened by the rising insecurity in the country, experts have said.\n\nThe growing insecurity in the country in recent years has affected agricultural activities, which most FMCG firms benefit from, as many farmers had to abandon their farmlands on the back of kidnapping, banditry, herder-farmer conflicts, terrorism and other insecurity challenges in major crops-producing states.\n\nThe Manufacturers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (MAN), in its Manufacturer\u2019s CEOs Confidence Index for the second quarter of 2021, said 42 percent of the manufacturers surveyed said local sourcing of raw materials in the sector had not improved.\n\nThe MAN data showed that local raw materials utilisation in the manufacturing sector declined year on year by 9.2 percent from an average of 58.4 points in the first half of 2020 to 53 percent in the same period of 2021.\n\nMuda Yusuf, chief executive officer of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, said insecurity in some parts of the country was posing a major threat to fostering local sourcing of raw material as well as the backward integration plan of the Federal Government despite huge investments made and the commitments of companies.\n\n\u201cAccess to location is becoming more risky and it is affecting the kind of output anticipated, especially from the agro-allied sector, and it is putting a lot of pressure on companies in the FMCG industry because if they cannot get raw materials locally, they will continually rely on imports despite the unfavourable FX situation and current supply gap,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Jide Babatope, a Lagos-based analyst, the chances of sourcing local raw material sourcing are slim as insecurity is becoming more intense especially in the North, where most raw materials are sourced.\n\n\u201cThe thing is these companies have an alternative, which is imports; it is just more expensive. Another thing they can do is look to the other parts of the country to source these inputs; however, some of it may not be available or it is produced in lower quantities,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent years, insecurity in Nigeria has worsened, especially in the northern part of the country, with data from the Global Terrorism Index showing Nigeria as the third most terrorised country in the world, after Afghanistan and Iraq, with record terror-related deaths estimated at 1,245 in 2019 and 1,606 in 2020.\n\nData from the 2021 Economic Value of Peace report by the Institute for Economics and Peace shows that the cost of violence in Nigeria was $1.34 trillion from 2007 to 2019.\n\n\u201cFirst, general insecurity is affecting the ability of farmers to produce commodities and distribute it to the market, some of which are these companies; it affects the production process and they are forced to explore alternative options,\u201d Abiola Gbemisola, assistant manager, equity research at FBN Quest, said.\n\nAccording to him, as the rising insecurity takes a toll on local raw material sourcing and backward integration activities of these companies, it will cause a ripple effect, which includes an increase in unemployment as the local supply chain suffers.\n\nThe Nigerian government is interested in the local sourcing of raw materials by companies so as to sustain favourable foreign exchange, boost local capacity, create jobs, enhance skill acquisition and reduce the importation of raw materials.\n\nSome of the efforts channelled towards this include the implementation of resource-based industrialisation and backward integration policy contained in Nigeria\u2019s Industrial Revolution Plan, forex restriction on some items by the Central Bank of Nigeria, and border closure.\n\nOne of the companies actively engaged in backward integration activities include Nestle Nigeria Plc, which sources 80 percent of its maize, sorghum, millet, soya, cassava starch, cocoa powder, and palm olein from more than 41,600 local farmers and processors scattered across the country and has over 30,000 farmers who supply 100 percent of the grain requirement for Golden Morn Maize, one of its products.\n\nDangote Sugar Refinery Plc is pumping millions of dollars into sugarcane plantations across northern states to enable it to cut raw sugar imports. The sugar maker\u2019s $ 700 million project in Nasarawa State is expected to enable its plant in the state to produce 450,000 metric tons and generate 90 megawatts of power annually when completed.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s insecurity woes worsening\n\nMany manufacturers are also working with their local suppliers, providing them with funding, technical support and market.\n\nGuinness Nigeria Plc is supporting over 30,000 smallholder farmers, who supply it with sorghum, to enable them to move from basic to more efficient and productive yields.\n\nOther than partnering with local suppliers of raw materials, some FMCG firms have pumped over $1 billion into land acquisition, nursery plantation and acquisition of expensive equipment as investments in their local sourcing of raw materials.\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria invested billions into oil palm, wheat, sugar and cassava, among others. The company said its agro-allied subsidiary had invested up to N15 billion supporting companies in the local value chain, while hoping to save up to $180 million in foreign exchange through its localisation effort.\n\nHans Essaadi, managing director of Nigerian Breweries Plc, said recently that the company had invested about N78 billion in sorghum and cassava cultivation over the last five years. He said in 2021, the company spent a total of N20 billion on the sorghum value chain, appropriated through direct purchase from commercial and smallholder farmers in Nigeria.\n\nMichael Olawale-Cole, president of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said at a recent press briefing that concerns were raised seeing that insecurity had been on the rise and was affecting the business environment, especially in agriculture and supply chain.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry is concerned with the current insecurity crisis because of its impact on businesses and the economy; the agriculture sector showed some evidence of impacts from heightening insecurity and lingering supply chain disruptions and has continually triggered inflation in Nigeria in the past months,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, if the country does not commit to a new order and a more enabled and innovative security architecture, soon, security will suffer a heavier blow once politics takes centre stage in governance.\n\nHe highlighted the need for a surveillance infrastructure that is monitored in real-time to respond to emergencies and foil planned crimes.",

The cash reserve ratio represents a mandatory total Naira deposit which should be held with the Central Bank of Nigeria as a regulatory requirement.\u201d\n\nThe group in its 2021 investors/analysts\u2019 presentation noted that CRR closed at N952 3 billion in 2021 from N1 009 trillion in 2020, resulting in effective CRR ratio of 37 6per cent from 44 33per cent in 2020 (with Special Bills, CRR closed 59 7 per cent).\n\nHowever, UBA\u2019s suffered a debit of N915.15billion in 2021, a decline of 13 per cent from N1.05trillion reported in 2020.\n\nUnion Bank of Nigeria and Stanbic IBTC reported 28per cent and 22 per cent increase in deposits kept with the central bank as CRR in 2021, respectively.\n\nThe effect can be seen in both banks\u2019 profits reported in the year under review.\n\nFrom recording a mandatory deposit of N454.8billion with CBN in 2021 from N356.45billion in 2020, Union Bank of Nigeria reported 20 per cent decline in profit before tax to N20.69 billion in 2021 from N25.97 billion, as Stanbic IBTC reported 30.3per cent drop in profit before tax to N66 billion in 2021 from N94.72 billion when its CRR closed 2021 at N423.18billion in 2021 from N348.17billion reported in 2020.\n\nOther banks are, Fidelity Bank with N686.1billion CRR debit from CBN in 2021 as against N540.13billion in 2021; Wema Bank grew its CRR debit to N313.8billion in 2021 from N246.97billion in 2020; FCMB Group closed 2021 with N309.63billion CRR debit with CBN from N289.14billion in 2020 and Sterling Bank reported N243.87billion mandatory reserve deposits with CBN from N228.79billion in 2020.\n\nAnalysts at GTCO in its report titled, \u201cNigeria Macro-economic outlook for 2022,\u201d explained that the reason for the tight system liquidity is the CBN\u2019s discretionary CRR debits which posed a huge challenge to credit growth for most banks.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cA rough estimate of the industry\u2019s effective CRR position suggests that about 50per cent of total naira deposits are sterilised with the CBN as CRR and Special Bills.\n\n\u201cGoing into 2022, the general build-up to the 2023 Elections will very likely result in a system awash with liquidity. We believe that the apex bank will tighten the system from the second half of the year just as political campaigns start, to mop-up excess liquidity from the system.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is unlikely that the CBN will slow down on its discretional CRR debits, we expect more banks to approach the apex bank for the release of a portion of their \u2018excess\u2019 CRR to assist them in funding their transactions, payment of regulatory levies/fees, etc.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori said the apex bank is using CRR to control inflation, stressing that the introduction of CRR is a drastic monetary policy targeted at controlling money supply in the banking system.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIf CBN fails to maintain its CRR policy, so much money will flow into the market and further deprecates naira. Generally, the policy has not favoured banks because the fund is not yielding any interest and of no benefit to the productive sector.\n\n\u201cThese are funds banks lend to the real sector to drive business activities, finance working capital of productive sector and boost GDP but the CBN is holding it down.\n\n\u201cIt is not a good development for the nation\u2019s economy in general. However, CBN has its reasons and releasing these funds, it might result in hyperinflation, which can damage the nation\u2019s economy. It is like a double edge situation- if you don\u2019t do it, the economy is damaged and if you do it, the economy also struggles.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the only way CBN can cut CRR is when inflation dropped to a single-digit rate.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had at the end of 2020 MPC noted that: \u201cthe committee is confident that increasing the CRR at this time is fortuitous as it will help address monetary-induced inflation whilst retaining the benefits from the Bank\u2019s LDR policy, which has been successful in significantly increasing credit to the private sector as well as pushing market interest rates downwards.\n\n\u201cThe Committee further encouraged the Management of the banks to be more vigorous in its drive to improve access to credit through its pursuit of the Loan-to-deposit ratio policy as doing this would help, not only in creating job opportunities but also help in boosting output growth and in moderating prices.\u201d",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, says the presidential pardon for persons prosecuted on corruption charges by the Federal Government only suggests that there is no need to have anti-corruption agencies in the country.\n\nHe believes the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) have been made to suffer an embarrassment as the pardon has made them irrelevant.\n\nThe governor stated this on Monday while addressing delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State, as part of his ongoing consultation ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nHe was reacting to the pardon granted to former governors Jolly Nyame of Taraba State and Joshua Dariye of Plateau State by the Council of State last week.\n\n\u201cThis is the same government that complained against the judiciary that it is not fighting against corruption,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri. \u201cNow, look at what the judges have passed through; sleepless nights from the FCT High Court to the Court of Appeal to Supreme Court, everything is wasted.\n\n\u201cIf President Muhammadu Buhari knows that he doesn\u2019t want to fight corruption, then, he should disband EFCC and ICPC because he has thoroughly embarrassed them.\n\n\u201cSo, all these things he (Buhari) is doing is because of the election coming soon. They want this person in Plateau State to help them and they want this person in Taraba State to help them, but it will not work because Wike will face them in that election.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Lagos Govt Shuts Chrisland Schools Over Alleged Abuse\n\nGovernor Wike also dismissed the defence put up by the President\u2019s spokesman on why the pardon should not be faulted.\n\nRather, he said it should be a thing to worry about because the same people who said they were fighting corruption were going through the back to release the same people whom they claimed were corrupt.\n\n\u201cSo, when his pressman said I was invited to the Council of State, is it because I\u2019m not there, that is why they did what they did? the governor asked. \u201cIf you wanted me to contribute, you would have sent me the agenda. Then, I would have known what I\u2019m coming to do in the meeting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not when you don\u2019t send me agenda, I come, then you boxed us in, ambushed us, then you said I attended the meeting where they approved it. I will not attend such a meeting. When they said my deputy attended and when they looked back, they could not see my deputy again.\n\n\u201cWhy would you see her? When she had seen what was there, she had to switch off because she knew it was a \u2018wayo\u2019. That is what this APC government is known for.\u201d\n\nThe governor told the delegates that it was time for Nigerians to brace up to correct what he termed the mistake that brought the All Progressives Congress (APC) government to power.\n\nHe said he was offering himself as the most competent aspirant seeking their votes at the presidential primaries to fly the flag of the PDP.\n\nGovernor Wike insisted that it would require a man like him to end the sight of insecurity and poverty bedevilling various parts of the country.",

          "text": "The Biden administration will no longer enforce a US mask mandate on public transportation, after a federal judge in Florida on Monday ruled that the 14-month-old directive was unlawful, overturning a key White House effort to reduce the spread of Covid-19.\n\nSoon after the announcement, all major carriers including American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, as well as national train line Amtrak relaxed the restrictions effective immediately.\n\nLast week, US health officials had extended the mandate to May 3rd requiring travellers to wear masks on airplanes, trains, and in taxis, ride-share vehicles or transit hubs, saying they needed time to assess the impact of a recent rise in Covid-19 cases caused by the airborne coronavirus.\n\nIndustry groups and Republican lawmakers balked and wanted the administration to end the 14-month-old mask mandate permanently.\n\nThe ruling by US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, an appointee of president Donald Trump, came in a lawsuit filed last year in Tampa, Florida, by a group called the Health Freedom Defense Fund.\n\nIt follows a string of rulings against Biden administration directives to fight the infectious disease that has killed nearly one million Americans, including vaccine or test mandates for employers.\n\nJudge Mizelle said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had exceeded its authority with the mandate, had not sought public comment and did not adequately explain its decisions.\n\nEmergency delay\n\nA US administration official said while the agencies were assessing potential next steps, the court\u2019s decision meant CDC\u2019s public transportation masking order was no longer in effect. The administration could still opt to appeal the order or seek an emergency delay in the order\u2019s enforcement.\n\n\u201cTherefore, TSA will not enforce its Security Directives and Emergency Amendment requiring mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs at this time,\u201d the official said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCDC recommends that people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings.\u201d\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration said it will rescind the new Security Directives that were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.\n\nThe ruling comes as Covid-19 infections rise again in the United States, with 36,251 new infections reported on average each day, and 460 daily deaths, based on a seven-day average \u2013 the highest number of reported total Covid-19 deaths in the world.\n\nThe White House called the ruling \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\nThe CDC first issued a public health order requiring masks in interstate transportation in February 2021. The TSA issued a security directive to enforce the CDC order.\n\nThe CDC and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) declined to comment.\n\nUnited Airlines, American, Delta, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and Alaska Airlines said masks are now optional on their planes.\n\n\u201cWe are relieved to see the US mask mandate lift to facilitate global travel as Covid-19 has transitioned to an ordinary seasonal virus,\u201d Delta said. The World Health Organisation warned against comparing the virus to an endemic illness like the flu earlier this year, noting it is evolving too quickly.\n\nThe move could impact travel demand, which has roared back after a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant. US passenger traffic has been averaging about 89 per cent of the pre-pandemic levels since mid-February, according to TSA data.\n\nWith the Covid-19 case count rising again, lifting the mandate could make some passengers wary, while prompting others to fly again.\n\nOnly 36 per cent of Americans think it\u2019s time for people to stop using masks and quarantines so that life can get back to normal after Covid-19, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between January 31st and February 7th. However, while a mere 16 per cent of Democrats hold this view, a whopping 60 per cent of Republicans do, according to the poll.\n\nDelta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian last week acknowledged the risk, but said the airline still expected its flights to be full.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of individual accountability, personal accountability, making your own decisions rather than the government making decisions for people as to how to stay well,\u201d Mr Bastian told Reuters in an interview.\n\nOn Monday, Delta asked its employees to show \u201cunderstanding and patience\u201d as the unexpected nature of the announcement could result in \u201cinconsistent\u201d enforcement.\n\nSince January 2021, there have been a record 7,060 unruly passenger incidents reported, 70 per cent involving masking rules, according to the FAA. Thousands of passengers have been put on \u201cno-fly\u201d lists for refusing to comply with masking requirements.\n\nAlaska said some passengers will remain banned, even after the mask policy is rescinded.",

          "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had begun the \u201cBattle of Donbas\u201d in the east and a \u201cvery large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many Russian troops they send there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves,\u201d he said in a video address on Monday.\n\nZelensky\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, assured Ukrainians their forces could hold off the offensive in \u201cthe second phase of the war\u201d.\n\n\u201cBelieve in our army, it is very strong,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia\u2019s defense ministry on the latest fighting. The governor of the Russian province of Belgorod said Ukrainian forces had struck a border village wounding one resident.\n\nUkrainian media reported a series of explosions, some powerful, along the front line in the Donetsk region, with shelling taking place in Marinka, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nBlasts were also heard in Kharkiv in the northeast, Mykolaiv in the south and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast while air raid sirens were also going off in main centers near the front line, officials and media said.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to verify the reports.\n\nUkraine\u2019s top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defenses \u201calong almost the entire front line of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions\u201d.\n\nDriven back by Ukrainian forces in the north, Russia has refocused its ground offensive in the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas, while launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital, Kyiv.\n\nDonbas has been the focal point of Russia\u2019s campaign to destabilize Ukraine, starting in 2014 when the Kremlin used proxies to set up two separatist \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d in the ex-Soviet state. It is also home to much of Ukraine\u2019s industrial wealth, including coal and steel.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said Russian forces aimed to establish full control over the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions, while intensifying missile strikes in west Ukraine.\n\nBiden to host call with allies\n\nWestern countries and Ukraine accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of unprovoked aggression, and the White House said U.S. President Joe Biden would hold a call with allies on Tuesday to discuss the crisis, including on how to coordinate on holding Russia accountable.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said his dialogue with Putin had stalled after mass killings were discovered in Ukraine.\n\nThe United Nations said on Monday the war\u2019s civilian death toll had surpassed 2,000, reaching 2,072 as of midnight on April 17 from the beginning of the invasion on Feb. 24.\n\nAbout 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians in what it calls a special operation to demilitarise Ukraine and eradicate dangerous nationalists. It rejects what Ukraine says is evidence of atrocities, saying Ukraine has staged them to undermine peace talks.\n\n\u201cHell on earth\u201d\n\nRussia has been trying to take full control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks and which would be a big strategic prize, linking territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014 and freeing up the besieging troops.\n\nVideo footage showed block after residential block in charred ruins. Shell-shocked residents in the Primorskyi district cooked on open fires outside their damaged homes.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are not well,\u201d one resident named Olga told Reuters. \u201cI have mental problems after air strikes, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m really scared. When I hear a plane I just run.\u201d\n\nThe city council said at least 1,000 civilians were still hiding in shelters beneath the vast Azovstal steel plant, which contain myriad buildings, blast furnaces and rail tracks.\n\nMajor Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine\u2019s 36th marine brigade which is still fighting in Mariupol, appealed for help in a letter to Pope Francis.\n\n\u201cThis is what hell looks like on earth \u2026 It\u2019s time (for) help not just by prayers. Save our lives from satanic hands,\u201d he said in the letter, according to excerpts that Ukraine\u2019s Vatican ambassador posted on Twitter.\n\nReuters",
