          "text": "As the choice of the APC running mate continue to generate ripples, a former presidential aspirant and a Chieftain of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has counselled opinion moulders not to allow religion to further divide the already divided country.\n\nIn a statement from his media office in Abuja on Tuesday, Olawepo-Hashim explained that the political aspiration of anybody is not worth the disruption of the unity and peace of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhile we all have the right to express ourselves, we should avoid incendiary comments that can further pose huge challenge to our national integration objectives\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet us quietly make our decisions and express such decisions with our votes\u201d.\n\nThe former Presidential candidate further added that political parties who are insensitive to our national concerns and take some segments of the population for granted must be ready to be punished by the electorates at the polls.\n\n\u201cThat is democracy there is no need for quarrel,\u201d he said.\n\nOlawepo-Hashim maintained that every party must work hard towards the general election to ensure that they are in good reckoning with the electorate at the polls, adding that \u201cthose who have bought delegates must know they will have an uphill task buying estimated 40 million potential voters who may turn out at the next election.\u201d\n\nAccording to INEC, as of 2019, there were 84 million registered voters, but as at Monday 27th June 2022, the ongoing registration figures were as follows: fresh Registrants: 10,487,972; Completed Registration: 8,631,696; Male: 4,292,690; Female: 4,339,006; PWDs: 67,171 and Youths: 6,081,456.\n\nHe added that \u201canyone who loves his or her party, and loves Nigeria must ensure that their parties do the right things.\n\n\u201cBuying up delegates at the party conventions is the cheapest thing to do, the general election is a different ball game. National Security is at stake, not just anything will pass\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called on the President to live up to his promise that the next election will be free and fair, adding that \u201cit is time for our elections to be the true measurement of the will of our people, that is the only way to make democracy deliver result!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us must come to terms with the fact that this is going to be electronic transmission of results from the polling unit and scope for manipulation is limited,\u201d he noted.",

          "text": "Says Vandalisation of National infrastructures and business assets undermining investor confidence\n\nBy Henry Umoru, Abuja\n\nTHE Ashcraft Centre for Science Research yesterday took a swipe at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) that was established to provide basic Infrastructural development for the people of the Niger Delta region, saying that the agency has failed to meet its set objectives.\n\nSpeaking to Journalists yesterday in Abuja on the forthcoming South \u2013 South Zonal Stakeholders Summit with the theme, Domesticating Stakeholders Statutory Responsibilities in Protecting Nigeria\u2019s Critical Infrastructures and other Assets\u201d, Chief of Strategic Planning and Innovations, Ashcraft CSSR, Dr Chiakor Alfred, said that what was required in the country today is to safeguard the nation\u2019s infrastructure for the country\u2019s integrity among other nations of the world.\n\nAlfred who noted that vandalization of the country\u2019s infrastructure runs into hundreds of billions of naira, however lamented that the vandalisation of critical national infrastructures and business assets Nigeria has undermined very greatly investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nAccording to him, this to a very large extent was putting an end to the drive for Foreign Direct Investment, social capital growth, real business development as well as truncating real progress in other sectors of the national economy, adding that the consequences of these criminal activities constitute adverse national security risks of untold proportions and impact our collective destiny gravely adding that hundreds of billions of Naira are lost every year as a result of vandalisation of critical infrastructure.\n\nAlfred who observed that one of the most worrisome challenges to Nigeria\u2019s national economic development is the systematic vandalisation, degradation and destruction of its critical national infrastructures and business assets, said that this is \u201cto give further publicity, through the print, electronic and social media, on the forthcoming South \u2013 South Zonal Stakeholders Summit on: \u201cDOMESTICATING STAKEHOLDERS STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES IN PROTECTING NIGERIA\u2019S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES AND OTHER ASSETS,\u201d The Summit shall hold at the Atlantic Hall, Hotel Presidential, Aba Road \u2013 Port Harcourt, on 25th and 26th July, 2022.\n\n\u201cYou will recall the successful convention of an earlier Summit held at the Congress Hall, Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja on Monday 28 February and Tuesday, 1 March, 2022 on the theme: Protecting the Integrity of Nigeria\u2019s Critical Infrastructures, Monuments and Business Assets. That Summit was convened with the priority objective to infuse a national high \u2013 end architecture for systemized response strategy; explore turnkey solutions for deterrence, threat mitigation and recovery; accelerate strategies for systematic intelligence generation and dissemination and increased security consciousness; establish a network of proactive Stakeholders, Agencies and Policy Making Institutions to initiate, follow up and implement creative strategies; rethink strategies for strengthening the ability of Business Assets to recover and withstand from disruption; galvanize synergy for the prioritization of the multi Agency/ Joint Risk Management efforts to ensure the security and resilience of Nigeria\u2019s critical Infrastructures and Assets in line with identified policy frameworks.\n\n\u201cThe imperative to domesticate the actionable blueprints and Resolutions derived from the Abuja Summit in the Geopolitical Zones and Host Communities form the basis of the convention of the South \u2013 South Regional Summit.\n\n\u201cYou are no doubt aware that Nigeria is at present experiencing an intensity of insecurity, comparable to what obtained in Lebanon in the mid 1980s. The almost daily recurrent cases of terrorism, insurgency, cyber-\u00ad\u2010crimes, banditry, kidnapping, piracy, oil bunkering, drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime, have created an entirely new security environment. Nigeria now faces more security threats that have different characteristics from classic military conflict between states. The gross expansion of the contours that define security boundaries makes it imperative to recognize the eco-\u00ad\u2010systemic dimensions of the threats that stare at us daily and in every form.\n\n\u201cIt is appropriate to regretfully recall the senseless slaughter of over a platoon of Soldiers in Shiroro \u2013 Niger State on Saturday, 2nd July, 2022; the deadly attack and invasion of Kuje Prisons by Terrorist Elements (ISWAP claimed responsibility) on Tuesday, 5th July 2022; the brazen attack on the advance team of the Presidential Convoy in Katsina State on the same Tuesday, 5th July 2022; the Owo Church attack in Ondo State on 5th June, 2022; the ransacking of the Tukur Yusufu Buratai Institute for War and Peace, Biu \u2013 Borno State by ISWAP terrorists on 10th January, 2022; the adduction and killing of priests in Kaduna, Edo and Benue States to name but an atrocious few. The mushrooming of these orgies of killings and destructions are gangrene to our national integrity.\n\n\u201cOne of the most worrisome challenges to Nigeria\u2019s national economic development is the systematic vandalisation, degradation and destruction of its critical national infrastructures and business assets. The consequences of these criminal activities constitute adverse national security risks of untold proportions and impact our collective destiny gravely by undermining investor confidence; inhibiting the drive for Foreign Direct Investment, social capital growth & real business development; and truncating real progress in other sectors of the national economy. You will appreciate the unfortunate fact that the aggregation of uncertainties caused by the hostile operating environment has led to the liquidation and/or relocation to other countries of viable industries and business franchises that provided employment opportunities and other economic value chains to Nigerians. These have depressed the national economy and triggered high rates of unemployment and other attendant problems.\n\n\u201cThe intensity of the diverse and numerous crises of vandalisation and destruction of Nigeria\u2019s infrastructures and assets has prompted, at several instances, the call to arms by His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR \u2013 President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the Armed Forces, Intelligence and Security Establishment and all Nigerians to see it as a patriotic duty to ensure maximum vigilance and shared responsibility in the protection and security of these Assets and platforms at all points in their life-cycle.\n\n\u201cThe South \u2013 South Zonal Stakeholders Summit is therefore a Private/Public Sector Partnership that aims at building synergy, tact and appropriate techniques to enhance knowledge leadership & management in the development of a strategic road map for proactive intervention and response strategy in line with the Risk Management Framework and provisions of the National Protection Policy and Strategy 2022 (CNAINPPS 2022); Petroleum Industry Act, 2021; the National Security Strategy Framework; and the Critical National Infrastructure Bill, 2021 currently under consideration at the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe South \u2013 South Zonal Stakeholders Summit further aims to intensify advocacy for Stakeholders Statutory Responsibilities. It shall also engender the re-engineering of appropriate legislations; and the strategic roadmap for harnessing expert knowledge and country wide technical support for deterrence, codified response strategy and recovery architecture to Nigeria\u2019s critical assets. Equally important is the desire to seek renewed commitment to the challenges impacting the integrity of critical infrastructures and assets in the Region, especially the vandalisation and destruction of its complex ecosystem of separate yet interconnected infrastructures in the Oil and Gas; Telecommunications, Transportation and Power Sectors.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the projected outcome and also sustain confidence building, diverse Stakeholders are mobilized to discuss the challenges impacting the integrity, operations and security of these critical infrastructures and Assets and also seek possible solutions and suggestions. The Stakeholders being mobilized to the Summit include but are not limited to: Nigeria\u2019s National and State Legislatures; the Armed Forces, Security and Intelligence Agencies; Statutory Regulators in the diverse Sectors of Nigeria\u2019s productive economy; Investors/ Business Owners; Operators of the Infrastructures and Assets; Professional and Civil Society Organizations; the Traditional Institution, Socio Cultural and Pressure Groups, etc.\n\n\u201cBy building inter/multi sectoral synergy, the Summit shall engender Stakeholders and citizens with shared responsibilities towards achieving the institutionalization of the road map and priorities of the policy frameworks crafted to provide deterrence, security and resilience of Nigeria\u2019s assets. It is also the expectation of the Conveners that the derivatives from the Summit shall enhance knowledge leadership & management, regenerate confidence in securing Foreign Direct Investment into the country\u2019s productive Sectors; and also boost capital growth and turnkey business startups and development.\n\n\u201cThe security of lives, infrastructures, monuments and assets is the collective responsibility of every citizen, whether private or public. Issues of security, destruction of lives and property know neither religion nor ethnicity. We are calling on the partnership and support of all Stakeholders, both in the Public and Private Sectors, with diverse political, religious and professional orientations to put aside all prejudices to help forge a common front to confront the monster that is threatening the integrity of our corporate existence as a people and as a nation. It is time also to live the slogan that says \u201cif you see something, say something. If you hear something, do something\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent on us all therefore to engage robustly on how to deter and mitigate these challenges in a systematic and coordinated manner. This way, we can be sure of preserving our collective heritage and sanctity of our God endowed resources, both human, technical and material.\u201d",

Little did i know that i was seeing him for the last time few days ago when i went in company of some lawmakers.\n\n\u201cHe was a peace loving and easy-going gentleman who was admired by all. We just lost a bridge builder, a man of peace and a gentleman par-excellent. He will be sorely missed by everyone of us.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker noted the dedicated and selfless nature of Hon Popoola as well as his quality representation in the House as a member of the 9th Oyo State House of Assembly earned him the return ticket of the PDP in Ibadan SouthEast 2 State Constituency.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Hon Popoola has bid the world goodbye at such a very tender age. He has written his name in gold in the Oyo State House of Assembly as a one who contributed immensely to lawmaking and legislative activities. We started the 9th Assembly together but alas he ended the race less than a year to the finish line.\n\n\u201cMy condolences to his entire family, his wife and children and to the good people of Ibadan SouthEast State Constituency.

          "text": "Ex-militant leader Reuben Wilson on Tuesday berated the Senate Committee on Public Accounts over its threat to issue a warrant of arrest against the Interim Administrator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP), Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (Rtd).\n\nThe senate committee was irked by Dikio\u2019s failure to honour its invitation over the N10 billion which was allegedly unaccounted for in an auditor\u2019s report.\n\nThe Chairman of the committee, Sen. Matthew Urhogbide, was quoted to have issued the threat due to the alleged failure of Dikio to honour several invitations extended to him.\n\nIn his reaction, Wilson said that the audit report in question traced the unaccounted funds to 2015-2016 fiscal year, long before Dikio was appointed.\n\nHe wondered why anyone who has the interest of the Niger Delta at heart would try to pick up a fight with Dikio who had utilised the amnesty office well beyond the imagination of ex-agitators.\n\nWilson, who is also the Founder of the Pastor Reuben Initiative for Good Leadership and Accountability, an APC support group, recalled how ex-militants frequently blocked the East-West Road due to one form of agitation or the other.\n\nHe noted that the protests were due to the mismanagement of the Amnesty Office by past administrators.\n\nWilson pointed out that since Dikio came onboard, none of those needless protests has been heard of.\n\nHe said that it would be a great disservice if he (Wilson) did not put the records straight.\n\nThe ex-militant leader warned against moves by anyone to drag the name of Dikio to the mud over baseless issues.\n\n\u201cThe amnesty programme is a very sensitive programme, a security programme meant to maintain peace and stability in the Niger Delta through meaningful engagement of the ex-militants which Dikio has done,\u201d the ex-agitator said.\n\n\u201cTraining is currently ongoing for over 100 ex-militants in Akwa-Ibom. I just visited the place. They are being trained on fishery, piggery and cocoa farming, feed production and more.\n\n(NAN)",

If Nigerians elect him based on his competency and pedigree as their new president, does it concern MASSOB? It\u2019s not our business.\n\n\u201cMr Peter Obi is not the first person to contest presidential election since September 1999 we started the MASSOB non-violence self- determination struggle. Why attaching him to us now?\n\nMASSOB, therefore, advised Shiekh Gumi to explain his role and other Fulani cabals in the terrorist attack and breaking of Kuje prisons in Abuja.\n\nThe group told the Islamic cleric not to use Obi and pro-Biafra agitation to divert attentions.",

The yearning of the people of the Niger Delta region is for the Federal Government to constitute a substantive board. Any other agitation, especially from some greedy and self-centred persons, for Mr. President to appoint another interim administrator will be resisted. Because there are rumours of some persons making moves for the appointment of another interim administrator for the NDDC. If this is true, it will mean that it will be the fourth time an interim administrator will be appointed, in total neglect of the Act setting up the commission. This is an aberration. The people of the Niger Delta have been patient and understanding enough. My simple message to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, is for him to constitute, without delay, a substantive Board for the NDDC, in line with the Act setting up the Commission. I also wish to add here that, now that the Forensic Audit is completed, and the White Paper out, the Report should be made public to enable Nigerians know those who are culpable.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s foremost public accountability non-profit organization, Akin Fadeyi Foundation (AFF), is set to launch \u2018What Women Can Do\u2019 competition, which would prise open the vast untapped potentials of women as very significant social actors in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement by the organisation\u2019s Executive Director, Akin Fadeyi, the competition is aimed at stimulating a gender-inclusive leadership conversation across the cyberspace.\n\nIt said the event, which will kick off with a pre-event media conversation and convergence on July 19, 2022, would start at 11am, and feature media and public policy actors and practitioners, including feature editors of newspapers and online news platforms, alongside women leaders and other distinguished participants.\n\nThe statement quoted Fadeyi as saying: \u201cThis gathering will speak to and unearth the huge possibilities that remain unleashed in the country with the loud absence of the participation of women in the public space especially after the just concluded party primaries. It is also an affirmation of the gender equality and social Inclusion programme thrust of our funders, the MacAuthur Foundation.\n\n\u201cWhat women can do will speak to how leadership would be a lot more impactful when women are empowered to act as equal stakeholders in national development. The ultimate objective of this programme will be to encourage women to endure in their leadership ambitions despite the present turns in Nigerian politics, to re-affirm their capabilities as equally endowed social actors who are not intellectually subordinate in any way, and to stimulate public conversation on the need for gender parity in the access to power.\u201d\n\nIt said the Foundation is motivated by the understanding that while Nigeria has never been in lack of high quality women who can play major progressive roles in politics, a number of the factors have skewed the system against women from earlier times, adding that these not only include the pervasive norms and cultural beliefs that emphasise the subordinate position and roles of women in society.\n\nFadeyi, in the statement said the Foundation is therefore poised to sponsor a competition amongst Nigeria\u2019s female folk, where they would speak to their competences and what they are capable of doing, and will do different when they take on the reins of leadership and occupy impactful positions of public decision-making.\n\nHe said of the competitors who will make leadership pitches and speak to any topic of interest from agriculture to education, healthcare, power generation, science and innovation, 10 finalists will be selected, adding that the top five finalists will be rewarded with different gifts on the basis of the strength, innovativeness, uniqueness and acceptability of their pitches, as another set of five finalists will go away with consolation prizes.\n\n\u201cMore recently, this has been buttressed by the patriarchal configuration of institutions and systems that have set up unreasonable standards that delimit the access and participation of women in the consequential public space. This was more recently evident in the influence of money on our political process, making it difficult for women to get involved without serious sponsors, which is certainly hard to come by as an altruistic proposition.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the Akin Fadeyi Foundation (AFF) is prepared to deepen its work on political and social accountability, as it gets ready to deploy its FlagIt app for election observation, monitoring and reporting.\n\n\u201cAs the Nigerian general election is just around the corner and some of the persistent concerns of citizens remain issues pertaining to the free and fairness of the polls, particularly with the potential participation of a huge youth and digitally savvy demographic, the app is set to offer a very critical tool for evidence gathering, while monitoring and observing, and for documentation to assist in election and post-election accountability,\u201d Fadeyi said.",

          "text": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nThe development comes as the sportswear manufacturer terminated a four-year contract it had with Nigeria in a letter dated Wednesday, August 4, 2021, and signed by the company\u2019s director, Manuel Edlheimb.\n\nAccording to reports, the AFN under the leadership of Ibrahim Gusau had entered into a controversial $2.76 million deal with PUMA on July 24, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe deal reportedly led to a major crisis that split the athletics body into two factions, with Gusau and AFN First Vice President, Sunday Adeleye accused of sidelining other members of the board during the signing of the deal.\n\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\n\nPart of the contract is that PUMA will supply apparel to all age categories to Nigeria\u2019s Athletics team for four years at no cost.\n\nIn addition, gold medalists at the Olympic Games will earn $15,000 (N6 million), silver medalists will get $5,000 (N2 million) while a bronze medal will fetch athletes wearing the PUMA apparel at the games $3,000 (N1.2 million).\n\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\n\nAccording to a source quoted by Punch, the sports ministry would be made a party to the suit \u201cbecause they issued a memo granting AFN permission to seek sponsorship. PUMA sees AFN as a representative of Nigeria with that memo. It gave them confidence that AFN had approval. They also claimed that as of the time of signing the contract, the parties involved are recognised by law and FG, and there was no faction to warrant suspicion. They believe an administration is a continuum and the agreement has government backing..\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by the AFN First Vice President, Adeleye while appearing on Arise TV as a guest on Thursday.\n\nWhile displaying evidence and documents showing the FG\u2019s approval for the federation to seek a sponsor, Adeleye said, \u201cThe contract is a non-disclosure one. It is between PUMA and AFN with FMYSD\u2019s permission. We warned that this may lead to litigation and wrote to all parties involved, including finance and justice ministries.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that PUMA will go to court on this matter. Their officials have called that they are sending documents from their legal department. We wrote the minister on the implications for Nigeria. This won\u2019t make other companies deal with Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Gusau-led AFN did everything possible to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\nOn why the kits were kept in a store, he said, \u201cOur AFN has been barred from using the facility in the stadium and we needed to run the activities of the association. We have a store and office that we run. The constitution didn\u2019t say our office should be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would take responsibility for the termination of the contract, Adeleye said, \u201cWe should be awarded because we are patriotic. The Federal Government asked federations to look for sponsors (before Sunday Dare). This contract precedes him. They are aware of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe worked with instruction. We looked for a sponsor so that the burden can be taken off the Federal Government. The sports ministry should be sanctioned. We need a shake-up in the sports ministry.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the minister and sports ministry under his administration. Our problems have never been this worse. Federations have issues but not to this extend. Despite a court order, the minister is resolute in destroying some people. We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A. Elijah, Secretary-General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view, therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ an internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nThe contract termination comes a few hours after a trending video showed Nigeria\u2019s shot put medal hopeful, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washing his jersey ahead of his final game at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe caption in the video indicated that the athlete was given one jersey for the competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey,\u201d he wrote.",

I have already passed 2/3 drug tests, but for some reason, i am not allowed to do my third test because of \u201cfear of failure\u201d. they speak repeatedly about trying to fix the broken system that is nigerian athletics by firing and hiring all new staff, but the corruption still lives.\n\n\u201cI, unfortunately, will not be competing at worlds or the commonwealth games.\u201d\n\nBorn on March 3, 1988, she was Scandinavia's fastest woman ever over 60m and 100m. Okparaebo has won the 100m national title 13 times. She moved to Norway as a nine-year old and grew up in Ammerud.\n\nShe won the silver medal at 60 metres for women in the 2009 European Athletics Indoor Championships and the bronze medal in the same discipline in 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships.\n\nAnother aggrieved athlete, Akintola Alaba said his dreams has been shattered.\n\nAlaba said, \u201cSadly, I\u2019m going to be out of world championship after I qualified for 3 events(100M,200M & 4*100M) not because I failed dope but because of politics because that\u2019s what it looks like rn; they hid under the umbrella of OCT(out of competition test) meaning I didn\u2019t submit my whereabouts or whatever(been on this shii since march ).\n\n\u201cThey already cost me a major championship(that\u2019s they plan ikr)and I knew they know what they doing/did . Thanks to everyone that cared and showed love, really appreciate it Stepping stone to greater things MT on me .\u201d\n\nAlaba broke a 17-year-old indoor record and set a career-best in the 200-metre dash with a time of 20.72 seconds at the C-USA Championship, landing him in first place in the finals in February 2022.\n\nHe was placed 14th at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships for a time of 21.49 second in the 200-meter dash on March 11, 2022. He took first place in the 60-metre dash at the C-USA Championship with a time of 6.72 seconds.",

          "text": "Williams Uchemba, the Nigerian actor and comedian, has solicited funds and food items for some university lecturers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent video, the movie star said he received a distress call from the lecturers from the University of Nigeria, Nsuka (UNN), seeking for assistance.\n\nAccording to him, the lecturers said they couldn\u2019t feed their families because they have not been paid salaries for the past few months.\n\nHe also quoted them as saying that their withheld salaries were due to the ongoing ASUU strike in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUchemba said he will be supporting them with \u201ca truckload of food items and the sum of N500,000\u201d.\n\nHe also pleaded with the public to support the lecturers with their donations.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, I received what I would call a distress call from my alma matter, University of Nigeria, Nsuka (UNN). Some lecturers came together and made a video for me, asking for assistance,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt broke my heart to realise that the help they are asking for is food, what they\u2019ll eat. For the past few months, they haven\u2019t received salary and they said all their savings have been exhausted.\n\n\u201cI saw a video of some of them explaining how they can\u2019t feed their kids anymore. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t post these videos because of their reputation. I just can\u2019t post these videos, my conscience doesn\u2019t want me to.\n\n\u201cBut it shows me how desperate they are for lecturers to make a video to ask for such things. So what I want to do is that I want to take a truckload of rice down to them and other basic things like oil and condiments that go along with it.\n\n\u201cIt is very heartbreaking that we\u2019ve gotten to this point in this country where lecturers cannot feed anymore and it breaks my heart, even more, to see some of them that I know in that situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI on my own will be donating N500,000 for them and whatever it is you can give N1000, N2000, bags of rice, oil, whatever you can give us because we want to go down there and see how many of them we can give these relief materials.\n\n\u201cFor their reputation sake I might not be posting the outcome because I usually do that for transparency and integrity but because of the people involved, I wouldn\u2019t want to post it.\n\n\u201cBut what I would sure do is post what we bought for them. I might not post their faces but I\u2019ll show what we got for them. I would really appreciate if you come in and assist us in making this happen.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by TheCable (@thecableng)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

AI models require lots and lots of data to help them learn, and there\u2019s not a lot of human-translated training data for these languages,\u201d the company added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe worked with professional translators for each of these languages to develop a reliable benchmark that can automatically assess translation quality for many low-resource languages.\n\n\u201cWe also work with professional translators to do human evaluation too, meaning people who speak the languages natively evaluate what the AI produced.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nBalkissa Ide Siddo, Meta\u2019s public policy director for Africa, listed Igbo among the languages in the project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfrica is a continent with very high linguistic diversity, and language barriers exist day to day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce that 55 African languages will be included in this machine translation research, making it a major breakthrough for our continent.\n\n\u201cImagine visiting your favourite Facebook group, coming across a post in Igbo or Luganda, and being able to understand it in your own language with just a click of a button.

Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "A few weeks ago, I sat down for a chat with Gideon Dada. A few minutes before the call, he had just returned from the gym, a daily ritual he adopted to stay fit while working remotely.\n\nDada is an Investment Associate at Metis Capital Partners, Nigerian businessman Hakeem Belo-Osagie\u2019s family office. He joined the firm in December 2021 after leaving Sankore Investments, where he was part of the wealth management team optimising the wealth management process.\n\nFamily offices help high-net-worth families to manage their wealth. Historically, family offices managed the wealth of one family; today, some family offices cater to more than one family.\n\nIn 2021, he got a LinkedIn message from someone at Metis Capital who was recruiting and wanted to know if he was interested in the role. After looking through the job description, he put in an application and took some assessments before landing the job.\n\nBut why would he leave a job in a structured environment for the murky waters of venture capital? For Dada, it was primarily the opportunity to work with his current bosses at Metis Capital.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was the opportunity to work with these guys and learn from them. No doubt, I had a good job in asset management, but when the opportunity came to learn from these guys with this consulting background, I just felt like it was the perfect opportunity for me. Honestly, I haven\u2019t been disappointed between when I started in December and now.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the unpredictability of venture capital was also a huge draw.\n\n\u201cComing to VC, it\u2019s much more flexible; you don\u2019t look through the same deck twice. So today, I\u2019m looking at something in Bitcoin wallet infrastructure. The next day I\u2019m looking at data infrastructure and fintech the next. You have to go out to get the knowledge for all of these opportunities you come across.\u201d\n\nLanding a role in VC\n\nHaving been headhunted for the role, Dada believes a few qualities helped him stand out.\n\n\u201cFirst, I think responsibility. It\u2019s a family office, so I pretty much lead conversations on the VC aspects. So you want someone you are not running after on Monday morning, midnight, or Friday. If you need something, you want to know that this person is available and taking responsibility for your task. [You want] someone you can rest assured would perform on your tasks.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks his LinkedIn profile helped show his experience and ability to manage expectations.\n\n\u201cI think my profile on LinkedIn just shows my track record of experience. So right from 200 Level, I\u2019ve always had a job on the side. And so that just shows the ability to manage your time.\u201d\n\nGideon Dada, Investment Associate at Metis Capital Partners\n\nFor students and recent graduates looking to get into the space, he disclosed that it is crucial to prove their value to potential employees and build their networks.\n\nLike many investors in Africa, Dada disclosed that Metis Capital could only invest in a handful of startups that they come across. However, they also pass on deals to other investors in their network.\n\n\u201cOne out of every four would be really interesting for us, but because of budgetary restrictions and the fact that it\u2019s still a new space, we\u2019re still taking it easy. We give small tickets between $10,000 to $25,000 and then bring in our value. We\u2019ve invested in about 10% of startups that we\u2019ve received.\u201d\n\nAs a sector-agnostic investor, Dada disclosed that Metis Capital invests in startups where they can add significant value, with regulatory guidance and market entry strategies two of their strengths.\n\n\u201cWe like to invest in companies where we think we can add substantial value. We\u2019ve done a couple of fintech deals because our chairman has a lot of experience in that space. We also look to help guys that are establishing outside Nigeria but also looking to penetrate the Nigerian markets. You find that when companies do their due diligence, they come back to us and are saying, \u2018Oh, whatever ticket size you\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re happy to have you on our cap table, even if it\u2019s less than the minimum ticket.\u2019\u201d\n\nGideon Dada\u2019s most exciting sectors\n\nWith technology upending several sectors on the content, three sectors stand out for Dada \u2013 fintech, healthtech, and eCommerce.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot of buzz around fintech, and it\u2019s still the most exciting sector on the continent; there\u2019s still a lot of space for growth. And I say that because we\u2019re only scratching the surface office right now; 95% of transactions are in cash, so only 5% of transactions happening on the continent have been digitised.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of innovation around healthcare as well, especially after COVID happened. So I like innovations that are coming up there as well. The last would be eCommerce, and I see a future where most of our basic necessities \u2014 groceries and all of that \u2014 would be delivered to our doorstep.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of entrepreneur should avoid VC money?\n\nAlthough VCs typically invest in tech startups, not all founders will be a good fit for investors. One reason for this, according to Dada, is a reluctance to communicate the state of the business to VCs.\n\n\u201cOff the top of my head, I\u2019m thinking, if you\u2019re a bad communicator or you don\u2019t do well with feedback and just keeping people posted, you should stay away from accepting investors\u2019 money because whoever is investing wants to know how their funds are faring, as often as possible, or at least have an idea of when to expect an update.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks part-time entrepreneurs should not look for VC investment.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not your full-time job, if you\u2019re not committing a hundred per cent to the product that you\u2019re building, stay away from collecting VC money. I mean, during due diligence, it would come up. I won\u2019t invest in you if you\u2019re not committing a hundred per cent to this.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he explains that founders looking to raise from VCs need to be clear on what they want from these investors. For example, founders can have a mix of foreign and local investors to enable them to access capital and expertise.\n\nThe role of investors in building strong cultures\n\nStartups have been lauded for espousing what many consider to be a better workplace culture. However, culture goes beyond new MacBooks, gym memberships, and remote work options. But investors can help where many startups lack experience or examples of healthy work cultures.\n\nDada suggests that many questions about work cultures can be solved with repeated education.\n\n\u201cProper sensitisation of even experienced folks is very important, and continuously hammering on these things helps with that. For founders, it should be more around regular follow-up and checkup calls.\u201d\n\nWith venture capital relatively unknown to many Africans, Dada says the biggest misconception is that one needs to have it all figured out before getting into the field; he also shared that VCs are constantly learning.",

          "text": "Catholic priest to Christians: Stop moaning over Muslim-Muslim ticket, there\u2019re other options\n\nA priest of the Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja, Rev. John Oluoma, has said that Nigerians who are worried about the Muslim-Muslim ticket fielded by the All Progressives Congress (APC) are not ready to make an informed choice in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, had on Sunday, announced Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, as his running mate.\n\nThe unveiling of Shettima who is a Muslim like Tinubu elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians, with Christian groups kicking against the decision.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the North had issued a statement criticising Tinubu\u2019s decision, saying the ruling party \u201chas no regard for our diversity\u201d as a country.\n\nAlso, some members of the APC have resigned from the party over the development.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Oluoma said Nigerians should not be agitating over APC\u2019s decision to field two Muslims for the 2023 presidential election because there are other candidates.\n\n\u201cI honestly do understand why some persons feel scared about it, however, I refuse to validate or consolidate that fear for some reasons. APC is just one party, we have other parties in Nigeria. One of the beauties of democracy is the availability of options,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cCrying over APC\u2019s candidates in the midst of other candidates questions our readiness to change the status quo or our capacity to make and accept informed decisions.\u201d\n\nThe clergyman said the ruling party fielded two Muslims for the top offices in the country for the sake of electoral victory.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one major reason behind the Muslim-Muslim ticket by APC \u2014 electoral victory. Without a Muslim VP, the APC will lose significant votes from the North and probably lose the entire presidency. This is the fear and the reason for a Muslim VP,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone beguile you to make it a religious problem, if you do, you will keep losing the big picture. I\u2019ll never reduce this issue to a religious problem, it\u2019s more of political dexterity. APC chose electoral votes over religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cOf course, APC knows a number of Christians will be offended, but they still went ahead probably knowing that the mathematics of more votes favour them in this issue more than feelings. If you don\u2019t like it, you are right.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you are right crying and bemoaning it? That\u2019s where you and I separate. There\u2019s Labour Party driving a political revolution with Peter Obi, invest in it, be part of it, preach it and convert others if Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar and All progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu don\u2019t appeal to you.\n\n\u201cWhether this is a smart move by APC or not depends on voters. If it\u2019s a bad strategy, it\u2019s the APC that should bemoan it, not you an independent voter. Even card-carrying members of a party are not forced to vote for the candidates of their party.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of these, I wish to state the following implications: If Tinubu, a Muslim from the south cannot win an election with a Christian VP from the North, northern Muslims, southern Muslims and northern Christians don\u2019t need me to spell it out for them\u201d.\n\nThe clergyman said Nigerians should not \u201crelegate religious sentiments only when it\u2019s convenient for your particular goal, let\u2019s get thorough and rigorous about it for the good of our country. Actually, Nigeria and Nigerians stand to gain better when we throw away all these sentiments\u201d.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and ex-Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, were noticeably absent at the All Progressives Congress mega rally for the re-election of Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, held in Osogbo on Tuesday.\n\nThe mega rally committee in a statement on Monday, signed by its spokesperson, Funke Egbemode, had listed Osinbajo as one of the guests expected at the rally. But the Interior Minister was not listed.\n\nSome of the governors in attendance included: Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna, Abdulrahaman Abudulrasak of Kwara, Hope Uzodinma of Imo, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, and Prof. Babagana Zullum of Borno States.\n\nAlso in attendance were; a former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; the 2023 APC presidential flagbearer and his running mate, Senator Bola Tinubu, Kashim Shettima respectively.\n\nWhen asked why his principal did not attend the rally, the media adviser to the Interior Minister, Mr Sola Fasure, said Aregbesola was not invited for the event.\n\nFasure, who also said Aregbesola was not a member of the APC campaign council for Osun poll, further noted that the Minister was attending an official event in Lagos on Tuesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cHe is not a member of the campaign committee, but officially he went to the Kirikiri Correctional Centre in Lagos. It was an official visit. He was not invited (for Osun rally). He is not in the campaign council. He was not invited by either the candidate or the party. There is also a case in court because he supported a candidate, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, and the case will come up on Thursday.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the rally, the APC National Chairman, Adamu declared that the party was not leaving anything to chance with Osun election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a mega rally to promote our candidate. We are taking no chances with the affairs of Osun because the state deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development. This is why we have come in full strength to support him in a bid to ensure his re-election. Those who have a fair mind will testify that he has done so much since he became governor in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are here not only to testify to what he has done but to appeal to you to turn out in large numbers to vote massively for him. We are anticipating a better outcome than what we had in Ekiti and by the grace of God, we are sure of victory. I want you to be the APC ambassadors, telling those who are not here what you have seen. Continue to spread the good works of this government in the nooks and crannies of the state. We are not leaving any chances with the affairs of Osun.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, lauded Oyetola\u2019s efficiency in managing the state\u2019s meagre resources, calling on citizens to look beyond political sentiments in their choice of who to elect, and to vote massively for Oyetola.\n\nIn his remarks, the APC presidential flagbearer, Senator Bola Tinubu, urged the people of Osun State to replicate the victory recorded last month in Ekiti.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have come to ask that you vote massively on Saturday for the APC, not as a mark of entitlement, but because of the future of your children.\n\n\u201cBefore you make your decision, think of the future. We are a party that guarantees your future because we are known for fulfilling our promises. Let us entrust the affairs of our state into the hands of those who mean business, not mushroom parties.\u201d\n\nOsun State Governor, Oyetola, urged the people, especially workers, to shun political traducers who are peddling falsehood that his administration would renege in its commitment to their welfare if re-elected, saying he remained strongly committed to their welfare.\n\nHe also declared readiness to do beyond what he had done in his first term, saying the welfare of workers and citizens and the overall development of Osun remained his priority.",

B. Durotoye, adding that women continued to serve on the COMEG Council till date.\n\nHe went further to explain that three women served in recent Councils of COMEG namely, Dr. Mrs Stella-Marie Sonuga, Madam Rose Ndong and Mrs Rosemary Adedoja, stating that COMEG will continue to play its regulatory role in the development of the mining sector with regard for gender balance.\n\n\u201cCOMEG will continue to promote gender equality in line with the National Gender Policy of Nigeria, and we want more women to understand that they stand a great chance to develop themselves by taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by COMEG in line with the National Gender Policy of Nigeria,\u201d he added.",

Prof. Linus Asuquo has said that research and development should be given priority if the nation was bent on achieving its goals on economic diversification.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in an interview granted in Abuja, Asuquo noted that capacity building interms of training and retraining of human capacity was important for the growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe said that at the NMDC, there was need to renovate some of the structures to give it a conducive emblem for research and development and such efforts been put in place has ensured its effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nHe explained \u201cOn capacity building in terms of human capacity building, we have done enough to train our people for research and development, we need to train and retrain, we have done that locally and internationally, we have sent some of our staff to Australia, Japan and to South Africa for training, the essence of that is that our research and development must be productive. If you lack in training you can not go forward, and the people have stayed there for many years without adequate training, so they have now been trained.\n\n\u201cIf we are to go forward in this country for research and development, that is where our priority should be, if we really want to develop in this country. If we want to diversify our economy, we can not diversify without meaningful research and Development as a lot of research has to be done for us to go forward.\u201d\n\nThe NMDC boss who was appointed in July 2018 disclosed that the inability to analyze the materials used for building projects was one of the factors contributing to building collapse in the country.\n\nHe said that individuals and construction companies used scrap metal to produce metals without allowing NMDC to effectively carry out their job.\n\nIn his words:\u201dWe have to analyze even though we have SON, but we are the ones to analyze the type of materials , whether they are fit for building or not. So that has also been a challenge for NMDC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development of the Centre, he continued \u201cbecause I found out that the security of that place was very poor and incident of thefts was almost on a weekly basis; so I had to beef up security of the place by contacting security personnel, the Police, the SSS, and the Civil Defence and they were ready to cooperate and since then, the theft incident reduced to the nearest minimum.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there was need to restructure the management for effective and efficient running of the Centre, hence the restructuring of departments from nine to seven and placing the right people in the right places and this he confirmed has yielded dividends.\n\nAsuquo also said \u201cwith the very poor power supply in the country and for any meaningful research, power was necessary and there was no power. We were going with a small generator and we could not do any effective research, so I had to find an alternative power source by solar system so we had to install the solar system in all the laboratories for effective analysis and now people can analyse using our equipment.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the core mandate of the Metallurgical Center, the Director General, further explained \u201cstarting with exploration, let me say that in this country we have identified 44 strategic minerals in the country, in 500 locations and therefore, for us to be effective we have to analyze, NMDC has to work on mineral processing and then in the metal sector, we have to know the type of minerals we have in the country, the compositions, and so forth. So that was a challenge for us to have a laboratory ready.\n\n\u201cBut this place was established as far back as 1973, as a research laboratory for the then steel plant , so you believe that from 1973 till the time I came, the equipment were very obsolete, some of them were not useful again, therefore there was need to find the state of the art equipment to do meaningful research and we were able to procure state of the art equipment for research and Development.\n\n\u201cAnd am pleased to inform you that right now, NMDC, even though not sufficient because the recent development is capital intensive, we now have the state of the art equipment to analyze these minerals that we have: apart from that, we also have the methodology department for some analysis.\n\n\u201cNigeria has iron ore in Itakpe, which is of very high iron concentration but this was meant for Delta State Company because it has about 250 millions turns of iron but we have another iron ore in Akpaja about three billion turns that will take so many years, no research has been done on it to find whether is suitable or not , that is our own work in NMDC, to find out whether the Akpaja iron ore will be suitable, of course is suitable, I worked on that in 1990/ 1991, to find out ways that Akpaja iron ore could be used for our Steel plant by selective calculation which we have to use cassava starch to make flux sarage, even though it has some phosphorus, it\u2019s not a problem because that can be dephosphorised during the processing.\u201d\n\nOn coal, Asuquo revealed that, \u201cone of the materials that we use for iron making is Coal and a lot of work has been done in NMDC about coal and unfortunately most of our coal, even though we have in abundance like Enugu coal, they are not prime coating coal, that is you cannot have real coal, hundred percent coke from that coal, so what we have done in our research is to use the lavia Obi coal and blend with the imported coal to form our coke, that will reduce the cost of production, importation and thus, foreign exchange will be reserved. We have also worked sufficiently on our coal.\n\n\u201cJust last week, we have acquired scanning electron microscope which is the state of the art equipment for metal and mineral processing and two people had to come from UK to train our staff, which was a human capacity training. We trained about ten people which will be enough to train others in the place on how to use this.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development for its intervention in the development of the Centre which includes renovation of seven of its buildings, procurement of equipment such as the scanning electron microscope and a lapping polishing machine adding that \u201csome teams are coming from South Africa to train our staff on this lapping polishing machine. With such capacity building, we are set to do meaningful research and Development compared to what we saw before.\u201d\n\nOn the challenges confronted so far, the DG said \u201cthere are lots of changes, research and Development is capital intensive in any country, by the grace of God I have been able to in my span of sixty eight years to travel to more than fifty six countries of the world and I have seen that research and Development is capital intensive, the whole world is putting attention in research and Development, people are budgeting between three to four percent GDP for research and Development and I want to thank Mr. President because recently, he increase form zero point one to zero point five but that is still very inadequate.\u201d\n\nProjecting into the coming years, in the steel sector, Engr. Asuquo said: \u201cLike I said, if we have adequate funding and we pay attention to what we are doing, given priority we should be expecting development in the country. Let me say this, as I have repeated many times, we should not play with the Ajaokuta Steel company. A lot of politics has been toiling with it over the years, if you know the quntoms of metals imported into this country, then you know where we are. We are spending some billions of naira to important metals, now considering the railways we are constructing, if we have Ajaokuta Steel company working, I don\u2019t think we should have been importing these metals , we would have reserved our economy, we would have created more employment for our youths, there would be skill acquisition and so on, the benefits are numerous.\n\n\u201cSo, if we start doing research and development and the Ajaokuta Steel Company is working, there will be development, without Ajaokuta working, then we are just playing lip service. Also there must be a political will in this country for us to say this is our priority.\u201d\n\nReacting to the claim that the Ajaokuta Steel Company was outdated, he said, \u201cpeople who say that are not informed, if you do a lot of research, you will know that Russia cannot do without blast furnace, even Indian cannot do without blast furnace. I was in India in the year 2000 and they were producing hundred million tonnes of steel in that year and that was the method were they using there. We just seat down at home here and criticize that our Ajaokuta Steel Company is outdated.\n\n\u201cWhat are the new methods that can be used in the production of Iron and Steel except the blast furnace, a lot of people are saying nobody is using coal, Russia is using coal, China is using coal, so what are we talking about? Everyone wants to be an engineer now, Nigerians like to talk but when it comes to practical terms to proffer solutions they go silent.\n\n\u201cAny person that have seen the amount of money spent in Ajaokuta, to scrap that place will be a colossal waste, and suicidal. Even if it\u2019s outdated, we can modernize it into sections; that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Ajaokuta Steel Company. Starting from the blast furnace, where they will produce iron , after that you produce steel, from Steel, you have a continuous casting, where you produce rods.\u201d\n\nHe further added \u201cDid you know you can generate power from the Ajaokuta Steel Company to so many States , we should not just start at once, we can think big and start small.\u201d\n\nOn NMDC\u2019s collaboration with other MDA\u2019s for wealth creation, Asuquo further stated that in December 2020, it had collaborated with Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria, DICON and has also signed an MOU with NASENI.\n\n\u201cDICON was importing armaments from China and I wrote to them that we have that capacity to produce their raw materials, instead of importing brass from China, we could produce for them, the DG visited us twice with his team and was excited with what he saw and what we were doing, and then sent a technician team to us to evaluate and the MOU was signed on December 3rd, 2020, to produce the raw materials for them, if such a thing is implemented, I can tell you that I may not need money from government because the billions they were using in importing, if they give that to us it will be sufficient for our research and development. We can generate enough revenue when we collaborate with these organisations, recently, we have signed an MOU with NASENI to collaborate to generate revenue, the Executive Vice Chairman came with his team and we are working with them on some meaningful research. Before you talk about generating revenue, something has to be done before generating revenue which is to equip the place.\u201d",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

This was made known in a statement made available to the media yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, REA Mr. Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad explained that the framework underpinned by the MoU between both parties, is expected to be implemented in a sustainable and impactful manner, while also addressing one of the Agency\u2019s strategic objectives \u2013 to promote electricity consumption for \u201cproductive use\u201d in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe MoU will mutually benefit both the REA and FADAMA. Both parties are keen to unlock the economic potential in agrarian communities, through the provision of electricity solutions for agro-processing and irrigation schemes\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe MoU will ensure timely communication and cooperation during the implementation stage of the programme, including support (where applicable) in conducting field surveys, monitoring/supervision and impact assessments.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Technical Services, REA Barka Sajou said that subsequently the agro-energy programme, as well as other proposed programmes under the framework, will be implemented to demonstrate opportunities for the private sector.\n\nAnd based on the lessons learned, viable agriculture-energy solutions and business models can be adopted and scaled commercially.\n\nThe MoU is also expected to consider the Agency\u2019s recently-launched Energizing Agricultural Programme EAP.\n\nThe EAP is a three-year initiative with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet GEAPP, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation that aims to stimulate the use of mini-grid electricity in agricultural productive uses.\n\nThese \u201cAgro-Energy\u201d programmes are intended to provide electricity for productive use and unlock the economic potential/activities in rural and agrarian communities alike.\n\nSo far, the Agency has communicated and cooperated with stakeholders during the pre-implementation stage, including support in conducting desktop and field surveys to identify viable sites.\n\nMore specifically, and in line with REA\u2019s proposed agro-energy programmes, the NFDP\u2019s component 2 (Small Scale Community Owned Infrastructure) aims to rehabilitate surface water and construct new small-scale irrigation schemes and borehole schemes, as well as other groundwater irrigation schemes and infrastructure support. REA intends to provide decentralised solar pumps and/or centralised solar mini-grids to viable FADAMA irrigation schemes.\n\nThe National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) are a Federal Government Agency mandated to provide assistance, durable solutions and support to persons of concern, including Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), Refugees, Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Stateless Persons, as well as Returnees.

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "title": "2023: Tinubu\u2019s Muslim-Muslim Ticket Is \u2018A Disastrous Error, Dead On Arrival\u2019 \u2013 Babachir Lawal",
          "text": "Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has faulted the announcement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket by the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nLawal, in a note he personally signed on Tuesday, described the decision as a \u201cdisastrous error.\u201d\n\nMr Tinubu on Sunday had announced former Borno State Governor, Kassim Shettima, as his running mate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBoth men are Muslims.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu, Lawan, APC Governors Campaign For Oyetola In Osogbo\n\nMr Lawal, who backed Tinubu during the APC presidential primaries, said the choice of Mr Shettima was a sign that the APC presidential candidate has \u201cbeen cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe northern governors and some northern moslem elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them,\u201d Mr Lawal said.\n\n\u201cBut if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\u201d\n\nRead Mr Babachir\u2019s full note below:\n\nI thought I will be able to avoid commenting on the disastrous error by my very good friend, Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his choice of a running mate.\n\nI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency. This is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria.\n\nIt will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming. I have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians but most of whom are moslems) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a moslem-moslem ticket towards which I sensed they were drifting.\n\nAs part of my obligation to him, a close friend, I had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of both ticket permutations to him. I have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise, done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends. In all instances I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to\n\nbear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the Presidential ticket permutations.\n\nTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to every one. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests. But I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits. They will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do any thing to curry his favor and to also put well-meaning associates in bad light. I suspect this is what has\n\nhappened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\nIt never used to be like this. While in his hay-days in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell truth to power. He had Rauph Aregbesola, Yomi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.The Lagos days were the days of think-tanks, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But\n\nthese people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems living my friend stranded. Nature they say abhors vacuum.\n\nWelcome the Abuja equivalent. But the Abuja equivalent are people inflicted with the modern Nigerian diseases \u2013 religious bigotry, sycophancy and morbid tribalism. They are mostly political jobbers who are most times not averse to the application of diabolical means. Gone are the days of think-tanks, and strategic planning. Gone are the days of principles and ideologies. Try and call a meeting; they will not attend. Try and make a plan; they will sabotage it. Everything is ad-hoc, everything is chaotic because they excel in such environments. The result is that they have played on his longterm ambition to be President and have built it into a sort of desperation and a crescendo that easily justifies this satanic resort to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. This is the calamity that has befallen my\n\nfriend.\n\nAnd why Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs. And as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\nBut as a popular proverb goes: \u201cThose whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u201d. It appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its Presidential Candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Ibrahim for this purpose. Alhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashima\u2019s two hands are always in his plain sight and empty.\n\nTrue, based on the advise of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the out come of that choice. He has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their\n\nvotes. But he must also be told that there will consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy. This could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c. APC the great! Wu na de try woh!\n\nThe northern governors and some northern moslem elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he\n\nshould have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\nProof of a possible Islamic agenda was leaked when Governor Ganduje, the \u201cKadmul Islam\u201d, gave advance notice that Tinubu had assured them he would be nominating a moslem as his running mate. For those who might not know, Governor Ganduje has a foundation called \u201cGanduje Foundation\u201d which purpose according to its website is to \u201cprovide selfless service to humanity and Islam\u201d but whose primary purpose it appears is the conversion of Christians to Islam.\n\nSo if my very good friend Tinubu in a desperate bid to become President allows himself to made into a religious bigot or even a mujahideen, he is welcome. But it is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, were he to win and become President of Nigeria, it will be as a sectional President; an Islamic President. And he will surely face\n\nmassive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\nExpecting Nigerians to ignore this crass insensitivity to the country\u2019s diversity amounts to acceding to the perpetration of very grave injustice and discrimination against a huge segment of the society. No one who seeks to be president of Nigeria should ever deploy the tool of religious extremism and exclusivism as a tool to win elections. This is very very\n\ndangerous. And this is very sad.\n\nBut, baring any last minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic\n\nof Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There is gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the moslem ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding NO.\n\nHow then do we respond? The decision as to how to respond to this deliberately senseless act of provocation is both corporate to each religious group and also personal to each voter that love peace, and hate injustice. Christians want to continue to leave peacefully with their moslem neighbors at home, at school, at the work place, in the markets and on the streets as we have always done or desired to do. And I am sure Moslems share this view too. No one person\u2019s ambition to rule over us should be allowed\n\nto set us apart and at war with one another.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Mohammed Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-inChief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded.\n\nThere is a story in the bible on how some people responded to similar provocation: \u201cAnd when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king,\n\n\u201cWhat portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.\u201d So Israel went to their tents\u201d (1 Kings 12:16).\n\nI will love for Bola to be our next President. But I am afraid a Moslem-Moslem ticket will be \u201cDead on Arrival\u201d. And the arrival date according to INEC\u2019s election time table is 25th February, 2023. This ticket will drag down the whole APC members to the pit. We all should reject it.\n\nEngr. Babachir Lawal",

Our efforts in this regard have started to yield fruits.\n\n\u201cLast week, in Berlin, Germany, we signed the agreement for the repatriation of 1,130 Benin bronzes which were looted from the ancient city of Benin kingdom in 1897.\n\n\u201cThis number represents the single largest repatriation of looted works of art anywhere in the world. There is no doubt that the return of the most coveted Benin bronzes to Nigeria will help to stimulate domestic tourism in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed, however urged investors to work on promoting Nigerian as the choice destination for investors.\n\nHe said the new hotel, which attempts to promote Nigerian arts and crafts, accommodates a gallery with an extensive display of diverse Nigerian arts for public viewing in celebration of Nigeria\u2019s rich and vibrant culture.\n\n\u201cThe Art Hotel brand is a new offering associated with art, style, culture, sophistication and contemporary creativity that promises quality service and genuine guest experiences to deliver customer satisfaction in a distinctive environment.\n\n\u201cThis project had been strategically crafted to showcase our unique art, innovativeness and creative works. The choice of Lagos for siting this hotel is strategic, Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s economic hub where opportunities for expression abound and new stories of success and achievements unfold every day.\n\n\u201cStakeholders are also invited to package and promote Nigeria\u2019s destinations, goods and services. This will create direct and indirect employment through tourism, grow the economy, increase the national GDP, position Nigeria as an all year-round tourism destination and establish a worthwhile, acceptable and recognisable image of the country among tourists and travelers,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Mohammed commended the owners and sponsors of the hotel for the huge investment in the project, saying it revealed a deep understanding of the role of arts and culture on nation building.\n\n\u201cThe domestic tourism industry in Nigeria has enormous growth potential with huge possibilities for bringing in Foreign Direct Investments, infrastructural development, tourism asset development and the creation of local, national and international awareness for our tourism assets.\n\n\u201cThe sustainable development of this industry will preserve our tangible and intangible tourism assets, support tourism stakeholders and celebrate our cultural diversity, tourism assets and destinations. Overall, our vision is to promote best practices in the tourism industry that will ensure its sustainability and make Nigeria a globally-accepted and acclaimed destination for all manners of visitors.\u201d\n\nDeputy-Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, said the government would continue to bridge the infrastructural gap in the state to support the private sector.\n\n\u201cGrowing Lagos is a partnership between the government and private sector. The state investment in building key road infrastructure within the location is to support businesses,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oniru of Iru land in Lagos, Oba Gbolahan Lawal, stressed that value would be consistently added to the property and every other property within the area.\n\nHe thanked the hoteliers for leveraging the infrastructure the state government and his predecessors had put in place in the area.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful edifice. I am happy to be the monarch on the throne today, I love arts and architecture. I have not seen anything like this in this area. I hereby commend the architect and builder. It is a beautiful hotel and I recommend it to everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nArts Hotel CEO, Tunji Abdul said: \u201cWe must stay loyal to Nigeria and believe that businesses can survive once you are resolute and determined to succeed in the country.\n\n\u201cThe past seven years was not easy, but we positioned ourselves to meet the demands of all art lovers and are certain that the industry will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlso the General Manager of the Art Hotel, Mr. Roderick Peck said the hotel would serve individuals with excellence and style \u201cas fantastic menu would always be available.\u201d\n\nOluchi Chibuzor",

          "text": "A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal on Tuesday, wrote a letter to his friend and presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, telling him that his decision to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket would have consequences, because he has taken sides against Christians.\n\nLawal, who located the grounds for his displeasure in a popular saying \u2013 \u2018Those whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u2019 \u2013 to further underscore the implication of what Tinubu had done, lamented that sycophants always have greater influence on leaders, adding that, Tinubu has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\nThe Adamawa-born politician and administrator, said, he had thought he would be able to avoid commenting on the \u201cdisastrous error by my very good friend, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his choice of a running mate\u201d, because \u201cI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency. This is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to invoke his powers as the leader of the party to revoke Shettima\u2019s nomination, adding that the former Borno State governor was overambitious with a Machiavellian bent to his politics..\n\nThis is as a Tonye Princewill, a former governorship candidate of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) in Rivers State and ally of former Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, resigned his membership of the APC, because he could not defend its presidential combination.\n\nBuilding up to his disappointment, Lawal said, \u201cIt will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming. I have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians, but most of whom are Muslims) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a Muslim-muslim ticket towards, which I sensed they were drifting.\n\n\u201cAs part of my obligation to him, a close friend, I had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of both ticket permutations to him. I have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise, done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends.\n\n\u201cIn all instances, I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end, the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to bear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well-meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the presidential ticket permutations.\u201d\n\nLawal, who established that, \u201cTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to every one. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests,\u201d added that, \u201cBut I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits.\n\n\u201cThey will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do any thing to curry his favour and to also put well-meaning associates in bad light. I suspect this is what has happened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\n\u201cIt never used to be like this. While in his hay-day in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell truth to power. He had Rauf Aregbesola, Yemi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos days were the days of think-tanks, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But these people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems living my friend stranded. Nature they say abhors vacuum.\u201d\n\nDescribing Kashim Shetima as an overambitious man with Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs, he added that, \u201cAnd as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially, from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\n\u201cTrue, based on the advice of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the outcome of that choice. He has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim, he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their votes.\n\n\u201cBut he must also be told that there will consequences for this choice. Some of them are that, Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy. This could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cNow tell me, which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c. APC the great! Wu na de try woh!\u201d\n\nHe was of the opinion that, \u201cThe northern governors and some northern muslim elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons, because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\n\u201cBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Muhammadu Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-in-Chief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu.\u201d\n\nPrincewill Quits APC over Muslim-Muslim Ticket\n\nMeanwhile, Princewill, in a letter, affirmed that, his resignation was in protest against the choice of Shettima as running mate to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn the resignation letter addressed to the Chairman of Ward 3 (Royal Ward), Buguma City, in Asari Toru Local Government Area area, he said he could not continue to \u201cargue for equity in my state and defend inequity in my country.\n\n\u201cWhile I appreciate my leader, Rt Hon Rotimi Amaechi, and all his efforts, I cannot defend the decision of my party, in fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket, especially, at a time like this, against all protestations from well-meaning Nigerians, across religious and political divides.\n\n\u201cIt sets a very wrong precedent; it is totally insensitive and even if you win, will prove bad for good governance. Under these dire circumstances, I find no justification to still remain, in good conscience, a member of a political party that subordinates electoral victory, over the safety of lives and the peace of mind of its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe men and women of our party here in Rivers are the most loyal and faithful supporters I have met. They know right and they know wrong. And they know me. I enjoyed working with them and I\u2019m so sad to leave.\n\n\u201cBut an APC party that totally disregards the basics of the same equity we preach, is alien to me. Buhari resisted the same temptation and chose a little known Osinbajo and won. I wish you well. And I remain grateful to our leader, but I cannot defend the indefensible. And to be totally honest, neither should you.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY",
          "summary": "Building up to his disappointment, Lawal said, \u201cIt will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming.\nIt will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy.\n\u201cNow tell me, which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c.\n\u201cBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision.\n\u201cBut an APC party that totally disregards the basics of the same equity we preach, is alien to me.",
