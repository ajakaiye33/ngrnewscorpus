          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nThe cry of a newborn erases every pain the mother might have felt during childbirth, especially for those that went under the knife and had ceaseran section delivery. However, as days become months, another type of debilitating pain resurfaces for some mothers \u2013 lower back pain. Some mothers dealing with this challenge lamented that the pain has affected their ability to function effectively months after delivery. AMARACHI OKEH reports.\n\nFor Ugochukwu Okoye, a mother of three, dealing with lower back pain has been a major health challenge she has had to contend with for years.\n\nThe challenge, she said, has not been difficult, noting that she has had to endure the sharp, searing pains that began months after her delivery.\n\nAccording to Ugochukwu, the lower back pain is not unconnected with her delivery through the ceaseran section.\n\nThe lower back pains, she said, affected her mobility, ability to function effectively, and ability to do other several things that include taking care of the newborn.\n\nUgochukwu like other women spoken to by PUNCH HealthWise recalled that they started experiencing the lower back pain after the CS, noting that they suspected that it could have been caused by the epidurals they were given to numb the body and ease the CS pain.\n\nAccording to WebMD, an epidural is an injection that goes into a woman\u2019s \u201cepidural space,\u201d which is right outside of the membrane that protects the spinal cord.\n\nIt explained that doctors use epidural injections to relieve pain during and after surgery, as well as manage chronic pain.\n\n\u201cThis procedure isn\u2019t right for every case. But if it\u2019s an option, it requires a lower dose of medicine and as a result, has fewer side effects. Epidurals may even give you longer-lasting pain relief while helping you stay more alert and mobile,\u201d WebMD stated.\n\nI never suffered any pain in my body until I started having kids\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH Healthwise, Ugochukwu Okoye, said lower back pain was alien to her until after the birth of her first child through C/S.\n\nThe mother of three recounted that sadly, she lost the baby after delivery, only for her to almost become demobilised by severe lower back pain a month later.\n\nOkoye said she endured the pain, which only stopped after she got pregnant with her second child. She recalled that the same debilitating pain returned months after another delivery through C/S, adding that she also had the same experience after having her third child.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have never suffered any form of pain, especially in my lower back, until I had my first baby via C/S. Though I lost the child at birth but started having chronic back pain that ran between the waist to my spine, especially at the spot where I was given an epidural.\n\n\u201cIt continued for months until I took in for my second child. Two months after the surgery I started having the same severe lower back pain again. The same experience repeated itself with my third child. All through the three experiences, I couldn\u2019t sit for long. If I sat for 30 minutes to one hour, the pain would become so unbearable.\u201d\n\nMrs. Ugochukwu said she complained to her doctor, a certified gynaecologist and obstetrician, and was told that the pain was a result of the epidural shot she was given before the C/S commenced.\n\nThe woman told PUNCH Healthwise that she had to consult a therapist, who recommended regular exercise for her.\n\nShe said, \u201cAfter a while, I saw a therapist, who encouraged me to engage in aerobics, especially Yoga. That was what helped me to recover.\u201d\n\nI still suffer lower back pains eight months after childbirth\n\nAnother mother, Mrs. Yemisi told PUNCH Healthwise that she started experiencing lower back pain eight months after having her baby via C/S.\n\nShe said the pain felt as though she was being pierced with a needle at the exact spot where had an epidural shot.\n\nShe said, \u201cI feel a sharp pain in the area where I was injected with the epidural. It is not mild; it feels like someone wants to inject you with something.\u201d\n\nJust like Okoye, Yemisi said she never had lower back pain until after her two children which she had through CS.\n\nShe said, \u201cI started having back pain immediately when I left the theatre room. You know after giving birth through CS you are asked to lie down for six hours. I did all that but when I wanted to stand up that was when I started feeling the pains.\n\n\u201cBut as days went by, I got some relief due to the medications I was given but I was warned not to carry heavy things. But I have to get certain things done so any time I try to carry heavy things I feel a sharp pain.\n\n\u201cWhen I bend down to do some work for a very long time and stand up, I feel the pain, or sometimes when I carry the baby in the back for a very long time, I also feel the back pain.\n\nSpeaking on why she didn\u2019t consider it an issue to report to her gynaecologist, Yemisi said she felt it was a normal experience for women who gave birth through CS.\n\nShe said, \u201cI didn\u2019t meet the doctor because I feel almost every woman that passed through CS has that same complaint and also I feel it worsened because I am adamant to do certain things that the doctor advised me against doing.\u201d\n\nLower back pain after birth through CS coincidental and unlikely\n\nHowever, fertility and reproductive health experts have said it is quite unlikely for epidurals or CS to cause the lower back pain experienced by some women after childbirth.\n\nProfessor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Oluwarotimi Akinola and said that epidurals or CS do not have any effect on the woman\u2019s back.\n\nAkinola, who is a former president of Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria, said while he doubts that epidurals can cause back pains after birth, there\u2019s always the issue of local trauma which will subsequently heal, he said.\n\nDr. Akinde, who is also a former Chairman, Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria, Lagos Chapter said it could be coincidental that women who gave birth through CS experience lower back pain after putting to bed.\n\nHe noted that in pregnancy, there is an increase in the curvature of the spin in the lower back in the lumbosacral region that may cause a displacement of the vertebrae and it is this displacement that may cause lower back pain rather than the epidural anaesthesia that was administered.\n\nThe gynaecological experts also explained that not all women suffer from lower back pain after delivery while some women are prone to it.\n\nRepeated pregnancies dispose women to lower back pain\n\nGiving further insight into why some mothers suffer lower back pain, Akinde revealed that women who have more than one child are most likely to suffer from the pain irrespective of the mode of delivery.\n\nHe said, \u201cA woman who has one child is not likely to have this lower back pain but with repeated pregnancies, she\u2019s probably going to have it.\u2019\n\nHe explained that \u201cWith your first pregnancy it may not be much of a problem because the displacement may not be much but with repeated pregnancy that displacement gets worsened and then you are more likely to suffer lower back pain.\u201d\n\nAs the woman\u2019s abdomen is protruding forward, the bone at the back curves in so there\u2019s kind of a relative displacement in the course of pregnancy, Akinde explained.\n\nLower back pain after pregnancy reversible\n\nGetting relief from the condition may not be difficult as the gynaecologists say that it can be reversed with exercises and correct posturing.\n\nAkinola urged pregnant women to walk erect instead of pushing their chest out as it impacts their back.\n\nHe agreed that \u201cback pain after pregnancy could happen but can be reversed with exercise but it is also safe to look out for the reason why it happened so one does not overlook some things.\u201d\n\nHe advised women who may be experiencing such severe lower back pain to visit their neurosurgeon or an orthopaedic surgeon to rule out the possibility of a slipped disc or tuberculosis of the spin after which the medical expert \u201cwould then decide if what she needs is exercise so when you do those exercises more often than not everything gets back to normal.\u201d\n\nAkinde also added that to combat this pain, mothers should squat rather than bend, and sit erect while breastfeeding.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Alexander Okere\n\nJosiah Nwankpa, a 56-year-old broadcaster from the Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area of Abia State, who lost his sight to cataract in 2021 and is battling retina bleeding caused by diabetes shares his ordeal with ALEXANDER OKERE\n\nFor how long have you been a broadcaster?\n\nI came into broadcasting in 1991 with Radio Nigeria; as of that time, it was Radio Nigeria 1 but now, it is Choice FM. I was there when Bond FM was created. I was a Pidgin English announcer and Igbo newscaster at that time. I worked with Radio Lagos. I went to OGBC 2 FM where I worked for over seven years. I was also a freelancer with radio stations. I worked with Star FM for three years then I went back to Metro FM as a freelancer. I presented programmes like \u2018Make We Talk Business\u2019 on Radio Nigeria and \u2018Make We Laugh Small\u2019 on OGBC 2. Now, I work with Daar Communications, owner of AIT, Raypower and Faaji Fm, where I am a newscaster, presenter and producer. I present a family programme, \u2018Make We Talk with Josiah Nwankpa\u2019. I also present the news in Pidgin English.\n\nCan you recall how you lost your sight?\n\nI was sick for about a year and after the illness, my vision went bad; images appeared to be doubled. I thought it was caused by the malaria and typhoid I had or the injection I received. I thought my vision would improve, unknown to me that it was far from what I thought. I became inquisitive and went to an eye clinic where, I was told that I had cataracts. I was referred to a Catholic eye hospital in Ago Iwoye. The doctors there did everything they could, but eventually said they could not handle it. They advised me to go to the University College Hospital, Ibadan, and specifically told me to meet a particular doctor. When I got there, I was referred to three private hospitals in Lagos and I went to one of them, an Indian eye clinic. One of the doctors who examined me told me I was bleeding in the eyes, that my retina shifted and that I also have a cataract. That was how I got to know that I have cataract. That was in 2021.\n\nHow did you feel when you realised it was that serious?\n\nOh, I felt bad. I thought about the things I had planned to do and felt bad. The doctor said the solution was to undergo an operation.\n\nWhen did you eventually lose your sight?\n\nI was in the process of moving from one hospital to another when I observed that I could no longer see; everything became white. Some of the eyedrops were so peppery that they left me unable to do anything for a day or two.\n\nDid the doctor explain why you were bleeding in your eyes?\n\nHe said it was due to pressure in the eyes from the diabetes I have.\n\nWas this something you already knew?\n\nI have diabetes. My mother had diabetes.\n\nHow has the condition affected your job?\n\nI am a newscaster but I can\u2019t read news now. When the problem started, I felt bad because I knew it would affect my job. At one point, I had to memorise the news script, instead of reading from the script. I used to use a flashlight to memorise the script. When I got to the studio, I kept making mistakes. It was difficult for me to tell my colleague\u2019s that I had a problem. It was when the mistakes became unbearable that I had to tell the managing director that I had an issue with my eyes and would require some treatment. My condition is killing my dream.\n\nWhat did your MD tell you?\n\nHe told me to treat it as soon as possible.\n\nDid you lose your job?\n\nI am still an employee but I have not been going to the office. I last went to work about a year ago. I was not laid off because my employer expects me to be back.\n\nAre you married with children?\n\nYes, I am married with four kids. I married a woman from Okene in Kogi State. I married an Igbira woman.\n\nHow are your wife and kids coping with your condition?\n\nHmm. It is a difficult situation. The woman has not been steady since she discovered that I have an issue with my eyes.\n\nNot steady in what way?\n\nNot steady in the sense that I found out that she feels bad about the situation. At times, the way she does things shows that she is frustrated and maybe needs to abandon the marriage.\n\nIs she still with you?\n\nShe is not with me now.\n\nAre you saying that she left you?\n\nSomething like that. She lives with our children in Ibadan.\n\nDid she tell you that she would leave?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to say because it is difficult. I think she is tired of the marriage; she is frustrated.\n\nWhy do you think she is frustrated?\n\nI think it is because of my eye problem and the diabetes.\n\nHow did you find out that she left with your children?\n\nShe told one of my brothers that they were going to leave.\n\nDid she give him a reason?\n\nShe gave flimsy excuses.\n\nLike what?\n\nLike quarrelling with me and that I did not give her the chance.\n\nThe chance to do what?\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat was the last conversation you had with her before she left?\n\nIn our last conversation, she told me that she was not leaving, that she wanted to just stay away for some time. She told me this through messages she sent to me.\n\nDid you try to persuade her to stay?\n\nI told her not to leave me because I still love her.\n\nHow has her departure affected you?\n\nIt is painful. My brothers are not in Lagos where I reside, so I am left with the option of learning how to do things by myself. I am familiar with the corners of my apartment and have learnt to do certain things by myself, like turning on a gas cylinder, though I sustain injuries along the line. I also get help from some friends from the church I attend.\n\nDid the doctor at the private clinic assure you that your sight would be restored after the surgery?\n\nThat is what the Indian doctor has been telling me. He said I would be fine after the surgery. I believe him because the doctors who referred me to him said if the doctor said he could not treat the problem, I should just go home and not bother wasting my money.\n\nHow much will the treatment cost you?\n\nI was told that it would cost about N3m and between N4m and N5m, if the other expenses, like expensive drugs, are added. They said a lot of things had to be done after the surgery.\n\nHave you been able to raise the money?\n\nIt has been very difficult. I spent the little money I had, moving from one hospital to the other and taking tests and moving from one state to the other. I went to different hospitals in Ogun, Akwa Ibom and Abia states.\n\nHow much have you spent so far?\n\nI have spent more than N2m. An injection I receive to manage the eyes costs N110,000.\n\nHave you received any support from family and friends?\n\nYes, I have been receiving support but not the kind I need to raise the money. I am appealing to members of the public to help raise some money for my eye surgery. I have been in pain since my wife and kids left. I don\u2019t know how they measure the pain when I consider the emotions and love I have for her and my kids.\n\nHow old is your eldest child?\n\nMy eldest child is about 19 years old.\n\nWho stayed with you when you were at the clinic?\n\nWhen the problem started, my wife was there. I am at home now because I cannot afford to stay in the clinic and pay the bills.\n\nDo your children contact you?\n\nYes, the younger ones call me.\n\nDoes your wife call you?\n\nShe only sends messages on WhatsApp but I can\u2019t read them and can\u2019t tell someone to do that for me because they are private chats. I don\u2019t want people in the neighbourhood and at work to know that she is no longer around.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Alexander Okere\n\nJosiah Nwankpa, a 56-year-old broadcaster from the Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area of Abia State, who lost his sight to cataract in 2021 and is battling retina bleeding caused by diabetes shares his ordeal with ALEXANDER OKERE\n\nFor how long have you been a broadcaster?\n\nI came into broadcasting in 1991 with Radio Nigeria; as of that time, it was Radio Nigeria 1 but now, it is Choice FM. I was there when Bond FM was created. I was a Pidgin English announcer and Igbo newscaster at that time. I worked with Radio Lagos. I went to OGBC 2 FM where I worked for over seven years. I was also a freelancer with radio stations. I worked with Star FM for three years then I went back to Metro FM as a freelancer. I presented programmes like \u2018Make We Talk Business\u2019 on Radio Nigeria and \u2018Make We Laugh Small\u2019 on OGBC 2. Now, I work with Daar Communications, owner of AIT, Raypower and Faaji Fm, where I am a newscaster, presenter and producer. I present a family programme, \u2018Make We Talk with Josiah Nwankpa\u2019. I also present the news in Pidgin English.\n\nCan you recall how you lost your sight?\n\nI was sick for about a year and after the illness, my vision went bad; images appeared to be doubled. I thought it was caused by the malaria and typhoid I had or the injection I received. I thought my vision would improve, unknown to me that it was far from what I thought. I became inquisitive and went to an eye clinic where, I was told that I had cataracts. I was referred to a Catholic eye hospital in Ago Iwoye. The doctors there did everything they could, but eventually said they could not handle it. They advised me to go to the University College Hospital, Ibadan, and specifically told me to meet a particular doctor. When I got there, I was referred to three private hospitals in Lagos and I went to one of them, an Indian eye clinic. One of the doctors who examined me told me I was bleeding in the eyes, that my retina shifted and that I also have a cataract. That was how I got to know that I have cataract. That was in 2021.\n\nHow did you feel when you realised it was that serious?\n\nOh, I felt bad. I thought about the things I had planned to do and felt bad. The doctor said the solution was to undergo an operation.\n\nWhen did you eventually lose your sight?\n\nI was in the process of moving from one hospital to another when I observed that I could no longer see; everything became white. Some of the eyedrops were so peppery that they left me unable to do anything for a day or two.\n\nDid the doctor explain why you were bleeding in your eyes?\n\nHe said it was due to pressure in the eyes from the diabetes I have.\n\nWas this something you already knew?\n\nI have diabetes. My mother had diabetes.\n\nHow has the condition affected your job?\n\nI am a newscaster but I can\u2019t read news now. When the problem started, I felt bad because I knew it would affect my job. At one point, I had to memorise the news script, instead of reading from the script. I used to use a flashlight to memorise the script. When I got to the studio, I kept making mistakes. It was difficult for me to tell my colleague\u2019s that I had a problem. It was when the mistakes became unbearable that I had to tell the managing director that I had an issue with my eyes and would require some treatment. My condition is killing my dream.\n\nWhat did your MD tell you?\n\nHe told me to treat it as soon as possible.\n\nDid you lose your job?\n\nI am still an employee but I have not been going to the office. I last went to work about a year ago. I was not laid off because my employer expects me to be back.\n\nAre you married with children?\n\nYes, I am married with four kids. I married a woman from Okene in Kogi State. I married an Igbira woman.\n\nHow are your wife and kids coping with your condition?\n\nHmm. It is a difficult situation. The woman has not been steady since she discovered that I have an issue with my eyes.\n\nNot steady in what way?\n\nNot steady in the sense that I found out that she feels bad about the situation. At times, the way she does things shows that she is frustrated and maybe needs to abandon the marriage.\n\nIs she still with you?\n\nShe is not with me now.\n\nAre you saying that she left you?\n\nSomething like that. She lives with our children in Ibadan.\n\nDid she tell you that she would leave?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to say because it is difficult. I think she is tired of the marriage; she is frustrated.\n\nWhy do you think she is frustrated?\n\nI think it is because of my eye problem and the diabetes.\n\nHow did you find out that she left with your children?\n\nShe told one of my brothers that they were going to leave.\n\nDid she give him a reason?\n\nShe gave flimsy excuses.\n\nLike what?\n\nLike quarrelling with me and that I did not give her the chance.\n\nThe chance to do what?\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat was the last conversation you had with her before she left?\n\nIn our last conversation, she told me that she was not leaving, that she wanted to just stay away for some time. She told me this through messages she sent to me.\n\nDid you try to persuade her to stay?\n\nI told her not to leave me because I still love her.\n\nHow has her departure affected you?\n\nIt is painful. My brothers are not in Lagos where I reside, so I am left with the option of learning how to do things by myself. I am familiar with the corners of my apartment and have learnt to do certain things by myself, like turning on a gas cylinder, though I sustain injuries along the line. I also get help from some friends from the church I attend.\n\nDid the doctor at the private clinic assure you that your sight would be restored after the surgery?\n\nThat is what the Indian doctor has been telling me. He said I would be fine after the surgery. I believe him because the doctors who referred me to him said if the doctor said he could not treat the problem, I should just go home and not bother wasting my money.\n\nHow much will the treatment cost you?\n\nI was told that it would cost about N3m and between N4m and N5m, if the other expenses, like expensive drugs, are added. They said a lot of things had to be done after the surgery.\n\nHave you been able to raise the money?\n\nIt has been very difficult. I spent the little money I had, moving from one hospital to the other and taking tests and moving from one state to the other. I went to different hospitals in Ogun, Akwa Ibom and Abia states.\n\nHow much have you spent so far?\n\nI have spent more than N2m. An injection I receive to manage the eyes costs N110,000.\n\nHave you received any support from family and friends?\n\nYes, I have been receiving support but not the kind I need to raise the money. I am appealing to members of the public to help raise some money for my eye surgery. I have been in pain since my wife and kids left. I don\u2019t know how they measure the pain when I consider the emotions and love I have for her and my kids.\n\nHow old is your eldest child?\n\nMy eldest child is about 19 years old.\n\nWho stayed with you when you were at the clinic?\n\nWhen the problem started, my wife was there. I am at home now because I cannot afford to stay in the clinic and pay the bills.\n\nDo your children contact you?\n\nYes, the younger ones call me.\n\nDoes your wife call you?\n\nShe only sends messages on WhatsApp but I can\u2019t read them and can\u2019t tell someone to do that for me because they are private chats. I don\u2019t want people in the neighbourhood and at work to know that she is no longer around.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

The DG stated.\n\n\u201cWe are however doing a lot to unlock that potential and put a stop to the importation of new and fairly used vehicles into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs am speaking, there are individuals and companies that are believed in the current and future economy of Nigeria, enough to invest this huge amount of money.\u201d He explained.\n\nHe said the NADDC is in consultation with other multinational companies such as Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan to come and directly set up their production plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201d The council is working to effectively implement an automotive policy agenda, with a view to bringing these companies back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBecause, when these companies come in, they will invest hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey want to have a guarantee that regardless of whichever government is in power their investments will be protected,\u201d DG said.\n\nAccording to the director-general, the council has also engaged an international firm, KPMG, to review the automotive policy.\n\nThis, he averred, is to make it now in tune with the extant global movement in producing vehicles.\n\nHe recalled how in the \u201970s and 80s firms like Peugeot, Volkswagen, Anamco and Leyland were producing over 140,000 vehicles per year and suddenly stopped.\n\nAliyu said,\u201dall that stopped overnight because the prices of crude oil that the country was so dependent on as a resource dropped from $27 per barrel to below $10.\n\n\u201cSo, overnight, Nigeria went into recession, overnight, Nigerians became poor, those people who could buy new 504s, new 505s and beetles could no longer do that.\n\n\u201cSo, these companies could no longer sell their products, rey forced to leave because of market forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cNADDC is working tirelessly to bring back that lost glory and discourage heavy reliance on imported used cars by Nigerians\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are diligently implementing the National Automotive Industry Development Plan ( NAIDP), to reverse the ugly trend.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that vehicles produced in Nigeria had the same standard qualities as those imported, \u201cif not even better than them.",

It would have also created jobs for the youth and showed that the government was committed to an enabling environment through its zero-oil policy to encourage the youths in works that would meet standards for export.\n\n\u201cAt APFFLON,\u201d Ogunojemite added, \u201cwe do call on the Minister of Aviation to wield his supervisory powers to get the project established for the overall good of the nation even as we draw your attention to the fact that NAHCO and its crony, Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCOL) PLC, have collaborated to increase ground handling charges by 70 percent and successfully collects these new fees for almost two years.\u201d\n\nNigerian Export Promotion Council, NEPC has linked poor packaging and labelling as the major challenges confronting Nigerian export products overseas.\n\nThe Director, Business Development at NEPC, William Eze in Lagos, recently said Nigerian products destined for export, especially to the US market, have been faced with poor packaging which resulted in rejections. \u201cA recent report says that 30 per cent of our (Nigeria) exports to the US are rejected as a result of poor packaging and labelling, not quality of the products,\u201d he said.\n\nSame with the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), among others, who have also lamented that due to a lack of quality control and poor packaging, hundreds of containers loaded with \u2018Made in Nigeria\u2019 products are being rejected in the international market and are returned home.",

          "title": "My grouse with Osinbajo \u2013 Dele Momodu",
          "text": "Presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dele Momodu, is seen by many as a lightweight, going by the number of big career politicians he is up against in the race for the party\u2019s sole ticket. However, the businessman publisher of Ovation International magazine is not cowed as he insists he is a global brand. He spoke with Gboyega Alaka about his upbringing, career,presidential aspiration and his misgivings about Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, among other issues.\n\nYOU come across as a son of nobody rising to flex with the high and mighty. How was that possible?\n\nThere is always the God factor in the life of every man. I was born into an Aladura church in Ile Ife in 1960. My father died when I was barely 13 years old, and I was left with an unlettered mum. It was tough after my father died. So during my holidays, I had to look for a job because my mum was poor. I got a job as a cleaner at CSS Bookshop in Ile Ife. After that, I became a village teacher; after that I became a library attendant at the University of Ife library before I became a student there. I read voraciously, and by the time I became a student, I was already in touch with Prof Wole Soyinka, who was a lecturer on campus at that time. I said I wanted to be like him.\n\nThough I studied Yoruba as my first degree, I was already in love with literature in English. That\u2019s why after my first degree, I went to do a masters in literature. And I was the only Nigerian who had gone that route. So I have always been a rebel, a child of destiny, a child of diversity. Even my life story is a lesson. I came to Lagos in 1988; I wanted to be a teacher and I couldn\u2019t get a job; and that was why I came to Lagos in the first place. The Guardian was where I was writing and they were paying me N25 per article; but when I went to the same Guardian for a job, they said there was no job for me. I almost died. Then Onukaba Adinoyi-ojo \u2013 God bless his soul \u2013 said let\u2019s go to Concord newspaper; and I said, \u2018Oh no, Abiola\u2019s paper?\u2019 And that was because they had really damaged his image at the time. And see life, unknown to me, my destiny was awaiting me in Concord. And that\u2019s when I learnt the lesson that you never judge a book by its cover. If not out of joblessness, I would not have gone there.\n\nIt looks a bit strange that you are contesting for presidency under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), a party you helped push out of power about seven years ago\u2026\n\nIn life, they say there are no permanent enemies or friends; there are permanent interests in politics. My case is better than that of some of my co-contestants in the sense that when I went against the PDP, I was not a member of the mainstream opposition. I was in the NCP (National Conscience Party). Number two, there were those who were in the party, like Atiku Abubakar, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, Aminu Tambuwal, Rabiu Kwankwaso, who all left the party to join the Buhari\u2019s party, the APC, and still came back. And if they can come back after fighting against their party, then in my own case, I am very innocent.\n\nYou would recall that I was a presidential candidate in 2011. One lesson I learnt then was that it is practically impossible to win a national election if you are not in a national party. There are only two national political parties in Nigeria as we speak \u2013 the APC and the PDP. And since I had already given up on the APC, the only other option I had was the PDP.\n\nYou were also a big fan of General Muhammadu Buhari going into the 2015 elections until you switched. At what point did it actually dawn on you that you had had enough?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I was a big fan. I supported him based on a few assumptions. The first was that Buhari after 30 years of retirement would be a father figure, like a Nelson Mandela of Nigeria. Of course, I knew his limitations, but I expected that he would rely on the knowledge and expertise of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat, so that whatever he lacked, Osinbajo as VP would provide the counterbalance. Unfortunately, it\u2019s like they snuffed the life out of the VP and he became almost like a lame duck in many instances. It seemed he was more afraid for his job. One of the things I have against him, and we were quite close, was that he was more afraid of Buhari and the cabal.\n\nFor Buhari, I didn\u2019t just give up on him; I gave him a chance. I wrote memos to him. On one occasion, he invited me to Aso Rock and we had a one-on-one meeting. I liked him. He looked simple, so I don\u2019t know what happened to him. Maybe the ill health affected him. I don\u2019t know what the cabal did to him. Unfortunately, I realised he was not going in the right direction, and every advice I offered through my column on the back page of Thisday, because I promised him I was going to do that, fell on deaf ears. I even gave him an autographed compilation of my articles, on request. The point of departure for me was the division in Nigeria. The lack of unity. That really touched me.\n\nYou are contesting against political juggernauts and money bags for the PDP ticket. What is giving you the conviction that you could get the PDP nomination?\n\nYou see, my party will have to learn from its previous mistakes. We have to understand the mood of the nation. Most of the contestants are people who have either been vice president, senate president, House of Reps Speaker, senators, governors; all the big juggernauts. However, what makes an election is not the juggernauts; it is (i) your pedigree, (ii) your reputation (iii) your personal accomplishments. Leadership is about managing people and resources. So, the PDP will have to deliver something new to Nigerians. If all that the PDP has to offer are the same people that Nigerians have complained and given up on, then it will be difficult for us to dislodge the APC. PDP must show that they have the capacity for that new Nigeria, which we all crave. And who best to deliver that new Nigeria than a Dele Momodu? You can\u2019t have such a man donated to you and still be looking elsewhere.\n\nThere is this consensus pendulum hanging in both parties. How do you hope to deal with that?\n\nI expect a PDP that lost the election and was not able to win again in 2019, to know that they have to do something differently this time. That\u2019s what I am hinging my confidence on. When people say, why are you so confident? I tell them look, there is the God factor in everything. I\u2019ve just told you the story of my life, my trajectory. It\u2019s not every day that a country can produce a Dele Momodu. I\u2019m not trying to be immodest. And we\u2019ve seen it elsewhere. Look at Obama, he wasn\u2019t a hardcore politician. As far as I am concerned, the man is a Kenyan. Same with Donald Trump, MKO Abiola, Macron, and the president of Ukraine. Nigeria is the only country where we are still talking about juggernauts. What have these juggernauts achieved for Nigeria? Juggernauts of failure?\n\nForty million naira nomination form; a lot of your colleagues in the media have wondered how you would sign out such an outrageous sum for form.\n\nI am the only aspirant who complained publicly about the price of form at our national secretariat. It was a tug of war for me to raise the money because I don\u2019t have access to easy money. I almost couldn\u2019t raise that N40m. But I did something quite smart, I registered an account and sent it out on Facebook, Instagram and co, and people were donating. The least we got was N500. If one million Nigerians donate N1, 000 each, I will raise one billion. Politicians don\u2019t reason like that.\n\nWhat do you hope to do differently as president? Can you solve the insecurity problem?\n\nOh, I just told you that I\u2019m already solving it, by my actions and interactions across the country. If you make every Nigerian comfortable, if your people love you, they will flow with you. A president must be tolerant, he must love everybody. That is who Dele Momodu is. He must be the brand manager and image maker of Nigeria. Why is everybody going to Ghana? Perception. I\u2019ve followed President Mahama of Ghana to a few international conferences, and when he\u2019s talking, you would think he is a professor. That is what Nigeria needs. Nigeria needs intellectuals in government. We can then back him up with politicians. But a situation where two politicians are presented will not take us everywhere.\n\nWhat is your recipe for solving the economic problem?\n\nThe recipe is easy. You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have. People think economic theories can solve economic problems; if it could, we have them in abundance. Talk of the Bismark Rewanes, the Salamis; and they are close to the government. But if the man at the top does not even have an idea of what to do, it\u2019s always going to be a problem. I\u2019m a businessman. I grew a business in the last 26 years from the City of London with just 20,000 pounds. When social media became the vogue, we were able to diversify. Today, I have over 1.7milion followers on twitter. I am over sixty; there is no young man who can say that technically he is better than Dele Momodu on social media, apart from musicians. And theirs is based on fame. You can see my office; I operate all the gadgets myself. Because I have managed a business successfully, I know what it takes to create job opportunities for the people. Under my watch, there will be no wastage, because I will first of all downgrade my lifestyle. Then you must be able to build trust at home and abroad. Then of course, we would have to work urgently.\n\nThe number one problem facing business in Nigeria is electricity. I have all the contacts at home and abroad in the electricity business. We will also have to fix the problem of transmission. In Nigeria today, even if we generate 20,000 megawatt, there is no way of transmitting it. We also have to work on our bureaucracy. A leader must understand deadlines. If you don\u2019t give deadlines, before you know it, four years is up and you will start chasing a second term. I am not even bothered about being given a second term. That first term, I must build my legacy. Let Nigerians see it and support me or say \u2018Oh, this guy did not allow us to chop, kick him out.\n\nHow do you hope to address our dependency on imports, especially refined petrol importation?\n\nAgain, it is pure madness. There is no reason why our refineries should not work. This was one of the reasons we supported Buhari. We felt that as a former Minister of Petroleum many years ago, he would understand the issues behind the perennial crisis. Fortunately, I have the contacts and I know how it works elsewhere. I have been going to OPEC in Vienna as far back as 1998. You would be surprised. The first time I went, I wanted to recruit Dr. Rilwan Lukman to run as VP to Chief Olu Falae. I spent my own money to go on that trip. Unfortunately, that was when he told me about the owners of Nigeria and how they had settled for Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. I was disappointed, and that was when I first wrote about the owners of Nigeria.\n\nAre you not worried that these people are still there and they may have settled for their person even as we speak?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I have interacted with most of them. I have met the boss of all bosses, General Olusegun Obasanjo, who is a father figure and someone I respect. Of course I\u2019ve heard my criticism of him. General Ibrahim Babangida is one person that speaks fondly of me, and despite the fact that his administration put me in detention; I don\u2019t hold it against him. I am a very tolerant person and that is what Nigeria needs, not a vindictive person. If Mandela was a vindictive person, he would probably have killed all those who dealt with him. So I\u2019ve learnt a lot from studying and reading about world leaders. I am a much prepared leader. Even General Adulsalami Abubakar; they are all very fond of this village man, who is not a local champion but a global brand, and I\u2019m hoping that they would be able to translate this into supporting me. Currently I am reading My Story, the memoirs of the UAE leader, Sheik Muhammed bin Rashid Al Mahktoum. About 20 years ago, I was one of those who marketed Dubai to Nigeria.",

          "text": "By Olafioye Olakunle, Chinelo Obogo, Daniel Kanu, Chukwudi Nweje, Sunday Ani\n\nIt was a night of excellence and glamour yesterday at The Sun Awards as many eminent Nigerians were celebrated. The 19th edition of the prestigious The Sun Awards was held at the Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State said that it\u2019s possible to build a greater Nigeria with visionary leadership and unity among the people.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHis position was corroborated by Hon Chibuike Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, who noted also that Nigerians can create a new vision with good leadership.\n\nImo State governor, Hope Uzobimma also flayed opponents and critics of his government, saying that the state of insecurity in the state is the handwork of opposition.\n\nHe said that he would not be distracted from delivering democracy dividends to Imolites.\n\nHe thanked The Sun for the award which he described as unique even as he acknowledged that The Sun is one of the most widely read newspapers that reports authoritatively.\n\n\u201cI also thank the All Progressives Congress (APC) for giving me the opportunity to serve my people.

Singling them out 200 million Nigerians is an indication that there is something significant about them. I must say that it is one thing to win an award and another thing to maintain the standard that earns one an award. The onus is, therefore, on the award winners to continue doing their best in order not to descend from the point of excellence to a lower pedestal. They must remain great ambassadors of Nigeria and do everything to ensure that the things that earned them these awards are maintained,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed that the task of nation building was a collective one, especially now that the country is experiencing some difficulties.\n\nThe former Abia governor called on hands to be on deck to ensure that the current challenges facing the country were surmounted.\n\n\u201cWe will overcome our challenges when we collectively and sincerely tackle them, no matter our status in the society,\u201d he said.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Let us work together to deliver a better society, where our children and grand children will be proud to call home. It is something we can do. It is something we must do,\u201d he submitted.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the Chairman of the event and Methodist Bishop, Sunday Onuoha, also called on Nigerians to live in peace and harmony, noting that irrespective of tribe, culture, language or faith, it is God that has put all Nigerians together for a purpose.\n\nHe noted that in his many years of travelling and working with different people across the country, he has discovered that the only recipe for peace was to stop harping on the things that divide Nigerians and concentrate more on those things that unite them.\n\nBishop Onuoha decried the bloodshed occasioned by banditry, insurgency and kidnapping among other crimes in the country, saying that it was time for Nigeria to heal.\n\n\u201cOur nation has witnessed so much bloodshed. We have seen brutal banditry, insurgency, kidnapping and other sundry crimes. A time has come when righteousness should prevail in this nation. Nigeria, our country, needs healing.

I have followed how The Sun painstakingly, every year, selects people for various awards. Their choices have been quite good. The setting is always right. And the attendance is superb.\n\n\u201cI have seen The Sun Awards evolving from a sole award ceremony of Man of the Year award to a multifaceted award ceremony. The Sun, in its awards, has enlarged the themes and plots of the Nigerian success story, and by extension, the African success story in a globalized world, where Africa remains the new frontier of growth and development. The Sun Awards ceremony has unconsciously engendered the ethics of hard work among Nigerians, as people look forward to be called to stand before the world and be garlanded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief, The Sun Publishing Limited, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh said that the Award was a celebration of determination, excellence, hard work and accomplishments.\n\nHe noted that the 26 Nigerians that were honoured at the event had distinguished themselves in various spheres of human endeavours.\n\n\u201cThey cut across politics, trade and industry, real estate, sports, entertainment, hospitality, humanitarian services, public service, investment, banking and others. These men and women have proved that things can work in Nigeria, irrespective of our challenges. We call them the shining stars. Stars naturally shine. When a star is, therefore, qualified with the word \u2018shining,\u2019 that means that it is extraordinarily bright. That goes for the people we are honouring.\n\nBy what they have done for the socio-economic and political development of the country, they shine like a thousand stars, giving the people hope for a better Nigeria. We commend them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cOn behalf of the Board, Management and Staff of The Sun Publishing Limited, I am delighted to welcome you to the 19th Edition of The Sun Awards. We appreciate your presence tonight. We are grateful that at a political season and a time of other serious government, business and personal engagements, you have spared your precious time to celebrate with us. Thank you so much.\n\nHe described the process of selecting winners of the Awards as meticulous just as the process of organizing the Awards is rigorous.\n\n\u201cThe Sun Awards ceremony is consistent with the newspaper\u2019s vision of being a dominant media content provider and entertainment company in Nigeria and Africa, through the pursuit of excellence in delivering innovative and quality media and entertainment products. We have kept faith with this, remaining true to our cherished ideals, philosophy and values.\u201d\n\nHe said that the Award is expected to engender the ethics of hard work among Nigerians, and invariably produce more award winners in the future.\n\nHe charged the winners to continue to hold their heads high, never to lower the standard as only that would justify the honour that has been bestowed on them through the awards.\n\n\u201cFor the award winners, we say: Continue to excel. Do not lower the standard that has given you the award. Continue to be ambassadors of The Sun, by doing what would promote excellence and, therefore, justify always the garlands you wear today.\n\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, it is a night of celebration. Like in previous editions, this year\u2019s event, which is the celebration of 2021 achievers, promises to keep to the tradition of being the biggest media event.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party Party (PDP) is currently walking on a tightrope. Ahead of its May 28/ 29 presidential primary, controversy on whether or not the ticket should be zoned and the consequences, particularly litigations by some aggrieved members of the party, are now major cause of headache for the opposition party.\n\nAlready, a Federal High Court, in Abuja, has fixed May 10 for hearing of an ex-parte application seeking an injunction to restrain the PDP from going ahead with its presidential primary pending the determination of the a suit bordering on the zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket of the party.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe suit filed by a presidential aspirant, Cosmas Ndukwe, has as defendants the PDP, its National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu; National Secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu; and the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC).\n\nSunday Sun gathered that the leaders of the party are apprehensive that disagreement over the zoning of the presidential ticket and the resort to litigations by aggrieved members may affect the cohesion of the party in the run-up to the 2023 general elections.\n\nAlready, a total of 15 aspirants have been cleared to participate in the p presidential primary. While two aspirants were disqualified.\n\nThose cleared include former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed; former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; Aminu Tambuwal, Nyesom Wike, Emmanuel Udom, governors of Sokoto, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom states respectively.\n\nOthers are former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and former Senate President, Pius Anyim Pius; former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; former Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose and publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Our party is encouraged to always make the issue of zoning very clear at least six months before sales of forms. Our party should commend the efforts of some of our contestants on the issue of consensus candidacy; the efforts should be seen to a peaceful and logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nCuriously, the committee report is yet to be considered, about four weeks, after it was submitted to the NWC.\n\nThe delay, in the consideration of the report, it was gathered, is traceable to the tension the recommendation that the presidential ticket be thrown open is generating among stakeholders.\n\nThe PDP stakeholders from the South, including governors, see the recommendation that the presidential ticket be thrown open, as an attempt to subvert the party\u2019s constitution, which expressly stated that there shall be zoning of offices.\n\nThis school of thought believes that since the PDP 2019 presidential ticket was zoned to the North, it should be ceded to the South in 2023, especially as President Muhammadu Buhari, who is from the North would be completing two terms of eight years on May 29, 2023.\n\nSunday Sun reliably gathered that PDP NWC is worried on how to get stakeholders to form a consensus on the zoning of the presidential ticket.\n\nA highly placed source at the PDP national secretariat told Sunday Sun that the party leadership is concerned about the tension the zoning controversy is generating and is looking for ways to resolve it in a win-win manner for all party members.\n\nThere is especially as there are serious indications that the party might jettison zoning in the choice of its next presidential candidate.\n\nAlready, the NWC has convened a meeting of the PDP NEC for Wednesday. The NEC, which is the second highest organ is expected to take a definite stand on whether or not the 2023 presidential ticket should be zoned.\n\nRegardless, the zoning controversy assumed a new twist penultimate Thursday, as a presidential aspirant, Cosmas Ndukwe, filed a suit before a Federal High Court in Abuja, praying it to interpret Article 7 (3)(c) of the PDP constitution.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nArticle 7 (3)( c) stipulates that the party shall adhere \u201cto the policy of the rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness.\u201d\n\nHowever, that suit was to earn Ndukwe a disqualification from participating in the presidential primary.\n\nThe disqualification of Ndukwe, a former deputy speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, as well as Nwachukwu Anakwenze, it was gathered, was upheld by the Appeal Panel, consisting of members of the NWC and other top party shots.\n\nThere are fears that the disqualification of the two presidential aspirants may trigger a fresh legal case,in addition to the suit, already instituted by Ndukwe on the zoning controversy, ahead of the May 28/29 convention of the PDP, especially as the Electoral Act bars political parties from disqualifying aspirants.\n\nSection 84(3) of the Electoral Act states that \u201c a political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for election in its constitution, guidelines or rules for nomination of candidates for elections\u201d expect as prescribed in the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nA source told Sunday Sun that \u201clitigations are unwanted distractions. It is not what we need at this time. No doubt, the party may be right to have disqualified the candidates. But we must avoid anything that will lead to needles court cases. Don\u2019t forget we are an opposition party. So, we must be careful.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former deputy speaker, when contacted on his next line of action, told Sunday Sun, that the party has not communicated to him on the decision of the Appeal Panel, as it regards his appeal against his disqualification.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of the decision of the Appeal Panel. When we get to that bridge, we will cross it,\u201d Ndukwe told Sunday Sun.\n\nRegardless, most of the presidential aspirants are continuing with their various campaigns, after a push by Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed, Saraki and Hayatu-Deen to come up with consensus candidate ended in controversy.\n\nThe consensus project spear-headed by the group of four aspirants, collapsed recently, after the Northern Elders announced the Bauchi governor and Saraki as their consensus aspirants of the North for PDP presidential ticket.\n\nProf Ango Abdullahi in a communique, after a meeting of some northern elders, including former military President, Ibrahim Babangida, in Minna, the Niger State capital, noted that Mohammed and Saraki are expected to engage in further consultations, after which one of them will be chosen, as the main consensus candidate for the North.\n\nIronically, Saraki, after the group\u2019s meeting, with Enugu State governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, had said: \u201cI just want to be clear about that, and be reassured it is not about just issue of a northern consensus, not at all, it\u2019s a consensus for the PDP and one Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe selection of the Bauchi governor and Saraki as Northern consensus candidates did not go down well with Tambuwal and Hayatu-Deen, as well as some PDP stakeholders in the North.\n\nWhile Tambuwal and Hayatu-Deen rejected the consensus, the stakeholders led by Sule Lamido, at a press briefing, in Abuja, stated that the candidate of the party would be determined by the national convention.\n\nHowever, Bala Mohammed has continued to maintain that all the four aspirants in the consensus talks approached Babangida in one accord and requested him to choose a consensus presidential candidate from among them.\n\nSunday Sun gathered that the controversy trailing the outcome of the Northern consensus, notwithstanding, some party leaders believe that the number of presidential aspirants are too many. And thus would want to see a pruning down of the number.\n\nHowever, one of the party leaders said that the idea of consensus either at the national or regional level \u201ccan only work when aspirants are willing to accept the outcome. But you know that is not going to be possible.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the minority leader, House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, wants the aspirants to be united ahead of the convention.\n\nElumelu during a meeting between the House caucus and Hayatu-Deen, said that Nigerians were waiting for the PDP to rescue the country in 2023.\n\n\u201c\u2026that brings me to the issue you were championing \u2013 consensus. That brings me to the issue of the unity that all of you went round, crisscrossing this nation, seeking understanding amongst yourselves, the aspiration to lead this nation.\n\n\u201cI want to plead that you will continue in that strive. Nigerians are waiting for us, they\u2019re calling on us to come and rescue or rebuild Nigeria. Well, we can only do that If we also put ourselves in a position that Nigerians hope to see us, to rescue them and bring them back to where our founding fathers had wished that we should be.\u201d\n\nHowever, in spite of heightening tension in the party over the zoning controversy and the likely implication of the pending suit in court, the PDP spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, said that there is no cause for alarm.\n\nOlogunagba told Sunday Sun that \u201c the PDP is a party of rules and order. Be rest assured that we are going to follow our constitution and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say that the outcome of the presidential primary, as well as the way and manner the PDP candidate emerges will mark the beginning of the success or failure of the opposition party in next year\u2019s poll.",

          "text": "\n\n*PDP panics, makes accusations without evidence\n\n*CBN gov has not broken any law, northern coalitions insist, tackle Akeredolu\n\n*Coalition picks APC nomination forms for AfDB president, Adesina\n\n\n\nFestus Akanbi, Ejiofor Alike in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said he would decide in the next few days on the pressure being mounted on him to contest the 2023 presidential race.\n\n\n\nThe apex bank governor has also rejected the presidential nomination and Expression of Interest (EoI) forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC) procured for him by some farmers across the country. Emefiele who acknowledged the enormous pressure being mounted on him to throw his hat into the 2023 presidential ring, further clarified that he would make up his mind on the issue in the next few days.\n\n\n\nEmefiele\u2019s decision to decide in a few days has created panic in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the main opposition party yesterday made unfounded allegations against the apex bank\u2019s governor.\n\nAs the deadline for the purchase of the APC presidential forms expires on Tuesday, May 10, former President Goodluck Jonathan has also come under last-minute pressure to throw his hat into the presidential ring on the platform of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and former Minister of Agriculture, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, has however collected his nomination and EoI forms to vie for the APC presidential ticket.\n\nThis is coming as a Coalition of North-Central Youths Vanguard for Emefiele has said that the apex bank governor has not broken any law.\n\n\n\nThe Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum (UNNYF), one of the groups calling on Emefiele to contest for the 2023 Presidency, has also condemned the call by the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, for Emefiele to resign.\n\nThe group reminded the Ondo State governor that \u201cthere is no provision in the Nigerian Constitution stopping Emefiele from seeking election into the office of the president while in office, provided he has not been disqualified by Section 137.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn rejecting the forms procured for him by farmers, Emefiele said that should he decide to join the presidential race, he would use his hard-earned savings from his banking career to purchase the forms.\n\nThe CBN governor, in a series of Tweets, disclosed that he hasn\u2019t decided on whether to throw his hat into the ring or not.\n\nHe also revealed that he prefers to pay for his forms from the proceeds of his savings whenever he makes up his mind.\n\nThe Twitter message read: \u201cI am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the Office of President in the 2023 general election: I have not come to that decision. I note and salute the sacrifices of those farmers and patriots going as far as raising personal funds and offering me presidential nomination forms: I thank them most profusely.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, should I answer their calls and decide to seek presidential nomination, I will use my own hard-earned savings from over 35 years of banking leadership to buy my nomination forms, without proxies in an open and transparent manner in full compliance with the laws and Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd should I not run for elected office, I will continue to serve and sacrifice for the good people of Nigeria under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is a serious decision that requires God\u2019s Divine intervention: In the next few days The Almighty will so direct.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmefiele\u2019s pronouncement has already created panic in PDP even when he has not decided to contest. National Publicity Secretary of the of the party, Mr. Debo Ologunagba told journalists in Abuja yesterday that the decision of the CBN governor to contest will bring untold hardship and crippling effect on the already fragile economy and loss of confidence on the economy by international investors.\n\n\n\nA coalition of rice farmers and other crop growers had on Friday moved to drag the governor of the apex bank into the 2023 presidential race by purchasing the N100 million APC\u2019s Presidential EoI and Nomination forms for him. Expressing the reason for their push for Emefiele, the farmers said the CBN governor as the head of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, \u201chas shown capacity, focus, courage and worked tirelessly with the economic team of President Muhammadu Buhari to keep the economy of our great country afloat above recession and outright collapse.\u201d\n\n\n\nReacting to the controversy trailing the purchase of the APC forms for Emefiele by the farmers, a Coalition of North-Central Youths Vanguard for Emefiele yesterday declared that the CBN governor has not broken any law.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Coalition, Ameenah Hayatudeen, said the group was aware of the provisions of Section 9 of the CBN Act, which states that: \u201cthe Governor and the Deputy Governor shall devote the whole of their time to the service of the Bank and while holding office shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation whether remunerated or not except such personal and charitable causes as may be determined by the Board and which do not conflict with or detract from their full-time duties\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nIt noted that based on the above provision, the CBN Governor or Deputy Governor cannot be involved in any other employment or vocation while in office.\n\nIt stated: \u201cArising from this, therefore, how do we define employment or vocation? In the case of Shell Petroleum Company of Nigeria vs Federal Board of Inland Revenue 1996 8 NWLR Part 466 256, the Supreme Court held that where the words of a statute are plain, precise and unambiguous, then it should be given the ordinary and natural meaning,\u201d the group explained.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe make bold to ask then from Emefiele\u2019s traducers what then is the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018employment\u2019? And what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the word \u2018vocation\u2019?\u201d the group queried.\n\nThe group explained that employment means \u2018the state of having paid work,\u2019 while \u2018vocation means a person\u2019s employment or main occupation\u2019. It added: \u201cBased on these definitions above, can it then be said that seeking election into the office of the president of Nigeria is an employment or vocation? The answer must surely be negative. Anything other than that will be the most artificial interpretation to suit a sinister purpose.\n\nThe group argued that contesting for the position of the president is an exercise of constitutional rights and not an engagement in any employment or vocation.\n\nOn its part, UNNYF, one of the groups calling on Emefiele to contest has condemned Akeredolu\u2019s call for him to resign.\n\n\n\nUNNYF in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna accused the governor and \u201csponsored people\u201d of trying to undermine the credibility of the CBN governor \u201cwho has yet to yield to numerous calls to contest for the presidency.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by the Convener of the group, Mohammed Danlami, maintained that \u201cthere is no provision in the Nigerian Constitution stopping Emefiele from seeking election into the office of the president while in office, provided he has not been disqualified by Section 137.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are particularly disappointed with the position of Governor Akeredolu who should know better than power must rotate among all regions of Nigeria for equity, fairness and equal opportunities.\n\nAccording to the group, since 23 years of the current democratic dispensation, the South-west with just six states had produced the president for eight years, a vice president for eight years and two speakers of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nThe group challenged the Ondo State governor to approach a competent court to challenge the CBN governor if he feels bothered about his candidacy.\n\nIt said the calls for Emefiele to resign stemmed from the deliberate misinterpretation of Section 9 of the CBN Act.\n\nThe group called on others who had called for the resignation of the CBN governor to tell their sponsors that such a call was dead on arrival.\n\nEthnic Youth Leaders Fault Sagay over Emefiele\n\n\n\nIn a related development, a group of ethnic youth leaders in Nigeria has condemned the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Prof. Itse Sagay, for opposing the calls on Emefiele to contest the presidency.\n\nThe group under the aegis of the Nigerian Ethnic Youths Leaders Council (NEYLC) wondered why a senior lawyer, \u201cwill throw caution into the wind and begin to make public statements that are capable of undermining the political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe NEYLC is made up of the Arewa Consultative Youths Movement (ACYM), Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youths.\n\nThe group\u2019s position was contained in a statement by the Ohanaeze youths\u2019 Secretary-General and Head of the coalition\u2019s secretariat, Nwada Ike Chiamaka.\n\n\u201cTalking magisterially on a decision that can only be taken by party delegates (which he is not among) only portrays Prof. Sagay as a meddlesome interloper in this matter,\u201d the groups said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of 28 groups consisting of Youth Arise Movement, Nigerians in Diaspora One Nigeria Group, Prudent Youth Association of Nigeria, women groups, farmers, people with disabilities and other civil society groups, has raised the N100 million fee to purchase the APC forms for the former minister, Adesina. The coalition is led by the Head, of One Nigeria Group, Mr Mohammed Saleh.\n\nJonathan under Last-minute Pressure to Declare for 2023 Presidency\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as the deadline for the purchase of the APC\u2019s presidential forms expires on Tuesday, May 10, former President Goodluck Jonathan has come under last-minute pressure to throw his hat into the presidential ring on the platform of the ruling party. Investigation however revealed that Jonathan has delayed his decision due to the clamour by the South-east to produce the next president and the large number of aspirants in the APC.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that some northern leaders, including emirs and APC chieftains from the region, intensified pressure on the former president following his recent public pronouncement that he was considering the call by his supporters to contest the next presidential election.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some of these APC chieftains also sent emissaries to him in Rivers State yesterday where he attended the burial ceremony of one of the policemen in his security team.\n\nThe policeman, who died after a protracted illness, was said to have been with the former president since his days as the deputy governor of Bayelsa State.\n\n\n\nA source close to Jonathan told THISDAY last night that the former president has not made up his mind because of the large number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC and the agitation by the South-east to produce the next president.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is under intense pressure by some northern leaders and emirs who have insisted that he is the only one that can stabilise the country at this point. But two issues are delaying his decision. One, he is not comfortable with the large number of people that have purchased the presidential forms in APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe believes that a large number of aspirants will make it difficult for the party to reach a consensus and he doesn\u2019t want to come out and be ridiculed. He wants to be the consensus candidate. Again, he is concerned about the popular demand for South-east presidency. He doesn\u2019t want to contest against the South-east because of the massive support the region gave him in his previous aspirations.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe believes that even if he emerges as the consensus candidate of APC, it will be morally wrong for him to contest against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate if the party\u2019s candidate emerges from the South-east,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nThe source also revealed that the extension of the sale of forms to May 10 (Tuesday) by the ruling party was part of the strategy to give Jonathan more time to conclude consultations and make up his mind.\n\nThose rooting for Jonathan want the power to return to the North after four years because he has only one term to complete the maximum two tenures of four years each.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nBarring any last-minute change of schedules, the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will on Wednesday meet to decide on the report of its 37-man committee headed by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State.\n\nThe committee had recommended that the party should throw open the presidential ticket of the party to all interested party members.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as an elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai has urged the main opposition party to adhere to the principle of zoning and zone its presidential ticket to the South-east for the sake of equity and stability.\n\nDespite the clamour for a power shift to the South, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim and the Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal yesterday intensified consultations on their presidential ambition, lamenting that the current administration led by APC has shattered the hopes of Nigerians.\n\n\n\nThis is just as the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, urged the ruling party to fix the universities and end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) with the huge funds generated from the sale of its presidential nomination forms.\n\n\n\nThe PDP NEC had in its meeting set up a 37-man committee to discuss and advise the party on where to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBefore the submission of the report to NEC, the report, which recommended that all the geo-political zones should be allowed to run, was leaked to the media.\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Chairman of the committee, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu submitted the committee\u2019s report on behalf of Ortom.\n\nIn their separate comments, the National Chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu and Elumelu had stated that only the NEC of the party would have the final say on the vexed issue of zoning after debating the outcome of the committee\u2019s report.\n\n\n\nAyu promised that the committee\u2019s recommendations would be transmitted to the NEC, which would take a final decision.\n\nAccording to him, the decision would be made known to \u201cparty members across the country and all Nigerians who are eagerly awaiting the final decision of your committee.\u201d\n\n\n\nSources close to the 37-man committee had stated that the party\u2019s leadership was more interested in how to win the presidential election than zoning of the presidency which might hamper their effort to regain power in 2023.\n\nHowever, the governors of the party from the South rose from their meeting in April, insisting that the presidential ticket of the party must be zoned to the South.\n\n\n\nThe NEC meeting after suffering several adjustments is expected to hold on Wednesday to bring the issue to rest. This was confirmed by the National Secretary of PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu.\n\nHe said that the earlier shift was due to the local government delegate election.\n\nZone Presidential Ticket to South-east for Stability, Equity, Yakassai tells PDP\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the 97-year-old Yakassai has urged the PDP to zone its presidential ticket to the South for the sake of stability and justice.\n\nHe also that the APC has no reason not to zone its presidential ticket to the South as the Presidency of Muhammadu Buhari comes to an end by 2023 having been elected in 2015.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe presidential ticket of the APC is expected to rotate between North and South.\u201d\n\nTanko Yakassai said: \u201cThough the timing is not ripe now as the PDP could have decided the zoning of its presidential ticket at least six months before now, for equity and stability of the country, the PDP should zone its presidential ticket to the zone that has not produced it since the return to democracy after several years of military rule.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy advice to the PDP as the party meets on Wednesday to discuss where the presidential ticket of the party will come from, I think that much as the timing is late, the party should listen to the voice of reason and give the South-east that opportunity. This will help reduce the tension in the country and help stabilise the country. We are in real danger over this agitation to shift power to the South,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\nHe described the support of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) for the North to retain power as a harbinger of crisis, insisting that it is not the fault of anybody that the north presented an incompetent person for the presidency in 2015.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom 2015 to 2023, the presidency of the country would have stayed in the North and therefore for equity and stability power should shift to the south and in fact to the geopolitical zone that have not have it since the return of democracy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Yakassai, \u201cthe APC is duty-bound to ensure that power shifts to the South.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the PDP, it is not the party in power, but for the stability and giving a sense of belonging, I would support that it is zoned to the South and in the South-east in particular. This will help to heal the wounds of the nation as was the case in 1999 went the country was bleeding as the result of the June 12 agitation\u201d\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, Anyim Intensify Consultations, Say Apc as Shattered\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku has lamented that Nigeria has never been this divided before, and vowed to restore the unity of Nigeria if voted to power in 2023.\n\nThe former vice president stated this when he met with delegates of the PDP in Ogun State at the party secretariat in Abeokuta, the state capital.\n\n\n\nAtiku noted that Nigeria must be rescued from the APC-led administration which he said has led the country into failure, following poor economy, insecurity and ethnic clashes.\n\nHe, however, promised not to fail Nigerians, saying APC has not been fair to all parts of this country.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise to unify this country. I promise to give a sense of belonging to every part of this country. We have done it before in 1999 when we came, there was a lot of disunities, but it was not as bad as this,\u201d Atiku explained.\n\nTambuwal and Anyim also took their consultations to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party and Kogi State, respectively.\n\n\n\nTambuwal told the PDP NWC that if allowed to become the presidential candidate in the 2023 presidential election he will rescue Nigeria from becoming a failed state.\n\nIn the same manner, Anyim told the Kogi State delegates that if given the opportunity that he will revive the Ajaokuta Steel Mill to make the economy rebound.\n\n\n\nAccording to Tambuwal, who met the PDP NWC to present his manifesto, \u201cwe are all in agreement; that is what I can call consensus, that we are facing greater dangers that we\u2019ve never faced before. Our country has been divided as never before. Our economy is in shambles. The security ravaging the country has never been this bad.\n\nThe general summation of the situation of the country is that we are inching towards a failed state. I\u2019m not saying that Nigeria is already a failed state, but we\u2019re inching towards that.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Anyim pledged to restore the economy and improve the security situation in the country if he emerges the president in 2023.\n\n\n\nHe also unveiled his agenda to revitalise the economy and revive the moribund Ajaokuta Steel Company which is almost over 90 per cent near completion\n\nAnyim said that apart from reviving the Ajaokuta Steel Company that he will also provide purposeful political leadership that will move the country forward.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy pedigree as a former Senate President and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation has positioned and given me the political capacity to move the country forward,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his response on behalf of the party\u2019s NWC, the National Chairman of the PDP, Ayu, promised a transparent and fair presidential primary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We were never hungry even when every country in the world shut its borders for nearly a year.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly God knows what would have happened if we were importing the food we eat. There would have been war. But that was averted due to the resilience of Nigerian farmers and commitment to agriculture by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.\u201d\n\n\n\nA leader from the South-east, Chief Madu Ndubuisi, said the representatives of farmers and their leaders decided to acquire an APC form for Emefiele, who is the driver of the Buhari agricultural revolution, to sustain this unprecedented agricultural feat.\n\n\n\n22 APC Presidential Aspirants Pick Forms\n\nAs at last night, no fewer than 22 presidential aspirants had purchased the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms of the APC ahead of Tuesday\u2019s deadline.\n\nThe new aspirants that picked forms are Emefiele; former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; the Senator representing Ondo-North, Ajayi Boroffice and the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu.\n\n\n\nOthers that had earlier picked forms are Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi; former Imo State governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Minister of State, Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba; former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu and Uju Kennedy, the only female aspirant.\n\n\n\nThe APC has also sold forms to Pastor Tunde Bakare; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the youngest presidential aspirant, Nicholas Bello; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; former Senate President, Ken Nnamani and Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige.\n\n\n\nOthers are Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru; the former Governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima and the former speaker, House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole.\n\n\n\nYerima, Onu Join Race to Succeed Buhari\n\nYerima joined the presidential race yesterday, declaring that he had informed President Buhari of his ambition.\n\nYerima, who spoke after meeting with the President at the State House, Abuja, said he was seeking the presidential ticket of APC with the aim of improving on the efforts of the Buhari administration.\n\n\n\nOn his plans to set things straight for Nigeria, Yerima said he would be focusing on three critical areas of needs namely insecurity, poverty and ignorance.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovations, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, yesterday officially declared his intention to vie for the APC\u2019s presidential ticket ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\n\n\n\nSouth-west presidential aspirants meet in Lagos\n\nSouth-west APC presidential aspirants and leaders met in Lagos yesterday and reached an agreement to ensure that the region produces the next APC presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nA former National Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande, made this known while addressing journalists at the end of the meeting.\n\n\n\nHe said the South-west APC presidential aspirants, governors and other leaders are united ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\nThe party stalwarts and aspirants also agreed \u201cto talk to themselves and the public with absolute decorum.\u201d\n\nAkande said: \u201cWe are united as we will ensure that the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will come to the South-west.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had a fruitful discussion.

          "text": "\n\n*Declares only Rivers entitled to 13% derivation from the wells\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday resolved the issue of the state entitled to the revenues from 17 oil wells in Akri and Mbede communities in favour of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nBoth Rivers and Imo states have been engaged in legal battles over the ownership of the 17 oil wells located in boundary communities between the two states.\n\n\n\nThe National Boundary Commission had in the Nigeria Administrative Map, 10th, 11th, 12th, and other maps delineated the two communities in which the 17 oil wells are located in Imo State.\n\n\n\nBut, Rivers State, citing decree No. 14 of 1967, Decree No. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military Government on the Irikefe and the Nasir Boundary Commission/Boundary Adjustment Commission, amongst others, claimed ownership of the disputed communities and urged the court to declare same.\n\n\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit that had the Attorney General of the Federation and Imo State as 1st and 2nd defendants respectively, the apex court held that from the evidence before it, the affected oil wells fell in the area belonging to Rivers.\n\n\n\nIn the summary judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, which was prepared by Justice Helen Ogunwunmiju, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s case succeed in part\u201d and went ahead to declare that \u201cit is only Rivers State that is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue derived from the oil wells on the basis of the 13% derivation principle as provided for under Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, among others.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court based its decision on the fact that the boundary between Rivers and Imo states, as delineated in Nigeria Administrative Map 10th, 11th, 12th, editions and other maps bearing similar delineation was inaccurate, incorrect, and did not represent the legitimate and lawful boundaries between Rivers and Imo states.\n\n\n\nThe apex court had earlier declared that the correct instruments, map and documents to be relied upon in determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo states were those used by Rivers State in delineating the boundary line between the two states, including Decree No. 14 of 1967, Decree No. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military Government on the Irikefe and the Nasir Boundary Commission/Boundary Adjustment Commission, the Eastern Nigeria Map, the Provincial Map of Owerri Province, Warri Province, Onitsha Province, Rivers Province, the Ahoada District Map and Aboh Division Map.\n\n\n\nThe apex Court also declared that based on the correct instruments, maps and documents for determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo states, the following Rivers State communities wrongly attributed to Imo State, among other communities, are communities within the territorial boundaries of Rivers State and therefore communities in respect of which Rivers State was entitled to exercise governmental and administrative powers, including entitlement to benefits derivable from mineral or other resources within the communities.\n\n\n\nOther reliefs sought by Rivers State, which were granted by the unanimous judgment include: \u201cA declaration that all the oil wells within Akri and Mbede communities, usually identified with the names Akri and Mbede, including the oil wells identified on Rivers State Map showing the location of oil wells wrongly attributed to Imo State, including Akri 012, Akri 009, Akri 010, Akri 004, Akri West 002, Akri 001, Akri West 001, Akri 003, Akri 002, and Akri South 001, Mbede 017, Mbede 010, Mbede 019, Mbede 018, Mbede 002, Mbede 009, and Mbede 005 are all oil wells within the territory of Rivers State and form part of Rivers State and that it is only Rivers State that is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue derived from the oil wells on the basis of the 13% derivation principle as provided for under Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, among others.\n\n\n\n\u201cA declaration that the Plaintiffs\u2019 Map No. 2020/0303 \u2014 LD of 22/12/2020 showing the boundary line between the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant represents the correct boundary between the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant.\n\n\u201cAn Order of Injunction directing the 1st Defendant to withdraw from circulation its Administrative Map 10th Edition, 11th Edition and 12th Edition and to refrain from relying on any of the said Maps for the purpose of determining the boundary between the Plaintiff and the 2nd defendant.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe apex court, however, refused to make an order of Mandatory Injunction directing the AGF \u201cto calculate, to the satisfaction of the Plaintiff, and refund to the Plaintiff all revenue that have been wrongly denied the Plaintiff and wrongly attributed to or paid to Imo State on account of the limit or extent of their territories, including earnings due to the Plaintiff from distributable, revenue derived from the Akri and Mbede oil wells.\u201d\n\nThe court also refused to order the defendant to pay the Plaintiff the sum of N500 million as costs for the prosecution of the Plaintiff\u2019s suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

You should create a political wing among yourself so that it will further gear your participation in politics, it will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for us to act toward our prayers, the emergence of a good leader but we need to partake in political activities.

          "text": "The founder of the House On The Rock Church, Pastor Paul Adefarasin, Sunday, revealed the plans by some Christian leaders to influence the choice of presidential candidate their church members should vote for.\n\nAdefarasin made this revelation during his preaching on Sunday.\n\nThe cleric also called on Christians to get their Permanent Voter Card (PVC) to vote for candidates endorsed by church leaders to influence the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe further told his congregants that instructions regarding which political candidates to vote for would be provided.\n\n\u201cWhen we get closer, we will share the profile of the candidate that you should vote for and the ones who tick the most boxes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose are the ones you should vote for. It is imperative that every believer; online and offline, you must get your PVC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man under authority; once used to be the Deputy President of the PFN (Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria) and did not want to go further in that structure, in that executive office, so I can have more time to pastor this church and other things I feel like God is telling me to do. I\u2019m still on the National Advisory Council and we have been instructed that every Christian, every human being you can contact must have a PVC and must prepare to vote.\n\n\u201cWhen we get closer, we will share the profile of the candidate that you should vote for and the ones who tick the most boxes, those are the ones you should vote for.\n\n\u201cWe believe, we can get 15 million more voters and that becomes a very significant bloc that must be respected and it adds to the platform of our voice, harmonised as Christian leaders.\n\n\u201cOne thing that the next president absolutely must be is a respecter of the law.\u201d\n\nRecently, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) established a directorate to oversee political aspirants in the church and monitor their success.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is a member and pastor of the church.\n\nAlthough Osinbajo has not declared his interest in the 2023 presidential race, different groups have been soliciting the support of Nigerians for the vice-president.\n\nA few weeks after, a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu urged the Supreme Council for Shari\u2019ah in the country to also create the directorate of politics, which according to him is to create political awareness among the faithful towards producing a Muslim president in 2023.\n\nHe had said, \u201cOther religious groups have commenced political sensitisation by creating political departments or directorate among themselves to promote their own. You should create a political wing among yourself so that it will further gear your participation in politics, it will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for us to act toward our prayers, the emergence of a good leader but we need to partake in political activities. Almighty Allah answers our prayer through our actions so while praying let us act towards it.\n\n\u201cThrough the president of the Supreme Council for Shari\u2019ah in Nigeria, I will visit all states of this nation. I can\u2019t be opportune to see all Muslims in Nigeria but through the Muslim leaders, we can make it happen.\u201d",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Shooting \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019 at peak of COVID-19 scary, says Biyi Bandele",
          "text": "\u2018Blood Sisters\u2018, the much-awaited Netflix original, premiered exclusively on the streaming platform globally, on Thursday. The project, which is Nigeria\u2019s first series to be shown on Netflix, has continued to elicit different reactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiyi Bandele, director of the project, recently featured on TheCable\u2019s Twitter Space on the film titled \u201cBlood Sisters: Nollywood\u2019s New Gem\u201d.\n\nThe UK-based Nigerian writer and filmmaker spoke on various aspects of the movie as well as the criticism trailing it in some quarters.\n\nAre you tired of people associating you with \u2018Half of a Yellow Sun\u2019?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, I\u2019m very proud of that film. It was a miracle that it got made, and after it was made, all sorts of things tried to bury it. People attacked it until they saw it. But it\u2019s going to be around long after I\u2019m not here. I\u2019ve done other things since then but I\u2019m really proud of that film.\n\nHow did you get on the \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019 project?\n\nI was actually in New York, doing a fellowship at NYU in 2020, to research a book I\u2019m currently writing when I got a call from Mo Abudu. She produced \u2018Fifty\u2019, which I\u2019d done with her many years ago. She\u2019d phoned to find out if I\u2019d be interested in directing another film, not Blood Sisters. The film was so important that I said yes to her offer. It was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspended the research I was doing, suspended the writing of the book and I came home to work on the screenplay for that project. Then, while I was working on it, Netflix said they had to postpone it. So, I decided to stay home because I hadn\u2019t stayed in Nigeria for a very long time.\n\nWhile I was waiting, one Friday night, around 10 pm, Mo called me saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this project called Blood Sisters, and we\u2019re in pre-production, weeks away from shooting. We would like to offer you the project to direct. I need an answer from you tonight.\u2019 I asked her for a brief summary which she gave me, and I liked what she said. Then, I decided to read the script.\n\nThey\u2019d already cast. Usually, I\u2019d be involved in every aspect \u2013 writing the screenplay, casting \u2013 I\u2019d be involved in everything. Now, I could just go into this and test my skills as a filmmaker. It was an adventure. I just dived into it. I took a chance and it was really fun.\n\nIt was a star-studded cast! Did this make your work as a director harder?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, the most important thing is once I know I can get a performance out of an actor. Directing is a craft. It\u2019s no different from carpentry or bricklaying. You piece things together bit by bit. There are right ways of doing it and rubbish ways of doing it.\n\nThe joy of working on \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019, with someone like Ramsey or Nancy or Ini or Deyemi or Kate or Uche was that they were all great actors. They were actors that you could direct. You could say let\u2019s do this or that and they will do it even if they were not sure or didn\u2019t completely agree with you. But once they saw that it worked, they went all the way with it.\n\nI was in heaven, basically.\n\nHow were you able to get the emotions needed from the actors?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I\u2019m working with an actor on the story, I bring a combination of experiences that I\u2019ve had in life, my knowledge of movies and writing, and how to move an audience. Then, I apply that to what I\u2019m doing.\n\nIt involved a lot of conversations with my actors. Nancy and Ini were incredible. The way they worked together, there was no ego. They were not trying to outact each other\u2026 They were incredibly generous to each other. Sometimes, one of them would allow the other one to shine in a scene.\n\nWe were all working together as one. I had a great DP, crew, and producers. The right team came together at the right time.\n\nThe whole idea of filmmaking is storytelling. An integral aspect of which is the thematic component. Given the timing of this movie, what message does it hold for the Nigerian context?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message is one that is dear to me. I remember once, many years ago, a friend I grew up with was talking about his wife. They were getting divorced. And he told me a story, very casually, about beating her up. That was the last time I spoke to him.\n\nIn episode 1 of \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019, I wanted Kola to be created on his own terms. I didn\u2019t want the audience to think that this guy is an animal just yet until he does what he does. Because anyone who does that does not think of themselves as evil. I wanted him to just be himself and the audience would make up its mind. So, I was subtle but effectively building a case for the defense after the killing. It was important that I didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bad guy\u201d. That\u2019s easy to do.\n\nI hope people take from it messages that would enrich their lives. I\u2019m not a preacher. You tell stories to raise a mirror to society and say look at yourself. And sometimes that\u2019s more than enough. Sometimes seeing yourself in the mirror is a shock. And it makes you think.\n\nApart from domestic violence, we saw a dysfunctional family and the rot that stems from it. What do you think parents can learn from this?\n\nWe had a lot of conversations about how we were going to play the role of the scary matriarch. Her relationship with her favourite son, Kola, looks almost incestuous. The first time it happened, Kate and I had talked about it in detail but I hadn\u2019t told Deyemi, the person playing Kola. And he was so startled. But I wanted to create this portrait of this family as so dysfunctional that everything that goes wrong with it is almost inevitable.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not a preacher. I don\u2019t have answers to anything. For me, the important thing is that I create a very clear and plausible picture and the audience will take from it what it will. We do have an epidemic of violence, and a lot of that starts from home.\n\nWe have this habit of blaming everything on our leaders as if our leaders come from Mars. Our leaders are us\u2026 We create them. We behave exactly the way our leaders do. It\u2019s to basically have these conversations with ourselves about how we interact with each other. That, for me, is what we tried to do in Blood Sisters.\n\nNollywood has received a lot of criticism about directing, scripting, casting, and even pictures. What do you think Blood Sisters did right that subsequent titles can emulate?\n\nI can only speak for myself as a filmmaker. I believe very much in craft, and in learning your craft. I\u2019ve been doing this all my life. I learnt my craft really well.\n\nI have no desire to be a director of photography (DP) but I know how to work with DPs. I have no desire to be a costume designer but I work with them. The most important thing is knowing how to work with different aspects of your film crew, and knowing the right questions to ask them.\n\nWhen you watch a film in Nigeria, you know if the director knows what they\u2019re doing. There are a lot of people in the Nigerian film industry who are very powerful but haven\u2019t spent the time to learn their craft. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nWhat influenced your choice of casting?\n\nI was not a part of that. It was Mo and a group of other people. The only character I was involved in casting was Gabriel\u2019s character. Gabriel was originally meant to play the journalist but the person meant to play the character Gabriel I ended up playing pulled out for personal reasons. I thought Gabriel would be great for the role and Mo agreed with me. So, we made a strong case with Netflix and they gave the go-ahead.\n\nHowever, I molded the characters. For instance, Ramsey\u2019s character had dialogue in the original script. But I thought it would be much more powerful if we threw the dialogue out. I sat down with Ramsey and had a long conversation. He didn\u2019t agree with me at first, but we did a couple of scenes and he looked at me and nodded. He didn\u2019t say anything but I knew what that nod meant.\n\nThe casting was great already. The cast is a very important tool when you\u2019re making a film.\n\nIni is an incredible actress. She\u2019s a method actor. The first time I met her when we had to read the script, I thought she was just trying too much. I was like, relax, take it easy. Later on, I realised she was just in character. The person I met was not Ini, it was the character she was playing.\n\nWhat influenced the choice to go with Genoveva Umeh for the role of Timeyin?\n\nOf all the characters in the film, her role was the one that worried me the most. I was not sure how I was going to work with whoever played that character. I wanted the character to be first outrageous but not so outrageous.\n\nI wanted the audience to think, \u2018I could run into this person in real life\u2019, not just a character from a film. I actually gave Geneveve a couple of films to watch. She found them and she watched them.\n\nWe talked just so we could have the same reference. So, we used those films as a reference point. She\u2019s a very talented actress.\n\nHow long did it take to put the whole project together?\n\nBecause we were shooting volumes 1 and 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously. It was the same crew and the same actors. There were days when I would wait for Keneth to shoot and I had to use the same crew and actors. Or the other way round.\n\nIt was very intense. It was many weeks. I really honestly don\u2019t remember.\n\nDid everything run smoothly on set all the time?\n\nThe thing about making a film is that if you\u2019re not really passionate about what you\u2019re doing, then there will be\u2026. As a director, sometimes, you want to do so many things, and you need tools to achieve this. And you hear that producer say they don\u2019t have the money. Sometimes, it becomes scary. That happens on every set.\n\nKudos to my first assistant director who was able to put everyone under control. We shot during the height of COVID-19 and Netflix insisted that we\u2019re tested often. It was random. I was scared that I might test positive, because I knew that if I did, then everything would stop.\n\nSometimes, you\u2019ll get to a location and you\u2019ll be told that an actor in a scene has gone into isolation. So, it was pretty intense, it was not an easy shoot. When we did the last shoot, it felt like a relief.\n\nDo you not think the excessive sex scenes can overshadow the main theme?\n\nThere is nothing aggravated in the film. Not the violence, not the sex, it\u2019s just film. For me, pretty much every movie that I have made, and every TV series that I worked on were made for adult audiences. I don\u2019t make movies for people under 12 or 13. I will someday but I haven\u2019t yet. And I\u2019ll do anything if I know that the story legitimately requires it.\n\nI think there\u2019s a level of laughable hypocrisy when you come from a country like Nigeria, which has about 200 million people. Why would you then censor the portrayal of sex on screen? It is pure hypocrisy.\n\nWhen the story requires it, when it calls for it, you find a way of making it happen. And the truth about sex on screen is that it\u2019s one of the most. I think on Netflix the show is for people over 16.\n\nWhat was your fondest moment on set?\n\nThere were so many. There was a scene with the wild dogs. Initially, when we were casting those, photos of the dogs were sent to me, and I said they look like Ajebutter dogs, not wild. On the night when some wild dogs were brought to the set, they wanted to eat up a cow who was in a field near the set.\n\nAnd the dogs\u2019 handler had to restrain them. They treated him like he was one of them and he behaved like he was also.\n\nSo, when it came to directing the scenes, I could not direct the dogs. We did all sorts of stuff, we just sat and waited, and eventually, they started doing what we wanted them to do of their own volition. And we enjoyed watching it. It was a joy watching that.\n\nOutside of that, it was just working with great actors, some of them are not stars. They were fantastic. When I\u2019m working with actors and I get performances out of them, it gives me a lot of joy. So, every moment on set was a joy.\n\nWorking with Kate Henshaw, Deyemi was a great joy. Every scene was tough to achieve but as we did, it was great. Wale Ojo and Segun Arinze were also incredible.\n\nAre there plans for a sequel?\n\nI have no idea. Right now, I\u2019m writing a book. A lot of the chapters are set in Lagos at the marina on Broad street between 1852 and 1890. The character is Samuel Ajayi Crowther.\n\nWas it informed by something that happened?\n\nThe idea actually came from Temidayo, Mo Abudu\u2019s daughter. But I wasn\u2019t part of that. I was given the script and what I did with it was work with my actors on the dialogues. We adapted everything. It was important for me that my characters speak in a way people of that class speak in Lagos.\n\nI don\u2019t know where that idea came to Temidayo.\n\nHow has the collaboration between Netflix and Nollywood improved the Nigerian film industry?\n\nI can say that in terms of quality, Netflix has influenced Nollywood. The budget has been better, I think that\u2019s a key element.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2018Blood Sisters\u2018, the much-awaited Netflix original, premiered exclusively on the streaming platform globally, on Thursday. The project, which is Nigeria\u2019s first series to be shown on Netflix, has continued to elicit different reactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiyi Bandele, director of the project, recently featured on TheCable\u2019s Twitter Space on the film titled \u201cBlood Sisters: Nollywood\u2019s New Gem\u201d.\n\nThe UK-based Nigerian writer and filmmaker spoke on various aspects of the movie as well as the criticism trailing it in some quarters.\n\nAre you tired of people associating you with \u2018Half of a Yellow Sun\u2019?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, I\u2019m very proud of that film. It was a miracle that it got made, and after it was made, all sorts of things tried to bury it. People attacked it until they saw it. But it\u2019s going to be around long after I\u2019m not here. I\u2019ve done other things since then but I\u2019m really proud of that film.\n\nHow did you get on the \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019 project?\n\nI was actually in New York, doing a fellowship at NYU in 2020, to research a book I\u2019m currently writing when I got a call from Mo Abudu. She produced \u2018Fifty\u2019, which I\u2019d done with her many years ago. She\u2019d phoned to find out if I\u2019d be interested in directing another film, not Blood Sisters. The film was so important that I said yes to her offer. It was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspended the research I was doing, suspended the writing of the book and I came home to work on the screenplay for that project. Then, while I was working on it, Netflix said they had to postpone it. So, I decided to stay home because I hadn\u2019t stayed in Nigeria for a very long time.\n\nWhile I was waiting, one Friday night, around 10 pm, Mo called me saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this project called Blood Sisters, and we\u2019re in pre-production, weeks away from shooting. We would like to offer you the project to direct. I need an answer from you tonight.\u2019 I asked her for a brief summary which she gave me, and I liked what she said. Then, I decided to read the script.\n\nThey\u2019d already cast. Usually, I\u2019d be involved in every aspect \u2013 writing the screenplay, casting \u2013 I\u2019d be involved in everything. Now, I could just go into this and test my skills as a filmmaker. It was an adventure. I just dived into it. I took a chance and it was really fun.\n\nIt was a star-studded cast! Did this make your work as a director harder?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, the most important thing is once I know I can get a performance out of an actor. Directing is a craft. It\u2019s no different from carpentry or bricklaying. You piece things together bit by bit. There are right ways of doing it and rubbish ways of doing it.\n\nThe joy of working on \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019, with someone like Ramsey or Nancy or Ini or Deyemi or Kate or Uche was that they were all great actors. They were actors that you could direct. You could say let\u2019s do this or that and they will do it even if they were not sure or didn\u2019t completely agree with you. But once they saw that it worked, they went all the way with it.\n\nI was in heaven, basically.\n\nHow were you able to get the emotions needed from the actors?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I\u2019m working with an actor on the story, I bring a combination of experiences that I\u2019ve had in life, my knowledge of movies and writing, and how to move an audience. Then, I apply that to what I\u2019m doing.\n\nIt involved a lot of conversations with my actors. Nancy and Ini were incredible. The way they worked together, there was no ego. They were not trying to outact each other\u2026 They were incredibly generous to each other. Sometimes, one of them would allow the other one to shine in a scene.\n\nWe were all working together as one. I had a great DP, crew, and producers. The right team came together at the right time.\n\nThe whole idea of filmmaking is storytelling. An integral aspect of which is the thematic component. Given the timing of this movie, what message does it hold for the Nigerian context?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message is one that is dear to me. I remember once, many years ago, a friend I grew up with was talking about his wife. They were getting divorced. And he told me a story, very casually, about beating her up. That was the last time I spoke to him.\n\nIn episode 1 of \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019, I wanted Kola to be created on his own terms. I didn\u2019t want the audience to think that this guy is an animal just yet until he does what he does. Because anyone who does that does not think of themselves as evil. I wanted him to just be himself and the audience would make up its mind. So, I was subtle but effectively building a case for the defense after the killing. It was important that I didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bad guy\u201d. That\u2019s easy to do.\n\nI hope people take from it messages that would enrich their lives. I\u2019m not a preacher. You tell stories to raise a mirror to society and say look at yourself. And sometimes that\u2019s more than enough. Sometimes seeing yourself in the mirror is a shock. And it makes you think.\n\nApart from domestic violence, we saw a dysfunctional family and the rot that stems from it. What do you think parents can learn from this?\n\nWe had a lot of conversations about how we were going to play the role of the scary matriarch. Her relationship with her favourite son, Kola, looks almost incestuous. The first time it happened, Kate and I had talked about it in detail but I hadn\u2019t told Deyemi, the person playing Kola. And he was so startled. But I wanted to create this portrait of this family as so dysfunctional that everything that goes wrong with it is almost inevitable.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not a preacher. I don\u2019t have answers to anything. For me, the important thing is that I create a very clear and plausible picture and the audience will take from it what it will. We do have an epidemic of violence, and a lot of that starts from home.\n\nWe have this habit of blaming everything on our leaders as if our leaders come from Mars. Our leaders are us\u2026 We create them. We behave exactly the way our leaders do. It\u2019s to basically have these conversations with ourselves about how we interact with each other. That, for me, is what we tried to do in Blood Sisters.\n\nNollywood has received a lot of criticism about directing, scripting, casting, and even pictures. What do you think Blood Sisters did right that subsequent titles can emulate?\n\nI can only speak for myself as a filmmaker. I believe very much in craft, and in learning your craft. I\u2019ve been doing this all my life. I learnt my craft really well.\n\nI have no desire to be a director of photography (DP) but I know how to work with DPs. I have no desire to be a costume designer but I work with them. The most important thing is knowing how to work with different aspects of your film crew, and knowing the right questions to ask them.\n\nWhen you watch a film in Nigeria, you know if the director knows what they\u2019re doing. There are a lot of people in the Nigerian film industry who are very powerful but haven\u2019t spent the time to learn their craft. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nWhat influenced your choice of casting?\n\nI was not a part of that. It was Mo and a group of other people.

It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.\n\nThe infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population.\n\nAccording to a statement by the UK health security agency, \u201cthe patient has a recent travel history from Nigeria, which is where they are believed to have contracted the infection, before travelling to the UK\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency said the patient is receiving care at the expert infectious disease unit at the Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, London.\n\n\u201cAs a precautionary measure, UKHSA experts are working closely with NHS colleagues and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThis includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly. If passengers are not contacted then there is no action they should take.\u201d\n\nThe first-ever recorded occurrence of the virus in the UK was in two persons in 2018, who had also recently returned from Nigeria. Since then, five more cases have been confirmed in UK.\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), a total of 13 suspected cases has been reported between January 1 to February 28, 2022.\n\nOf the suspected cases, four were confirmed from four states \u2014 FCT (1), Imo (1), Adamawa (1) and Lagos (1) \u2014 but no death has been recorded.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anambra State Governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year tenure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Agbata will be expected to use his experience to help the government achieve its plans of building a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and supporting technology startups in the state.\n\nAgbata brings over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in different roles in the media and startup space, experience that he believes will serve him as he begins a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgbata\u2019s mandate will tie neatly into the state government\u2019s mission to make Anambra the digital and creative capital of Nigeria. Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "As Nigeria groans under a heavy debt burden of about N40 trillion, many citizens watch with mouth agape as top government officials in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration rush to pick N100million Presidential nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe latest national debt profile of Nigeria as seen on the website of the Debt Management Office (DMO) shows that Nigeria\u2019s total public debt has risen to N39.55 trillion as at December 2021.\n\nThis represents a N1.55 trillion or 4.1percent increase in three months when compared to the N38 trillion total public debt that was recorded as at September 2021.\n\nThat politicians could afford to pick a form at N40million and N100million amid the excruciating suffering in society has continued to generate conversation in the polity.\n\nObservers say it is a paradox- \u201cA poor nation with stupendously rich individuals.\u201d\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, about twenty five (25) aspirants had picked the APC forms, while seventeen (17) picked the forms on the PDP platform.\n\nThe PDP is said to have raked in about N640 million (over half a billion naira) from the sales of form to the 17 aspirants that were screened for the presidential ticket primaries. Two however, were disqualified without promise of refund.\n\nIf you sum the amount from both parties, money realised from the sales of nomination forms for Senate, House of representatives, governorship and state Houses of assembly, and for forms by aspirants in other lesser known parties, the Nigerian political space is richer with over N4 billion realised from sale of nomination forms alone.\n\nThe over N4billion is the reason many concerned citizens are forced to ask, \u201cIs Nigeria on sale?\u201d\n\nKey Ministers in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, including Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi; Labour and Employment Minister, Chris Ngige, and Science, Technology and Innovation Minister, Ogbonnaya Onu, were among those that picked the Presidential nomination forms.\n\nRecall that President Muhammadu Buhari and other contestants had paid N27million for the same forms in 2015 when the APC was seeking power.\n\nAs at the weekend, about 25 aspirants had purchased the APC forms, with Vice President Yemi Osibanjo; the party\u2019s national leader, Bola Tinubu, Godswill Akpabio, Rochas Okorocha, Ibikunle Amosu, Tunde Bakare, Adams Oshiomhole, Ben Ayade, governor of Cross River State, and Dave Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State, making the list.\n\nOthers include Kayode Fayemi, Emeka Nwajiuba, Ken Nnamani, Yahaya Bello, Abubakar Badaru, Ahmed Lawan, Sani Yerima, a former governor of Zamfara State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole.\n\nYet others include, Aishat Alubankudi, Uju Ohanenye, Nicholas Nwagbo, Ajayi Borrofice, and Orji Kalu.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) on the other hand, cleared 15 out of the 17 aspirants who picked the party\u2019s nomination forms, including former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar; former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel; former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose, and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\nOthers are Chikwendu Kalu; Governors Bala Mohammed, and Nyesom Wike; Dele Momodu, Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, Tariela Oliver and Bukola Saraki.\n\nThe party however, could not clear Nwachukwu Anakweze, and Cosmos Ndukwe.\n\nNo official reasons had been given for dropping them, it is however, speculated that while Anakweze, a medical practitioner who had spent all his life in the United States, may have run short of some of the requirements, Cosmos Ndukwe may have been dropped for taking the party to court.\n\nNdukwe, a proponent of zoning, had asked the Court to compel the PDP to zone the party\u2019s ticket to the South East; he also requested the Court to stop the party from holding its forthcoming convention, unless the ticket is zoned to the South East.\n\nWhile the male contestants paid a total of N41 million each for the nomination forms, the only female aspirants paid only N6m, as fixed by the party.\n\nModibo Bakari, a legal practitioner, described the large number of aspirants as necessary under a democracy.\n\n\u201cWell, I believe that is what democracy is about. More people should be encouraged to participate. But my real worry is the high cost of the forms. Again, I also feel that it is meant to ensure that only the really serious aspirants join the race,\u201d Bakari said.\n\nReacting to the crave for power and the mammoth crowd jostling to succeed Buhari, Osita Nwanjo, a lawyer, described the cost of nomination forms by the APC, as \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never really believed that President Buhari was fighting corruption, otherwise, many of his Ministers will not do what they are doing now,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on why the Ministers did not resign before picking the forms, he blamed the confusion on attempt by the government to manipulate the 2022 Electoral Law.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe amendment to Section 84(12) has remained in contention following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s protests over the statutory provision which had prohibited political appointees from voting as either delegates in party conventions or congresses for the election or nomination of candidates.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that a Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State, in a ruling set aside the provisions in section 84(12), as the presiding Judge, Evelyn Anyadike, declared the provisions as \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe Judge stated that the provision is in conflict with the Nigerian constitution, adding that it \u201cought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nChijoke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker and an aspirant in the Arochukwu/Ohaofia Federal Constituency, lamented that Nigeria was indeed on sale and to the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cI am a commercial lawyer who earns legitimate income. By the way things are going now, I may not be able to contest for the Arochukwu/Ohaofia Federal Constituency because of the hike in the price of the nomination form. The truth is that if I muster the courage to buy the form and later win the election, I will have to recoup my money before looking at my constituents, which I think is wickedness and I will not forgive myself if I do that,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, Umelahi said that with the current and deadly trend set by the APC and copied by the PDP, Nigerian politics is now sadly for the highest bidders and the moneybags are in the game for their selfish interest, while the masses will continue to surfer after the 2023 elections.\n\nVenting his anger on the masses, who are taking anything from the politicians, Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian environment and human rights researcher, disclosed that the unimaginable prices of the forms are enough reasons to protest, lobby INEC to checkmate party excesses, including the unnecessary hike in the nomination forms.\n\n\u201cI live abroad and I have seen citizens here protest for just one hour power outage, they have parked their cars and empty themselves on the roads because of a meager increase on gasoline price; they have recalled many nonperforming representatives, so why are the Nigerian masses who suffer the most not interested in getting 2023 right by insisting on the right thing from now? I don\u2019t see change in 2023 because the masses are not ready to take on politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the large number of aspirants, Umelahi said that the parties are culprits and that they intentionally allowed everyone who can pay to pick the form, which he said \u201ccomplicates issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf PDP or APC had zoned the tickets, all the barrage of aspirants would not have emerged. In 1999, the two major parties zoned the ticket to South West to compensate them for the death of Moshood Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the presidential election earlier.\n\nRead also: NESG releases action plan to manage Nigeria\u2019s \u2018rising debt\u2019 burden\n\n\u201cSo, why can\u2019t the parties say this time it is going to the South East, South-South or even South West to reduce the numbers. It is not all about making money because the wrong candidates who can buy party delegates\u2019 votes will emerge at the end and lead the country further into deep disaster, economic turmoil and unrests,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBut Olumide Akinola, a former banker, who is an APC aspirant for a seat in the Ogun State House of Assembly, noted that ordinarily, the EFCC should have arrested anybody who have paid the N100 million or N40 million for the APC and PDP nomination forms to question their source and also investigate the parties for hiking the prices.\n\n\u201cWith the forms in the hundreds of millions, Nigeria is truly on sale and it is only moneybags that can bid the highest and will carry the day. Sadly, the government is no longer fighting corruption, the EFCC is doing nothing, and criminals are bidding for stakes in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2015 APC fielded five presidential aspirants in its primaries, while Goodluck Jonathan ran unopposed in the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) primaries in 2015\n\nIn 2019 PDP fielded 12 presidential aspirants at the primaries, while President Muhammadu Buhari was the only aspirant for APC in 2019.\n\nIt is surprising to many observers that despite the high fees charged by the parties, a lot more people are picking the forms. They also question the source of such funds.\n\nSome political watchers presumed that some of the aspirants are not serious about their ambition and are only in the race to negotiate their political future.\n\nIt is believed that most of them would not even go into the contest and would eventually bow out of the race at the last minute.\n\nSome experts have also said the large number of aspirants would help to deepen democracy and was also a test for Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nOthers have said the high number of aspirants ahead 2023 was not new, noting that usually when a sitting president, governor or local government chairman is completing the second term there is always an avalanche of aspirants.\n\n\u201cUsually when a sitting president, governor or local government chairman is completing the second term we have an avalanche of aspirants. Look back at 2007 and 2015.A greater number of them can\u2019t win their ward election not to talk about local government area,\u201d Tade Ademola, public affairs analyst and politician, said.\n\nTade added that most of the aspirants were in the race to fight for their political future.\n\n\u201cThis is what is known as buying relevance. They will be recognised as aspirants in the presidential or governorship cadre and could be lobbied to drop their ambition and agreements will be reached for compensation.\n\n\u201cIt clouds the polity and puts serious contenders on their toes or drives them off, leaving charlatans in the field. It is not good for our democracy because it usually doesn\u2019t allow electors to vet the better candidate of the lot,\u201d Tade added.\n\nAnayo Ezegwu, a political pundit, equally dismissed some of the presidential aspirants, saying that several of them were in the race to seek political relevance and know they could not win even if they are given the party ticket.\n\n\u201cMost of them know that on their capacity and achievements, they can never win the ticket but the support would guarantee them ministerial appointment. Politics is a game and Nigerian politicians are currently playing it to the fullest,\u201d Ezegwu said.\n\nTony Abolo, a Benin-based communication expert, told BusinessDay Sunday that there are several interpretations for the increasing numbers of presidential aspirants currently seen ahead of the primaries for both the PDP and APC.\n\n\u201cThese aspirants are not looking at the electorate or what is going on in the country. What is their pedigree? What have they done in their states as governors, senators or ministers? They couldn\u2019t run a state or make a difference, and they want to run Nigeria. In this election, there are contenders, more pretenders, and jokers among those seeking for the number one office as against the previous election year.\n\n\u201cThe possibilities why there are more candidates wanting the job of the presidency this time around is clear. First, it is the typical Nigerian vindictiveness; they look at it as a North, South desire for the presidency.\n\n\u201cThe other reason could be the hope that by the time they all come out, some may bargain their way to the Vice Presidency or bargain to step down to collect money. It all looks like a joke, but we Nigerians are creative and crafty.\n\n\u201cLastly, it could also be indicative of Buhari\u2019s incompetence over the years, and many more people are angry and want the job. They want to make themselves available to run this country effectively,\u201d he added.\n\nBright Oniovokukor, project director, Indomitable Youths Organisation (IYO), a non-governmental organisation, said: \u201cWe are having too many aspirants because the southerners want to take the job this time around. The same thing also played out like this few years ago, with a lot of people coming out from the south to contest.\n\n\u201cFor me, it is a greedy approach on the part of the southerners because if you look at this numbers of persons jostling for the presidency, most of them are from the south. Is it that they cannot support themselves to rule the country? I see it as an element of greed on their part, indecision and lack of trust for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Oniovokukor, \u201cAll of them jostling for the position are one and the same group of persons. They are from the same clique. It is necessary to ask if the presidency is a joke?\u201d\n\nA deviation from the past\n\nWhile only Abduljhalil Tafawa-Balewa, son of Nigeria\u2019s first Prime Minister and Akasuba Abiola, wife of the late business mogul, Moshood Abiola contested the PDP presidential ticket with former President Goodluck Jonathan prior to the 2015 general election, this time around, the party has screened 17 aspirants.\n\nSimilarly, only five aspirants contested for the APC ticket in the build up to the 2015 election which included the incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Rabiu Kwankwaso, former Kano governor, Rochas Okorocha, former Imo State governor and the late Sam Nda-Isaiah, publisher of Leadership newspaper.\n\nThe number of aspirants for the APC presidential ticket keeps swelling by the day with about 25 persons who have already picked the forms.\n\nThe volcanic-like eruption in the number of presidential aspirants is a source of worry to concerned Nigerians who wonder the motive behind their ambitions as only one person is eventually going to emerge as candidate of his or her party.\n\nChristian Okeke, political science lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka said he suspected that many of those who have picked forms are not really aspirants but political investors or jobbers.\n\nOkeke told BusinessDay that: \u201cExcept they know what others don\u2019t, otherwise I\u2019m convinced that most of them are aware that they will never make it to becoming candidates.\n\n\u201cHowever, you know that political elite in Africa and perhaps, other third world countries including Nigeria are opportunists. In times like this, they use their wealth to position themselves for potential dividends in the coming political dispensation.\n\n\u201cAsk them what they understand by loyalty and patriotism, they don\u2019t know. Ask them about viable solution to the challenges of their society; you will be amazed how blank they are. That is the sad tale of Africa that has kept us where we are today.\u201d\n\nHe argued that it is the same political elite, national bourgeoisie and veteran politicians that are responsible for the underdevelopment of their geo-political space and people that are aspiring to the highest office of the land.\n\n\u201cFor instance, while they keep the education sector here in comatose, their children are fast graduating from schools abroad. I am strongly persuaded that the army of presidential aspirants that we see today is for various reasons.\n\n\u201cSome are coming as tools for parties\u2019 and national destabilisation. But majority is purely driven by quest for self-preservation. Permit me to say that if care is not taken, the country will be for sale again in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI suspect that these jostlers or their cronies will get juicy appointments in gross advancement of the cycle of chronic cronyism where they will be positioned for the business of milking the country dry for the purpose of recouping their investment.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the number of persons coming out to contest the presidential tickets should be a statement as per the degree of political participation and inclusiveness in Nigeria. One should have seen is a positive development coming out of our democratisation process. But here, we hardly trust politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am particularly suspicious about what is going on in the ruling party. However, the members there know better. For now, let the rest of us pretend that it is for all good and that all is well,\u201d Okeke argued further.",

More importantly is the fact that having been paid by customers in advance for flight bookings we are bound by contract to deliver the services already paid for, to avoid exposing the airline to the risk of avoidable litigation.\n\n\u201cApart from the above factors, Ibom Air is currently the only airline serving Akwa Ibom State directly and as such, any voluntary stoppage of operations would completely cut off access by air into and out of the State. Such action would be directly in conflict with and detrimental to the interest of our shareholder,\u201d the airline explained.\n\nThe airline added that in view of the foregoing facts, Ibom Air has respectfully disagreed with the decision of AON to suspend flight operations on Monday 09 May 2022 and cannot in the circumstance volunteer to stop operating and will continue normal operations on Monday 09 May 2022 and beyond.\n\nThe airline however hinted that it\u2019s inclusion as \u201csignatory\u201d to the statement released by AON must have derived from its active and committed membership of the AON.\n\n\u201cThe above notwithstanding, we identify very strongly with our AON colleagues and will participate in every effort to resolve this frightening situation as soon as possible in the interest of our business, our customers, our stakeholders and our country,\u201d the airline added.",

The media chooses which issues to highlight to its viewers and how to frame them, influencing what people perceive to be a priority.\n\n\u201cWhen the public discussion about a particular topic is structured in such a way that it creates a sense of outrage and menace, people will put pressure on their leaders to put that issue at the top of the political agenda.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which the media presents information shapes audience perceptions. When communicating a message, the media transmits not just the content of the message, but also their interpretation of it.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the state government\u2019s intervention in tackling erosion in the state, Obaseki said that the state government has built a total length of over 40 kilometers of secondary drains.\n\n\u201cWe have built a total length of over 40kms of secondary drains. This excludes over 400km constructed by other ministries and agencies; over 14kms of primary stormwater culverts, drains and over 4km of earth storm water channels. This is more than what has been done by any other government in the history of the state.\n\nOn his part, the Resident Engineer and ZUTARI Consultant, Mr Almeroux Loubser, said global warming has contributed to the excessive rains while advocating for use of green energy solutions to reduce burning of fossils.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

You are sensitive; you come with a lot of sensitivities and you have that displayed always, even when we go through contentious issues in our meetings.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that you are a patriot and as a democrat, I like your spirit which is why democracy is about contestation.

Some of the critics, among those who are the Ondo and Sokoto State governors, have asked the financial expert to turn in his resignation letter as CBN Governor to concentrate on his political career.\n\nBut the EYL in a statement, Sunday, by Alhaji Kabiru Yusuf, its leader, took exception to the criticisms that have trailed the development, noting that leaving the current President of the African Development Bank and former Minister of Agriculture, Dr Akiwumi Adesina, who also obtained the form, out and singling Emefiele out in the actions, was an ethnic bias.\n\n\u201cWe have just witnessed a brazen display of ethnic bigotry from the likes of Governor Akeredolu, Professor Sagay, and Mr Omoyele Sowore, who have come out to openly attack the person of the CBN Governor on hearing that form has been purchased for him.\n\n\u201dThey are calling for his resignation while also keeping mute on the purchase of the APC nomination form by the President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina who holds a similar office. Why not also ask Adesina to resign or call for his sack.\n\n\u201cThis only amounts to ethnic attack against the CBN Governor, who is not their kinsman.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government may incur N3.55trillion in petrol under-recovery cost, better known as subsidy in 2022, a report by Cordros Securities said at the weekend.\n\nThe price of Brent, Nigeria\u2019s variant was put at $116.40 per barrel on Friday, with the likelihood of a further escalation in price, a development that analysts believed will raise under-recovery costs over the short-to-medium term.\n\nUnder-recovery is a term used to denote the notional losses that oil companies incur due to the difference between the subsidised price at which the oil marketing companies sell certain products like petrol and the price which they should have received for meeting their cost of production.\n\nRelying on the recently released data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Cordros Securities analysts in the report said the upward swing in the price of crude oil will increase the burden of bridging the gap between the actual cost of petrol and the subsidised rate at which the product is sold to the Nigerian public.\n\n\u201cWe expect under-recovery costs to increase significantly over the short-to-medium term, given the rise in crude oil prices compared to the 2021FY levels. Consequently, we estimate petrol under-recovery cost to settle at N3.55 trillion (or 56.8 per cent of our estimated FGN\u2019s retained revenue) in 2022E (vs 2021FY: N1.61 trillion or 34.3 per cent of FGN\u2019s retained revenue),\u201d the report said.\n\nRelying on the NNPC\u2019s data, the report said the corporation incurred N245.77 billion as petrol under-recovery cost in March (February: N219.79 billion). It further explained that the under-recovery cost for the review month consists of the previous months\u2019 outstanding and part of the February 2022 value shortfall.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201dthe tally brings the total under-recovery cost in Q1-22 to N675.94 billion\u2013 3.4x the size in Q1-21 (N197.74 billion). That said, the NNPC further estimated that it would deduct N671.88 billion from April proceeds due to be shared by the three tiers of government at the May FAAC meeting.\u201d It, therefore, explained that the estimated deduction consists of N519.00 billion as petrol under-recovery cost in April and N152.88 billion for March.\n\nThe report noted that apart from the impact of the under-recovery activities on the economy, another cause of concern is the sustained decline in oil production in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the recently released data by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production (including condensates) declined by 1.9 per cent to 1.49 million barrels per day in March (February: 1.52mb/d). Accordingly, average crude oil production (including condensates) settled at 1.56mb/d in Q1-22 (Q4-21: 1.51mb/d and Q1-21: 1.74mb/d).\n\nThe report maintained that \u201cthe persistent low crude oil production volume reflects the pass-through impact of (1) infrastructure decay, (2) massive thefts and vandalism, and (3) divestments, given the challenging business environment amidst companies\u2019 move to cleaner energy sources.\n\nThe report, therefore, said that the consistent low crude oil production volume suggests that the oil GDP could drag overall growth in 2022FY amidst the continued resilience of the non-oil sector.\n\n\u201cOverall, we do not expect a significant improvement in crude oil production over the short term, given the nature of challenges hampering production. Despite the rally in crude oil prices, we expect the government\u2019s oil revenue performance to remain underwhelming over the short term,\u201d the report explained.",

It is a conspiracy against the South by the North for the two major parties, PDP and APC to project Northern candidates in 2023\u2033.\n\nCD said this is a calculation of underestimation on the part of the North to attempt to take advantage of the South.\n\nThe group urged the South West governors to call on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to consider zoning ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nIt also called on PDP leaders to pick their candidate from the South, stressing that \u201d It is a pandora box yet to be unlocked if the two leading parties fail to allow other ethnic nationalities to produce the president at their due time. It will coast the country into yet another crisis that may sink the entire nation\u201d\n\nCD added that anyone in his right senses should know that jetisoning power shift to the South is a direct invitation to serious civil strife that may lead to outright balkanization of the country.\n\n\u201cOur Politicians should reminisce on the past political events, how political and religious intolerance and impatience has caused our illustrious sons and daughters their early death. It is on record that political, religious and ethnic chauvinism accelerated the death of Chief MKO Abiola, General Sani Abacha, Rear Admiral Elegbede, Alhaja Suliat, Mrs Kudirat Abiola and a host of other prominent Nigerians who were massacred between 1993 and 1999.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we draw the line by sounding another warning to the politicians to play the chess game with all sense of maturity and patriotism so that Nigeria will not be returned to another evil days of the military rule, because democracy can only be enduring if its managers are fair to one another, to their conscience and to the nation\u201d",

          "text": "Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has declared that if offered the opportunity to lead Nigeria from May 29, 2023, he will confront and tame principalities, as well as those who consider themselves as the owners of Nigeria while upholding the rule of law.\n\nFayemi has also disclosed that Nigeria \u201cis at war,\u201d and recommended counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism measures that would go beyond infantry and other approaches to warfare.\n\nHe made these revelations on Friday at a session with political stakeholders and journalists in Abuja after declaring his interest to seek the nomination of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nResponding to a myriad of challenges facing the country, Fayemi identified impunity as a very serious issue, that the commitment, compassion, and competence of a leader alone would not address.\n\nFayemi said what \u201cis lacking in Nigeria is the leadership and courage to do that what is right. Some people consider themselves as principalities and people who believe that they are the owners of this country.\n\n\u201cThey believe they can do whatever they like. They believe the law cannot catch up with them. We will not be arbitrary. But we will be very sneaky about upholding the rule of law, and access to justice for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe must at all times be advocates of citizen\u2019s rights, as well as responsibilities. Because when you have rights, you also have responsibilities as a citizen of the country. We must uphold this value and live by it.\n\n\u201cImpunity reigns because our justice system has been crippling and because the entire justice sector system in our country is problematic. If we look at the journey from the investigation of the crime, to the conviction of the crime you would have forgotten that the person committed the crime.\n\n\u201cI think swift delivery of justice, access to justice, and accountability in society are areas we need to pay attention to. We need to support our judicial officers so that we will not again tempt them to resort to other misbehaviour because the state has not taken on its responsibility in terms of remuneration and terms of support to the judicial officers.\u201d\n\nOn the spate of insecurity nationwide, Fayemi acknowledged the asymmetric nature of security challenges confronting the country, which he said, required devising unconventional measures to guarantee peace, security, and stability across the federation.\n\nHe suggested that a new force posture \u201chas to be developed by our military because we are not fighting a conventional war. Such a posture must be developed to respond to a new security environment and a new order of battle.\n\n\u201cWhat we are dealing with now is unconventional. More often than not, we do not even see the people that you are fighting,\u201d Fayemi observed with grave concern for the future of Nigeria.\n\nThe Ekiti governor, therefore, canvassed the need \u201cto devise counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism measures that will go beyond infantry and other extreme approaches to warfare. We are at war.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that what happened in the train attack \u201cis an indication that we need to take immediate measures. Around the suburb of Abuja, I hear some of these things are also beginning to happen.\n\n\u201cWe need to watch. I know President Muhammadu Buhari is not a man of many words. He is taking too many steps that some of us may not be able to speak to. He is also preventing many things that they cannot also come up and say.\n\n\u201cThe task of securing is ongoing. It is continuous. It is a work in progress. We must have faith. But we must take adequate steps on intelligence, on better recruitment and equipment to address the issue,\u201d Fayemi advised on how to handle insecurity in the federation.\n\nHe cited the example of Egypt, which according to him, was not up to half of Nigeria\u2019s population, but appreciated the socio-economic and political implication of building a strong and virile police force.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are told Egypt has one million police officers. In Nigeria, we have well, we always tell ourselves we have 350, 000 policemen. But 150, 000 amongst them are doing VIP duties.\u201d\n\nHe explained how Egypt was able \u201cto recruit in an emergency manner in 1967. It moved from an army of 10,000 to 250,000 within the space of one year,\u201d thereby emphasising the need to devise practicable means of recruiting more men and women into the forces.\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",

          "text": "One of Africa\u2019s leading investors and philanthropists, Mr Tony Elumelu has challenged the United States to shift emphasis from providing aid to governments in Africa to supporting institutions that help empower a burgeoning population of youths through businesses and job creation.\n\nElumelu, who is the Chairman of United Bank for Africa Plc and Founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), has also identified a strong private sector as a critical driver of peace, stability, and development on the continent.\n\nHe made these remarks recently during the fireside conversation co-hosted by the US Institute of Peace (USIP) and the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. Elumelu challenged the US authorities to re-image his approach to African development.\n\nSpeaking at the forum, Elumelu said promoting business formation \u201cis no substitute for strengthening Africa\u2019s weak infrastructure, governance and institutions, neither are challenging business conditions a reason to delay unleashing the entrepreneurial energies of African youth.\u201d\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nElumelu, whose foundation trains, supports and provides seed capital to would-be entrepreneurs across the continent, called for a re-imagined US relationship with Africa.\n\nHe said: \u201cWashington needs to shift its focus from aid that inevitably encourages dependency to support for institutions that help empower a burgeoning population through businesses and the jobs they support.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship, peace, and conflict are linked one way or the other. Young people, who are engaged in bettering their own lives and their communities will reject the lures of extremism and crime,\u201d he said at the forum held at USIP\u2019s head office.\n\nAsked what the US can do to improve Africa\u2019s governance, Elumelu said people \u201care beginning to wonder if the US is still there for Africa because of the foray into Africa by other world powers.\u201d\n\nElumelu, who committed $100 million to raise African entrepreneurs for 10 years, said the US \u201cremains admired and respected in Africa. But a critical step will be to make sure aid makes it past the last mile to its intended recipients and purposes.\u201d\n\nHe observed that another step \u201cwill be supporting institutional infrastructure that helps address sustainability. The US policymakers and financial institutions should impress on African leaders how their own political goals and private sector success are linked.\n\n\u201cOverall, there needs to be a reimagining of what Africa needs, a necessity demonstrated by a dangerous level of youth unemployment that is not improving,\u201d UBA\u2019s chairman explained.\n\nElumelu also expressed grave concern about the recent string of coups across Africa, which according to him, should serve as a wake-up call for the urgency of addressing the social and economic conditions that lead to political instability.\n\nUBA\u2019s chairman pointed to a partnership with Google as a good example of the relationship, which he believed, could promote entrepreneurship among young Africans.\n\nHe explained that the tech giant \u201chas committed a team to expand the training capacity of the Tony Elumelu Foundation\u2019s digital network, which already includes about a million active and aspiring entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cAs the foundation\u2019s programme can only accept up to 2,000 students from 350,000 applicants, Google is helping develop a training platform with unlimited reach keyed to African conditions.\n\n\u201cThat digital partnership is such critical support for Africa. Our Internet connectivity? Not so great. Available bandwidth? Not so great. Yet, this young African is connected to the rest of the world. That is an area we know we need to focus on.\u201d\n\nElumelu cited his own story as a hopeful example of what African entrepreneurs could achieve and the impact they could have on the continent.\n\nBorn to a modest family in Jos, Plateau State, Elumelu narrated how he began his working life as a copy machine salesman after university.\n\nHe said a lucky break \u201clanded him my first job in banking, where I worked my way into the executive ranks.

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has rejected the request by telecom operators for an upward review of tariff, saying that any such decision must be fair to the subscribers and engender healthy competition among services providersa.\n\nIn a statement issued at the weekend, NCC said there is no cause for alarm as it did not approve any increase, adding that it remained committed to international best practices and established procedures in its regulatory activities in the country.\n\nTelecom providers under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) had written to the NCC seeking an upward review of voice calls, SMS and data cost tariffs by 40 per cent due to the high cost of operations.\n\nBut in a statement by its Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, NCC stated that any tariff increase by telecoms service providers must be approved by the commission guided by regular cost-based and empirical studies to determine the appropriate cost to be adopted by the service providers.\n\nAdinde noted that the commission received the request letter from ALTON about the proposed increase but stated that any decision in that regard must be fair enough to the subscribers and engender healthy competition among services providers.\n\nPart of the statement reads, \u201cConsistent with international best practice and established regulatory procedures, the NCC ensures its regulatory activities are guided by regular cost-based and empirical studies to determine the appropriate cost (upper and floor price) within which service providers are allowed to charge their subscribers for services delivered.\n\n\u201cThe commission ensures that any cost determined, as an outcome of such transparent studies is fair enough to enhance healthy competition among operators, provide wider choices for the subscribers as well as ensure the sustainability of the Nigerian telecoms industry.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, and contrary to MNOs\u2019 agitation to increase tariffs for voice and Short Messaging Services (SMS) by a certain percentage, the commission wishes to categorically inform telecoms subscribers and allay the fears of Nigerians that no tariff increase will be effected by the operators without due regulatory approval by the commission.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that tariff regulations and determinations are made by the commission in line with the provisions of Sections 4, 90, and 92 of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003, which entrusts the commission with the protection and promotion of the interests of subscribers against unfair practices including but not limited to; matters relating to tariffs and charges.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out that the current tariff regime administered by the service providers is a product of NCC\u2019s decision both for voice and SMS.\n\nIt however added that \u201cwhile there could be justifiable reasons for MNOs\u2019 demand for tariff increase, it should be noted that they are not allowed to do such either individually or collectively without recourse to NCC, following the outcome of a cost study. This is not the case for now.\n\n\u201cThrough NCC\u2019s commitment to engendering healthy competition among the licensees, the cost of services has been democratised and become more and more affordable for Nigerian subscribers. The regulator is even more committed to this cause to ensure subscribers get greater value for money spent on telecom services.\u201d\n\nLast week, ALTON wrote a letter to the NCC, the telecoms industry regulator, calling for an upward review of the cost of telecoms services.\n\nThe operators urged the NCC to consider the move for an upward review of the cost of SMS from N4 to N5.61k and voice call termination rate from N6.40k per minute to N8.95k per minute.\n\nThe operators said the move to increase the cost of telecom services became necessary due to the high cost of delivering telecoms services across networks, coupled with the harsh business environment and the continuous rise in the cost of various items in various sectors of the Nigeria economy.\n\nFestus Akanbi",

          "title": "Nigeria Moves to Avert Shutdown of Operations by Airlines on May 9",
          "text": "Following a threat by airline operators to shut down their operations on Monday, May 9, over the scarcity of aviation fuel, the federal government has appealed to operators to reconsider their decision, stressing that it has engaged the relevant stakeholders to address the issue of scarcity of aviation fuel.\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives through its Committee on Aviation has appealed to the airlines to suspend the plan to ground their operations.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), which was signed by the President of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), Mr Serina Abdulmunaf, the operators had threatened to shut down operations on Monday due to high cost of aviation fuel and other operational costs.\n\nThe operators had noted in the letter that aviation fuel price (JetA1) had risen from N190 per litre to N700, and described the rise as \u201castronomical\u201d.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cWhile aviation fuel worldwide is said to constitute about 40 per cent of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally, the present hike has shot up Nigeria\u2019s operating cost to about 95 per cent.\n\n\u201cIn the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down, to no success,\u201d he said.\n\nThe airlines said that the situation had made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria an average of N120,000.\n\nBut in a swift response, Sirika on Saturday appealed to airline operators to consider the multiplier effect of shutting down operations on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking their business-informed decisions and actions.\n\nSirika, in a statement issued in Abuja by his Special Assistant on Public Affairs, Mr James Odaudu, noted the \u201creports that the nation\u2019s air transportation system will be disrupted as from Monday, May 9, 2922, following threats by airline operators to shut down operations as a result of the rising cost of Jet A1, otherwise known as aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly concerned about the difficulties being faced by the airline operators in the country in procuring aviation fuel which has resulted in spiralling costs in Air transportation in the immediate past,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement further said: \u201cWe also acknowledge that the airline operators are in the business to make profits while servicing the very critical sector that is not only the preferred mode of transport for most Nigerians but also the main international gateway to the nation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the issue of fuel supply is not within the purview of the ministry and so the much it can do in the present situation is to engage with agencies, institutions and individuals in positions to provide succour to the airlines. This is already being done by the relevant team led by the Honourable Minister,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement noted that while the efforts to assuage the situation are on, \u201cwe wish to appeal to the airline operators, even in the difficult situation, to consider the multiplier effect of shutting down operations, on Nigerians and global travellers, in taking their business-informed decisions and actions.\n\n\u201cWe also assure Nigerians, especially stakeholders in the sector, that the Buhari administration remains stoic in its commitment to the creation and sustenance of an environment that promotes the growth of the aviation industry where major players like the airlines can operate in a profitable and competitive market,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIn the letter to Sirika by the operators, Abdulmunaf had stated that the airlines appreciate the efforts of the current government to boost the growth of air transport in the country, and regretted the inconveniences the \u201cvery difficult decision may cause our customers\u201d.\n\nAbdulmunaf also lamented that the cost of aviation fuel had continued to rise unabated thereby creating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines.\n\n\u201cThis situation is unsustainable and the airlines can no longer absorb the pressure.\u201d\n\nHe, however, appealed to travellers to kindly reconsider their travel itinerary and make alternative arrangements.\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives through its House Committee on Aviation has appealed to the airlines to suspend the plan to ground their operations.\n\nThe Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation, Hon. Nnolim Nnaji disclosed yesterday that the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila was greatly disturbed by the reoccurring aviation fuel crisis in the country.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives consequently plans to take far-reaching decisions on the matter as soon as possible to ensure that the problem is permanently rested,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to the Airline Operators of Nigeria to rescind action on its planned shutdown of operations due to the escalating cost of aviation fuel, Jet-A1\n\nNnaji who regretted that despite the last intervention of the leadership of the House of Representatives, the problem remained unabated, assured the airlines that his committee and indeed the House leadership were not sleeping over their plight.\n\nNnaji who commended the operators for their patriotism further urged them not to ground their operations stressing that \u201csuch will inflict more pains on our already distressed economy\u201d.\n\nHe also pledged that \u201cthe National Assembly is determined to ensure that the aviation fuel crisis is urgently resolved because air transportation has become the safest mode of travel.\u201d\n\nIbom Air Opts Out of Plan to Stop Operations\n\nIn a related development, the Akwa Ibom State-owned airline, Ibom Air has indicated that it would opt out of the plan to suspend flights on May 9, 2022.\n\nIn a statement signed by management, the airline said, \u201cIbom Airlines Limited (Ibom Air) has been inundated with inquiries about what will happen on Monday 09 May 2022, following the public statement issued by the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) executive, on Friday, May 6, 2022, and it has become necessary for us to make the following clarifications: Ibom Air acknowledges the existential threat that these runaway fuel price increases pose for the air transport industry in Nigeria. We agree that this out-of-control situation is simply unsustainable. However, every airline has its unique business model and pressures. We believe that despite the escalating fuel prices, airlines volunteering to stop operations would rather exacerbate an already bad situation.\n\n\u201cIbom Air has financial obligations to suppliers, financiers and staff, which depend on an uninterrupted flow of revenue to service. More importantly is the fact that having been paid by customers in advance for flight bookings, we are bound by contract to deliver the services already paid for, to avoid exposing the airline to the risk of avoidable litigation. Apart from the above factors, Ibom Air is currently the only airline serving Akwa Ibom State directly and as such, any voluntary stoppage of operations would completely cut off access by air into and out of the State. Such action would be directly in conflict with and detrimental to the interest of our shareholder.\u201d\n\nThe airline stated that given the foregoing facts, it has respectfully disagreed with the decision of AON to suspend flight operations, adding that it cannot in the circumstance volunteer to stop operating and would continue normal operations on Monday and beyond.\n\nIbom Air, however, said it identified with AON and would participate in every effort to resolve this frightening situation as soon as possible in the interest of the airline business, customers, stakeholders and the country.\n\nChinedu Eze in Lagos and Kasim Sumaina in Abuja",
