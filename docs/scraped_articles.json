          "text": ".\n\nDayo Johnson Akure\n\nLeaders and youths in Ifon Community, in the Ose council area of Ondo state, have cried out over high profile killings by gunmen in the area.\n\nRecall that a first-class traditional ruler, the Olufon of lfon Oba Israel Adegoke Adewusi was gruesomely murdered by suspected herdsmen at Elegbeka village while returning from a meeting in Akure, the state capital on November 26 last year.\n\nAlso, last week, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressive Congress in the state and a member of the state executive committee, Hon Dele Isibor, was shot dead by suspected kidnappers along Imoru road in Ifon town.\n\nThe Coordinator of Progressive Minds, Hon. Olaniyi Eni-Olotu at a meeting in lfon, who lamented the killings said that\u201d the killing of Isibor which occurred last weekend, was coming when the area was yet to recover from the sudden killing of the Olufon of Ifon, late Oba Israel Adegoke Adeusi on the 26th of November, 2020 by yet to be identified gunmen at Elegbeka village while returning from a meeting in Akure\n\nEni-Olotu said that the community was again thrown into \u201canother round of pandemonium on the 13th of June, 2021, when kidnappers struck again along Imoru road in Ifon town, shooting sporadically at all the vehicles plying the route last weekend.\n\n\u2018\u201dThis unfortunate incidence led to the killing of the APC chieftain, Dele Isibor, having sustained severe injuries from the gunshot and four people were kidnapped by the gunmen.\n\n\u201d The influx of the heavily armed herdsmen from other neighbouring states into the forest reserves and farmland in and around the community is now making life miserable for farmers and the inhabitants of the area.\n\nEni-Olotu said it is so sad to note that the Police Divisional Headquarters in Ifon as well as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ifon office have no functional patrol vehicles which constitutes a major challenge for the security agencies in doing their job effectively and efficiently.\n\nHe pleaded with the state government for special consideration to be given to Ifon indigenes for the recruitment into the Amotekun Corps, as they are more familiar with the terrain and work more to fight insecurity confronting the area.\n\nThe community, he added also pleaded for the intervention of the President, Inspector General of Police and the Government to fish out the killers of Oba Israel Adegoke Adeusi and Dele Isibor in order to bring them to book without further delay.\n\n\u201cWe also appeal that for the provision of patrol vehicles for the security agencies in Ifon to enhance their smooth operations of securing the land, also through the heavy deployment of security operatives, especially to the forest reserves.\n\n\u201cAll illegal occupants of the forest reserves and farmlands must be chased out without further delay.\n\nOne of the community leaders, Sunday Amudeli who spoke at the meeting said that Ifon community had been in the news for over a year as a result of insecurity and other wrong reasons either about killing or kidnapping.\n\nAmudeli further stated that Ifon occupies a strategic location in the State, serving as a boundary to Edo and Ondo State.\n\n\u201c A Mobile Police Station is needed as a matter of urgency or an establishment of a Military barracks or a naval base. The community is conducive and is ready to provide the land for stability, peace and to maintain law and order.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Youths, Abdullahi Ekere said that they do not want to take law into their hands, hence they are calling on President Buhari, the IGP, Military and the state government to provide effective security in the area",

When both arms imbibe this culture of professionalism, consultation and lobbying, what you have is a strong, credible partnership that guarantees a stable polity and excellent service delivery.\n\n\u201cIt is a thing of joy that Nigeria has had twenty-two years of unbroken democratic rule. Also worthy of note is that we have made significant progress in executive-legislature relations, especially after the initial hiccups in the early years of the Fourth Republic.\n\n\u201cThe first step to building sustainable partnership between the executive and legislative arms of government for effective service delivery is for both organs of government to work with the consciousness that separation of power is imperative for good governance.\n\n\u201cEach must realise that the principle of checks and balances as constitutionally provided for, is to prevent abuse of power, which, if allowed to fester, will ultimately circumvent the rights and will of the governed. Hence, the relationship between the executive and legislature should be governed by trust, mutual respect, and deference, each bearing in mind the tenets of separation of powers as required in the presidential system of government.\n\n\u201cIt is exigent that both see themselves as complementary partners working towards the same goal, which is the development of the State for the greater good of all. Trouble looms when the executive arrogates to itself the power to do as it wills or the legislature takes undue advantage of its oversight function to twist the arms of the executive for selfish ends\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures, and Speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly, Mr Abubarkar Suleiman, said Delta State has become a reference point in any discuss on financial autonomy being the first state to commence its implementation.\n\nSuleiman maintained that the recent nation wide strike embarked upon by Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, would not have occurred if other State governors were proactive to the implementation of the financial autonomy to the states Houses of Assembly.\n\nDeputy National Chairman of the Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures and Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly, Chief Sheriff Oborevwori, said they have been enjoying financial autonomy as a House long before now.\n\nOborevwori said the State Legislatures Forum was \u201can integral part of Nigeria\u2019s political architecture and the primary of the legislature at all levels is to make laws and promote policies for peace, order and good governance.\n\n\u201cI therefore wish to sincerely urge us to seize this opportunity to ensure that the outcome of this meeting will help to shapen policies that will engender stability and peace in our country.\u201d",

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\nFormer member of the House of Representatives, Hon Tony Nwoye, has withdrawn from the race for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship ticket for Anambra State.\n\nIn a statement ahead of the primary election of PDP holding on Saturday, Nwoye instructed his supporters to vote for any aspirant of their choice.\n\nThe candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2017 Anambra State governorship election, said his decision to withdraw from the race was informed by recent developments in the PDP in the last 36 hours.\n\nNwoye\u2019s statement reads: \u201cWe all have been witnesses to the disconcerting flurry of events in our party in the last 36 hours. Developments that should be of grave concern to every true democrat and believer in the inalienability of the rights of true party people to freely choose the party\u2019s flag bearer in the upcoming gubernatorial elections in our beloved state, Anambra.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, I was still actively traversing the hinterland in my last-minute consultations/mop-up with the duly elected ad hoc delegates of the party in the 326 electoral wards of Anambra, ahead of the primaries slated for Saturday, 26th June when I was jolted by the news of the party\u2019s National Working Committee\u2019s (NWC) release concerning the party\u2019s primaries.\n\n\u201cIn the NWC release, the entire ward level executives of our party, the L.G.A executives and State executives of our party (who, by our edicts are bona fide statutory delegates) and also the elected ad hoc delegates (3 from every ward), who emerged from the duly conducted delegate election of the party that held on 10th June 2021 will no longer be voting in the primaries election. Instead, only a handful of automatic/super delegates whose names appeared in a made-up list will be deciding who flies the party\u2019s flag at the Nov 6 governorship polls holding in the state.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubt, under our Party\u2019s Constitution, Article 25(1) of the said Constitution provides that in the composition of the State Congress for the nomination of the governorship candidate, the bulk of the members and delegates that ought to vote at the primary election are the State Executive Working Committee, The Local Government Executive Working Committee, the ward executives from all the electoral wards (all as statutory delegates) and the 3 ad hoc delegates elected in the delegates\u2019 election for the purposes of the congress are to constitute the electorate at the state congress. What is at play now is that the afore-listed groups have been excluded from voting in today\u2019s Primary Election.\n\n\u201cThese excluded statutory and duly elected ad hoc delegates constitute over 94 percent of the total number of expected Delegates to vote at the Primary election! The import is that the primary election as is being purported will only be by a paltry 5 \u2013 6% percent of eligible voters. There can be no doubt that this runs against the grain of the basic tenets of participatory democracy of which I am an uncompromising proponent of.\n\n\u201cOwing to this development, I have consulted with my campaign team, teeming supporters \u2013 most of who are the bedrock of our Party at the grassroots level where I belong, and my ever supportive family, and I have come to the inevitable conclusion that the process has been greatly flawed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA process that ignores the very engine room of not just our party but of democracy itself, which is the participation of the true repository of power, the people in the primary election is against the principles I hold dear in politics. Aborting the rights of the people who represent the kindle to our possible success at the election, cannot have my participation at the Primary election.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, in standing with all the teeming excluded 3 elected ad hoc delegates, ward executives, local government, and state delegates that have been so unjustly disenfranchised for the primary.\n\n\u201cFor the reasons stated above, I hereby withdraw from participation as an aspirant in the PDP Primary election of 26th June 2021.\n\n\u201cI salute the courage of my dependable team, my fans, teeming supporters and loving family. I enjoin them to understand this painful decision which I have no doubt is the right course of action at this time.\n\n\u201cOur resolute commitment to changing a lot of the common people of our dear state for good through the instrumentality of party politics remains on course as is our personal conviction that whatever happens, power ultimately belongs to God.\n\n\u201cMy supporters and fans who are delegates are at liberty to vote for any aspirant of their choice.\u201d",

This mission is also targetted at political actors, who are collaborating with the Nigerian Government to undermine the interest of the Niger Delta people.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Nigerian Government has continued to pay deaf ears to our demands and the rising challenges in the country because the pipelines that crisscrosses our lands her left untouched, allowing dollars to flow into the federal treasury on a daily basis for mismanagement.\n\n\u201cWe shall spare no single oil installation within our range of strategic targets marked for destruction in the coming days and we bet the Nigerian Government will be humbled to return to the drawing board and chart an all-inclusive course by the time we are done with our action plan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMembers of our strike teams across the Niger Delta are commanded to be on red alert awaiting precise strike plans as mapped by the high command of the NDA.\n\nREAD ALSO: Dikio seeks change of public perception of Niger Delta\n\n\u201cThe high command of the NDA has promoted and appointed one of our finest operatives, Field Commander Tu-ere aka Queen of the Creeks to the rank of Brigadier General. She is an experienced field agent who before now was the head of the counterintelligence unit of the NDA, using her connections with top government and security officials to deliver on her assignment.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cShe was part of our elite Strike Teams that attacked and took down the Chevron Valve platform on the 4th of May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line on the 3rd of June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline on the 11th of July, 2016.\n\n\u201cBrig. Gen. Tu-ere is the first female to ever attain this level and it is solely out of merit and is placed in charge by the High Command of the NDA to execute operation humble to the later.\n\n\u201cAs a gender-friendly organization, we are using this avenue to encourage other female operatives within the rank and file of the NDA to be inspired by the rising profile of the Queen of the Creeks and never to deter in delivering on our mission of liberating our people and God-given resources from the shackles of the oppressive Nigerian Government. We advise other female operatives to emulate her and be dedicated to our mission at all times.\n\n\u201cConclusively, we wish to state unequivocally and in simple terms that we are back with operation Humble; with the aim of humbling the economy into permanent recession and political players from the Niger Delta extraction to political retirement. Our Strike Teams 01 \u2013 09 and all other formations are to regroup and remain on red alert awaiting further command.\u201d",

          "title": "Face to face with alleged murderer of super tv CEO",
          "text": "By Chioma Okezie-Okeh And Kate Halim\n\nChidinma Adaora Ojukwu, the 21-year-old girl and 300-level student of Mass Communication, University of Lagos, suspected of murdering Usifo Ataga, Chief Executive Officer, SuperTV, has, in an exclusive interview with Saturday Sun, opened up on her life trajectory that led into the heinous crime.\n\nOjukwu who spoke to our reporters at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Lagos, where she is currently being held pending the conclusion of investigation into the alleged murder and her formal charge to court, revealed, not only how she dropped out of school because of poverty but also the fact that she comes from a broken home. Asked about her mum, she said: \u201cMy dad raised me. I don\u2019t have contact with my mom. We don\u2019t talk. I have an older sister and a younger sister.\u201d\n\nOther things she told Saturday Sun include how she went into the life of drugs. Her fellow students who spoke to our paper expressed shock over her involvement with the cold-blooded murder of the TV entrepreneur. But the girl who regrets her action advises other ambitious girls to learn from her mistake.\n\nWhat Chidinma told Saturday Sun\n\nWhen the suspect was interviewed, she revealed that the last time she visited campus was before the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. As she explained, this was because there was no money for her to go back to school to continue her education pursuit.\n\nShe was also asked what the so-called \u201cRoofies\u201d was. She had taken the substance, along with Ataga, and that spiked up the man\u2019s libido and made him to start pursuing her all over the place, including around the kitchen cabinet and demanding for another round of sex, even when she was too tired to engage in such act. She revealed that it is a street lingo for Rophynol. She confessed that she started taking drugs at a party she attended one year ago. \u201cThe first time I took it, I wasn\u2019t myself. But I continued taking it because my body later got used to it. It makes me feel high\u201d, she added.\n\nAsked what the drug Rohypnol is used for, she said that it makes one feels high so much \u201cyou can do things you have never done before.\u201d\n\n\u2018Roofies\u2019 at a glance\n\nDuring her confession, Chidinma alleged that the deceased gave her Roofies about an hour before the unfortunate incident. Experts contacted by Saturday Sun confirm that roofies is a street name for Rohypnol. It is also known as \u201cForget-me pill,\u201d \u201cMexican Valium\u201d and date rape drug.\n\nBut as a tranquilizer, it is about ten times more potent than Valium. The drug is available as a white or olive-green pill and is usually sold in the manufacturer\u2019s bubble packaging. Users crush the pills and snort the powder, sprinkle it on marijuana and smoke it, dissolve it in a drink or inject it.\n\nRohypnol, they say, has been used to commit sexual assaults because it renders the victim incapable of resisting, giving it the reputation of a \u201cdate-rape\u201d drug. Its users often describe its effects as \u201cparalyzing.\u201d The effect starts 20 to 30 minutes after taking the drug and peaks within two hours. But it may persist for eight or even 12 hours. A person can be so incapacitated (made unable to act), that they collapse. They lie on the floor, eyes open, able to observe events but completely unable to move. Afterwards, memory is impaired and they cannot recall any of the things that happened. The person may experience loss of muscle control, confusion, drowsiness and amnesia. The drug is sold in Europe and Latin America as a sleeping pill, but it is illegal in the United States and Nigeria.\n\nThe real me\n\n\u2013Chidinma\n\nBut the suspect, who looked sober, also took the opportunity to talk about herself when she is not under the influence of drugs. She described herself as an introvert who goes to clubs to unwind once in a while. She was raised in Ilasa, Lagos by her uncle and aunty, she said. She attended Government Primary School.\n\nFor her secondary school education, she attended Alagomeji Secondary School, Yaba, Lagos, but initially stopped at Junior Secondary School 2 owing to paucity of fund. She later went back and continued from Senior Secondary School 1 but also stopped again due to lack of finance. She later managed to complete her secondary school education. She wrote SSCE and UTME and gained admission into the University of Lagos where she was studying Mass Communication before the incident.\n\nChidinma revealed that her dad is an accountant while her mom is a trader. Her parents are not together, she informed our reporters. They have been separated for a long time. Looking downcast, she talks about deeply regretting her action. She said that she wouldn\u2019t have done what she did if she had the opportunity to go back in time.\n\nShe advised young girls to face their education and try to live a good and modest life so that they don\u2019t end up with the wrong crowd like she did. Questioned further on her love life, she said she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend and remarked that right now she is afraid of her future, given the consequence of her action in the face of the law.\n\nThe mood in her neighboourhood and department\n\nWhen our reporters visited her neighborhood at Alagomeji, Yaba, Lagos, where she lives with her father, they found everywhere quiet and seemingly deserted. Some of the neighbours who spoke to them stated that they were shocked to learn about her involvement with the alleged murder of the TV boss.\n\nAt the Mass Communication Department, University of Lagos, where she is a 300 level student, some students were seen going about their lectures while others were seen sitting in groups and discussing the development in hush tones.\n\nOne of her course-mates who identified herself as Anita told Saturday Sun how shocked she was to learn that the innocent-looking girl she described as \u201ccool and soft-spoken\u201d is now being linked with the murder of someone. She said although the accused has admitted committing the crime, she is still finding it difficult to believe that she did it, given all that she knows about her.\n\nAnita\u2019s words: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much. We just say hi to each other whenever we meet in the department. She is so gentle and doesn\u2019t seem capable of hurting a fly. She doesn\u2019t interact with many people because she keeps to herself a lot.\u201d\n\nA young man who identified himself as Godwin Udoh also said that the alleged action of Chidinma who he said has not been to class for some time came as a big shock to him. \u201cWhen I read the story, I couldn\u2019t believe that a soft-spoken, gentle and shy girl like Chidinma could kill a man stronger than she is,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think she\u2019s not telling the whole truth.\u201d\n\nHer father is also shocked, Saturday Sun learnt. According to a police source, when detectives arrived his residence to arrest her, her father, believing that someone somewhere was either trying to frame her innocent daughter for murder that it might be a case of mistaken identity, tried to stop them from carrying out their duty. He put up stiff resistance. But somehow the operatives overpowered him and later had him arrested and taken into custody for trying to obstruct justice. But he has since been released.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

I find it difficult to run unless I hold my chest. People find it funny. Another challenge is that I can\u2019t sleep lying on my chest; it has to be either up right or sideways. It was so painful during my growing up days that I loved to sleep lying on my chest, but sadly I couldn\u2019t. It is also very hard to get my bra size in the market. Most times, I buy the biggest size and amend it especially the hands. Funny enough, I hardly wear bras even when going out. Most times, I feel all the guys that are wooing me are after my boobs. They don\u2019t care to know the real me, but want to have a feel of my boobs,\u201d she lamented.\n\nClearing the insinuations that she had her boobs enlarged for commercial purposes, Ada claimed they are natural and not enhanced. \u201cI didn\u2019t do breast enlargement, they are all-natural.

          "title": "Me, 2Face, Faze and African Queen \u2013Blackface Naija, singer",
          "text": "By Bismark Maduka\n\nWith a career spanning nearly two decades, Afropop/dancehall singer, Ahmedu Augustine popularly known as Blackface Naija, has made his mark in the Nigerian entertainment industry.\n\nHe was a member of the Plantashun Boiz alongside 2Baba and Faze, and their band went on to become one of the best of the early 2000s. To Blackface\u2019s credits, he proved his mettle as a songwriter by writing almost all the songs in Plantashun Boiz\u2019s hugely successful debut album, Body and Soul.\n\nHowever, after the group\u2019s shocking split in 2004 as a result of 2Face\u2019s exit to pursue a solo career, Blackface released a solo album, Ghetto Child the same year. The album spunned hits like Hard Life and E Dey Pain Me. Other albums followed that made him a bonafide dancehall/reggae star. But then, his feud with 2Face over the rights to African Queen, a song they both co-wrote, seems to have driven a wedge between him and the public.\n\nNevertheless, signed to Loud Houz Entertainment, Blackface continues to make music and currently has in the market an album, Rising Sun (Volume 1&2). In this in-depth interview, the Benue State-born music star shares the highs and lows of his career. Please enjoy it.\n\nBriefly introduce yourself for the benefit of the younger generation that doesn\u2019t know you.\n\nI am Ahmedu Augustine. I\u2019m a singer, songwriter and performer. I was the one that has been the leader of the group, Plantashun Boiz. I\u2019m the one that created the group. I had some members in it like Faze and 2Face. But those members are not active in the band right now. I\u2019ve come a long way. I\u2019ve done about seven albums: Ghetto Child in 2004, Evergreen in 2005, Jungle Fever in 2006, Me, Music and I in 2008, and Dancehall Business in 2010. Since 2010, I didn\u2019t put any album out until 2015 when I released another album called Defender Volume 1. In 2020, I put out another album, Rising Sun, which is Defender Volume 2. Now I\u2019m ready to drop another album called, Rising Sun 2. So, I\u2019ve just been making music. I\u2019m one of the hottest artistes right now from Africa, if you check it properly.\n\nYou started making music before the social media era, and now most new school artistes rely on social media to promote their works. Somehow it influences the listeners and the charts. How have you been able to adjust to this new era?\n\nIf you say everything is online and that\u2019s what they use to sell music in this new era, there\u2019s no difference. The only thing is just put our own music on those platforms so that people can get them as well. Because the music of yesteryears is still important to us today. So, we\u2019re not saying like the new era came and they are doing online, so the other people are not really doing their own bit. We are doing our own bit. It\u2019s just that in my old case, they\u2019ve had some people say, \u2018Oh, is it Blackface? Oh, we don\u2019t want to work with you because you\u2019re working with Blackface.\u2019 And that has really been the thing that\u2019s been going on since they plotted and planned that agenda against me a long time ago for no reason. So, even if I want to work with video directors now, that\u2019s the latest one to say, \u2018Oh, is it Blackface? We don\u2019t want to work with you\u2019. So, I don\u2019t know why they put their eyes on me and try to slow my roll. And that\u2019s factual.\n\nSo, that could be the reason why you don\u2019t collaborate as often as you used to do in the past?\n\nNo, that could be the reason why people don\u2019t see my music for them to be able to download just immediately. Because the people that are working in some of these companies will not let them put my music out so that people can download it and I can make a living off making music. So, platforms try to make themselves like it\u2019s only us that will be on the platform, and no other person is going to come unto the platform, and then shut every other person out. So, that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve been operating against me over the years. The video directors don\u2019t want to work for me, even if I\u2019m willing to pay them.\n\nIt\u2019s been that bad for me. But then it\u2019s all good. Because if I wasn\u2019t built for that to happen, I don\u2019t think it would be happening. I\u2019m to make that change and make people realize that that kind of attitude towards targeting a particular artiste, and trying to silence them or cancel them is a bad thing.\n\nI remember your song, Ahead of The Game where you featured Mallam Spicy and Rocksteady. The track was huge that year\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) Even till now. Believe you me, there\u2019s no song in Nigeria that is bigger than Ahead of The Game. All the other artistes that came into the music industry know that there\u2019s only one sound, which is still here and nobody\u2019s gonna surpass it, and I\u2019m still here.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you collaborate as often as you used to do in the past?\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between the artistes I work with. I don\u2019t always work with those people because they\u2019re not on my team. I have my own team I work with. And just the way it was when I started the Plantashun Boiz; I didn\u2019t just go and say, \u2018Yo, because there was Daddy Showkey or Baba Fryo before me, my music will sell by featuring them\u2019. I never did that. I did my own music, regardless of the people that were there and I made an impact. So, it\u2019s the same thing for me right now. I don\u2019t think I need the artistes to make the impact. I make the music for the love of it.\n\nIf Omah Lay for example reaches out to you that he wants to work with you, are you open to such collaboration?\n\nMy phones are open. They can call me if they want to work with me. But the thing is, before I work with you, the music has to be of substance, because I don\u2019t do freelance features. I don\u2019t do freestyle because I may have to be involved in writing or something else about the music. So, before I do that, I need to be sure of what it is; and if it\u2019s a full project or a single, I\u2019ve got to discuss the details. If I like the song, then we go. It\u2019s not even about money, let\u2019s talk about the music first.\n\nWhat is your opinion about the new school Nigerian artistes?\n\nI want them to understand that music is a tool, they should use it for positive messages. They should use it for messages that will affect the youth positively like the way it used to be. Put the right lyrics that will be of positive influence to society. Music is a big tool. There are some things you can do with it, so we should be careful how we use it.\n\nBut sometimes they need to entertain too\u2026\n\nBut you can\u2019t overdo it. If you do it too many times then it becomes a part of you. If you do it like, now you want to entertain, and then you go back to consciousness, that\u2019s good. You can\u2019t just be on a mad train nonstop.\n\nIs there any misconception about you that you really need to correct?\n\nYou know what they do, they use the media against you when you are a target for them. They spent all the money they\u2019re supposed to use to develop and help their people to pay the media to write bad about you.\n\nWho do you think is behind all these specifically?\n\nI don\u2019t know the people and I don\u2019t know what their aim is. Now, this is the third Instagram page I\u2019m on. They\u2019re trying to silence me, they\u2019re trying to cancel me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to make you understand. I had the first one (Instagram page), it went up to about 17,000 followers, they hacked it and took it off because I had some truth there. So many truths I spoke there that people would like to read and also see my artistic growth; how I started and how I\u2019m doing now, which would have been a whole long library. I started another one again and it had like 30,000 followers, they took it down again. And now, I\u2019ve opened a new one called, The Real Blackface Naija.\n\nWhat do you feel these people stand to gain? What\u2019s their motive?\n\nThey want to propagate a lie, they know I would come with the truth. They want to propagate a false agenda, they know I\u2019ll tell my people the equation. I\u2019m their major problem because they are agents of the dark.\n\nBut we\u2019re all human beings, you feel these words, these things they say\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t really care what they say. I\u2019m just waiting for them to have a one-on-one encounter with me before they can have a change of heart. The first thing they should know is that the song, African Queen, it was me that wrote it and told 2Face to sing it.\n\nYou mean African Queen wasn\u2019t written together with anyone?\n\nIt was not written together with anyone. It was me that wrote it, even though it was like the two of us should do it, I was already doing it. You understand what I mean? I was already doing the song. Like, dem give two of una assignment but you don already dey do the assignment. All that was left was to do a presentation. It\u2019s me that told him to record the song. If I didn\u2019t ask him to record the song, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use the song. I didn\u2019t hate him. I\u2019ve already listened to his album before I said, \u2018you know, this album, this is the way it sounds like, but this is the song that will make your album go to the next level\u2019. So, nobody should be thinking, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m hating on 2Face\u2019. No, 2Face is my town brother. All I did was say, \u2018you can sing this song\u2019. And they were wrong in the sense that they didn\u2019t put my name on it. I don\u2019t hate him.\n\nThere\u2019s this rumour that things are not the way they were in the past for you, that you\u2019re not doing well. I\u2019d like you to speak on that.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s a standard that they have in their heads of how they expect me to be. Maybe they want to see me with posh cars, they want to see me living in Lekki or Banana Island, they want to see me like a superstar that they know I am. But how\u2019s that going to happen when all these people are cutting me off? They know what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019m trying to keep my head above the water. With time, they\u2019ll see me in some light. I don\u2019t have to worry about standards and I\u2019m just living my life. They shouldn\u2019t worry, with time they\u2019ll see me in a Rolls Royce. And then I will be able to reach out to my people in Benue State and do some foundation things.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most memorable moment in your career?\n\nThat\u2019ll be the first time I went to Makurdi, I went to my secondary school, Mount Saint Gabriel\u2019s. The students knew me and were so excited and didn\u2019t want me to leave the school. That day was also a show. On arriving at the venue, the stadium; when the people saw me, it was like Nigeria scored a goal. It was so awesome. And when I was on the stage singing they applauded, I was having that feeling like \u2018wow, these guys are really feeling my music for them to respond to my rhymes\u2019. That was around 2008.\n\nYour song, Hard Life was widely played during the EndSars protest. How did it make you feel?\n\nI didn\u2019t worry much. I already knew the impact of the song and I already knew the reason why I made the song in 2003. And the song is crying to the government that \u2018please, we need a change. We need something positive to happen for the people\u2019 because life in Nigeria was too hard in 2003. And imagine how many years it took before they were able to recognize it.\n\nBecause in the long run, even when they play the song they don\u2019t want the artiste there. The radio will not play the song. That was supposed to be song of the year when it was released in 2004, and Ghetto Child was supposed to be the album of the year. But they didn\u2019t give me any award. Since I\u2019ve been doing music, I\u2019ve not had any award from the music industry. I want you to understand how the politics in the industry plays out. We are the ones that\u2019ll be talking about so many things the government should do better for the people. But in the long run, when they wanted to go on a protest, what did they do? They took people that are not even social crusaders, people that their music are talking about \u2018Yahoo Yahoo\u2019. Those are the people they\u2019re pushing forward to talk to the people. What are they going to tell the people? What idea do you think they have? We are the ones that\u2019ll be fighting for the people but they don\u2019t want us to be heard. But all of a sudden they\u2019re trying to use that music to propagate their own agenda. It was funny to me.\n\nHave you received your share of the royalties from the song, African Queen? There was a time you guys went to court over the issue. Has it been resolved?\n\nLet me give you an overview of African Queen. African Queen has so many covers by different artistes. I\u2019ve been on the calm side taking things easy. So many people have used African Queen in different television programmes and commercials, of which legally, I\u2019m supposed to know. But now, so many people have laid claims to the music like they own it. Meanwhile, they don\u2019t own the music. Some of these people are outside the country. So, this issue goes beyond 2Face himself. We are getting to the bottom of it. When everything has been worked out, I\u2019ll give a press statement and people will have a clear picture of where we are right now. I can\u2019t tell you too much because these are supposed to be for the lawyers.\n\nBut 2Face particularly didn\u2019t list you on the song\u2019s credits, I think?\n\nYes, but when I told his team to credit me they said they were going to do it, which they didn\u2019t do. But later, I was able to get confirmation from him that I wrote the song, and we shared the rights to his version that was released and published by Kennis Music. We shared the proceeds 50/50 percent. Since then, it is known internationally that the African Queen version that was performed by 2Face Idibia, we have a 50/50 percent cut from it. So, that has been sorted out. All that\u2019s left is for us to talk about backdated royalties.\n\nThere was a time you had issues with your former bandmates for performing some of Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs. Has that been sorted out too?\n\nPlantashun Boiz is a brand and I don\u2019t want anybody tampering with the brand name. If Faze wants to perform, let him go out and perform as Faze. If 2Face wants to perform, let him go out and perform as 2Face. Unless I tell them I\u2019m not going to be available, then both of them can perform Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs.\n\nThey may have their own shows and could decide to do a throwback on fans\u2019 request.\n\nThis particular band is restricted from doing that, because they might collect money for the band and collect for themselves as well. If I\u2019m on tour and the fans say they want Plantashun Boiz\u2019 songs, most definitely, I must get my former bandmates to come in. If I can\u2019t get them to come in, sorry I can\u2019t represent the music in a half way.\n\nAny plan of Plantashun Boiz getting back together to make music?\n\nThe Plantashun Boiz is independent of Blackface Naija, Faze and 2Face. Regardless of these people, the name Plantashun Boiz is going to be in existence. The band is going to be releasing music for the fans.\n\nPersonally, I want to see the former members make new records together.\n\nLike I always say, the first cut is the deepest. The first impression is what\u2019s really holding everybody back. But the thing is, everybody is subject to exploring their talent. These individuals (2Face and Faze) have decided to explore their talents, who am I to stop them? I\u2019m getting some young boys, R&B singers to be the new faces of Plantashun Boiz. It doesn\u2019t have to be the original members all the time.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with your former bandmates?\n\nEverybody is still where they are. I just released my new single, Mathematics, they\u2019ve not called to congratulate me. I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re caught up in their own music, I wish them all the best.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship status?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m married to my music.\n\nI mean is there anybody in your life?\n\nEven, if I have somebody in my life, I don\u2019t want to tell you people. The last person in my life, they did everything to try to spoil it. I don\u2019t want anybody to know about this one.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022Says crisis-ridden party back to life\n\n\u2022Dates for congresses at all levels ratified\n\nDeji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has granted another six months tenure extension to the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe President gave the approval yesterday morning after a closed-door meeting with members of the Committee at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSources said the Buni-led committee requested for another six months tenure extension after doing 12 months, to enable them \u201cput the party in very good shape and conduct a seamless elective National Convention.\u201d\n\nThe Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Buni presented a summary of the Committee\u2019s progress report to the President at the meeting.\n\nThe Chairman was accompanied to the meeting with the President by other members of the committee \u2013 Governor Isiaka Oyetola of Osun State, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, Ken Nnamani, Abubakar Yusuf, Akinyemi Olaide, Mrs. Stella Oketete, Dr. James Lulu, Chief David Lyon, Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed and the committee\u2019s Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, in a statement after the meeting, said the President approved the tenure extension after a detailed consideration of the progress report, the schedule of outstanding activities with regards to congresses, the National Convention and the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship election.\n\nHe said by virtue of the extension, the tenure of the caretaker committees at each level from wards, local governments, states and national, would end immediately elections were held at their respective levels with officers immediately take oath of office, terminating with the National Convention.\n\nThe secretary recalled that at its last meeting, the National Executive Committee (NEC) conferred on the Committee, the power of the National Convention, \u201cwhich is in line with powers provided in Article 13.3 of the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated: \u201cPresident Buhari on Friday approved the review of the timelines available to the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\n\u201cThe President also approved the timetable for APC Ward, Local Government and State Congresses. Ward Congresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by Local Government Congresses on 14th August, 2021 and State Congresses on 18th September, 2021.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe noted that Buni informed the President that the Committee had during the period under review, led the party to contest in several elections and bye-elections, with an overall success rate of 95 per cent.\n\nOn the peace and reconciliation efforts, he said the Chairman informed the President that the committee commenced its assignment with the desire to foster genuine reconciliation on solid foundation, by giving all issues and every aggrieved member fair hearing and objectively placing party interests above individual interests.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to state that the party is now more peaceful, more accommodating, and more united with greater prospects than when we came on board,\u201d Akpanudoedehe quoted Buni as telling Buhari.\n\nOn the Anambra governorship election, the secretary stressed that the chairman notified the President that 14 aspirants indicated interest to contest the election through purchase of expression of interest and nomination forms, and that all of them had been cleared by the Screening Committee as eligible to contest.\n\nHe added: \u201cAmong other achievements in the CECPC\u2019s administration of the party, the National Chairman informed the President that \u201cthe CECPC inherited liability of unpaid legal fee to the tune of N340 million, but successfully negotiated and brought down the fees to N179 million which is now fully paid.\u201d\n\nThe secretary added that the Chairman informed the President that the Committee had been very cautious and meticulous in making arrangements to conduct credible, transparent, flawless and generally acceptable congresses and convention for the party to produce a strong leadership that will enjoy the support, trust and confidence of all members.\n\n\u201cAt all times, we have enjoyed the confidence of Mr. President and enjoyed your leadership. In developing the timetable for the congresses and convention, the support to conduct a credible election cannot be over-emphasised; this will also justify the successes recorded and the status of the new APC that we have all dreamt of,\u201d Akpanudoedehe quoted Buni as telling the President.\n\nDuring the meeting at the State House, President Buhari took a holistic look at the activities of the APC in recent times and concluded that the party, which was crisis ridden, had been revived and now fully back to life.\n\nHe, therefore, congratulated the Mala Buni-led committee for its task to return the party from a comatose state to proper reorganisation at all levels.\n\nThe President said the APC had been revived, energised and repositioned for its forthcoming national convention and future elections.\n\nAccording to him, the fortunes of the party had been brightened by the re-organisation and reconciliation of members across the party, saying \u201cwith the work done by the committee the party has bounced back to life.\n\n\u201cI have listened with great interest to the remarkable job you have done so far. We are all witnesses to the crisis that engulfed the party leading to litigations and presented a picture of selfishness and division,\u201d said the President.\n\nPresident Buhari said the party\u2019s structure was disturbed by the conflicts that preceded and followed various elections, noting that the secretariat had been witnessing a beehive of peaceful activities after the reconciliation.\n\nThe President said: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that with the coming of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and its effective management of the affairs of the party and the pursuit of its mandate, the party has bounced back to life and the National Secretariat of our party has once again become a beehive of activities, as it used to be in the good old days before the crisis.\u201d\n\nThe President told members of the committee that they would continue to enjoy the support of all party stalwarts and members to complete their assignment with the actualisation of the convention and leave an \u201cindelible footprint\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cI wish to assure you that your committee will continue to enjoy my support and that of other stakeholders to ensure that the conduct and outcome of the congresses and National Convention are done in a manner that conforms with our desire to leave indelible footprints of all-round development and a lasting legacy for future generations.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of APC Caretaker Committee said they approached their duty with commitment and dedication to rescue the party from imminent collapse.\n\nThe Yobe State Governor noted that all issues and members were given a fair hearing, and an open-door policy was created to accommodate all those that were aggrieved, leading to withdrawal of cases in court and peaceful settlements.\n\n\u201cWe are currently witnessing high powered decamping to our party, including governors from the PDP. The party is now more peaceful, orderly and accommodating than what we met on the ground. Although there was initial fear, the mobilisation and sensitisation was able to allay the fears of members,\u201d Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said the registration and revalidation of members across the country recorded more than 40 million members, and an appeal committee was also set up to hear all matters related to the process so that no member gets disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that youth and women constitute huge population of the voting group. We had a youth and women committee, and also people with disability,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, a Contact and Strategy Team had been set up in every state to come up with an acceptable template that would ensure transparency, credibility and acceptability of the internal electoral processes.\n\nBuni also said the committee had instituted a process to review the party\u2019s constitution and look into loopholes that usually fan conflict and litigations among members, with more than 500 memoranda already received.\n\nHe told the President and other party members that 14 party members had indicated their interest to contest for the Anambra State elections, assuring that the primary elections will be free, fair and transparent.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said huge legal fees were inherited, and the committee had worked with members to settle all the outstanding, after scaling them down, noting that payment for the APC National Secretariat had been completed.\n\n\u201cThe party members have agreed to name the secretariat, Muhammadu Buhari House,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile thanking the President for his support and insight, Buni noted that a National Conference for the Youths was organised recently as part of the bottom-up approach to strengthening the party and ensuring relevance of all stakeholders.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria will continue frontline advocacy for a just transition to zero emissions\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo is worried about the global clamour for green energy and the looming reduction in funding for gas and fossil fuel projects, especially in developing countries, by international bodies and institutions.\n\nAs a result, he summoned a virtual meeting on the subject last Thursday, with other top federal government officials in attendance; including the Ministers of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar; Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy Agba, and the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Bitrus Bako Nabasu.\n\nAt the virtual meeting, Osinbajo maintained his position that the funding for gas and fossil fuel projects in Nigeria and other developing countries be sustained during the global transition to net-zero emissions and said Nigeria would continue its frontline advocacy for a just transition to zero-emission.\n\nHe also asserted that Nigeria would play a critical role with other gas exporting countries to stop the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects in developing countries.\n\nThe Vice President noted that it was vital that the Forum of Gas Exporting Countries (GEC) join forces to prevent the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects, especially from developing countries, by international bodies and institutions.\n\nAccording to the VP, concrete steps should be taken by the GEC Forum to stop further plans by international bodies and Western countries on defunding of gas/fossil fuel projects as it does not benefit developing countries especially.\n\nHe noted that it was vital Nigeria plays a significant role in achieving a consensus with the GEC Forum on these issues, even as the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) scheduled to hold later this year approaches.\n\nIn the same vein, the Vice President asked the Inter-ministerial committee on Climate Change, led by the Federal Ministry of Environment, to finetune Nigeria\u2019s position for COP26, while the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources would focus on strengthening the country\u2019s strategy, particularly in its initiative to use gas as a transition fuel.\n\nBoth the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and Minister of Foreign Affairs were directed to work together, to ensure the GEC Forum reaches a consensus that reflects Nigeria\u2019s advocacy on defunding of gas projects.\n\nBefore now, Osinbajo had, at different forums in the past months, raised the issue of financing of gas projects in developing countries, especially Nigeria, advocating a just transition and more effective engagements since the campaign for the net-zero emission by 2050 resumed.\n\nIn March this year, at a meeting with a delegation from the European Union (EU), led by its Executive Vice President, Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis, the VP reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the global green energy initiative, but called for a just transition to zero-emission.\n\nAt another meeting held in February with the British Member of Parliament and COP26 President-Designate, Mr. Alok Sharma, Osinbajo restated Nigeria\u2019s support and commitment to the Climate Change agreement, but cited the planned restrictions on financing of gas projects in African countries as a potential setback.\n\nAt the UN Dialogue on Food Systems, also in February, the Vice President stressed the need for the international community to consider, as an option, the use of gas and other more environmentally friendly fuel sources, as against what he termed \u201cdefunding gas projects\u201d based on gas not being environmentally friendly enough.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Charles Ajunwa in Lagos and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Kaduna State office of the Department of State Services, DSS, yesterday invited and questioned controversial cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, over his recent allegations, during an interview on Arise Television that some security agents were aiding and benefiting from bandits ravaging communities in the North.\n\nAt the DSS office, sources close to Gumi said he was questioned on his statement during the interview, \u201cand the cleric clarified his declaration, saying he did not accuse the entire military and other security agencies of aiding bandits but \u201cthe bad eggs in the security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe sources said the cleric was subsequently cautioned on his utterances by the DSS detectives and allowed to go home.\n\nSpokesman of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, confirmed the invitation of Gumi by the service, adding, \u201cIt may not be unconnected with his claim that security agencies were colluding with bandits in the spate of kidnapping for ransom afflicting the nation.\u201d\n\nAfunanya said further: \u201cGumi was invited as a person of interest. The service invited Sheikh Gumi. It is not out of place for it to invite any person of interest.\u201d\n\nDuring the Arise TV interview last Wednesday, the cleric, who is known to have access to the bandits, said: \u201cThese bandits, if you don\u2019t know, are cooperating with a lot of bad elements in our security system. This is a business. So many people are involved, you\u2019ll be so surprised.\n\n\u201cThey were caught in Zamfara; they were caught everywhere, how do these big weapons cross our borders? How can these big weapons cross our borders and get into the forest without the cooperation of some bad element of the security operatives assisting them? It\u2019s not possible. If I give you the same amount of guns, can you take them to the UK? You can\u2019t because the security is alert.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army kicked against the cleric\u2019s claims and warned that it would not condone acts sabotaging its efforts.\n\nOnyema Nwachukwu, the Army\u2019s spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is essential to remind ourselves that this same military, being accused of connivance, are the ones who recently put their lives on the line to rescue abductees of the Government Secondary School, Birnin Yauri, from kidnappers.\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian Army will not attempt to excuse the possibility of black sheep amongst its fold, it must be stated unambiguously that it will not condone any form of sabotage or aiding and assisting the enemy by any personnel.\u201d\n\nAlso, Gumi\u2019s spokesman, Tukur Mamu, in an interview with the VOA yesterday, dismissed the allegation against Gumi, saying there was nowhere in the TV interview when the cleric categorically accused the entire military of aiding bandits.\n\nThe spokesman explained that what Gumi said was \u201cwhat people have been saying and even the soldiers have been saying is that there could be some bad eggs among them.\u201d\n\nGumi: I was Never Quizzed By DSS\n\nBut the Kaduna-based cleric yesterday evening debunked reports that he was either quizzed or invited for questioning by the DSS over his remarks on security agencies.\n\nSpeaking after presiding over a Jummat service at the Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna State, Sheikh Gumi said all his interventions with bandits inside the forest were done in collaboration with the support of the government and security agencies, hence he did not commit any offence.\n\n\u201cNobody Invited me for questioning or any arrest, I can say that categorically,\u201d the Sheik said, adding, \u201csince I ventured into the forest, I went there with full security, the police, with the knowledge of the DSS, traditional rulers and the Fulani leaders, I never went alone\u201d.\n\nHe also insisted that he never made any disparaging remarks against the military during his recent live interview on national television.\n\nAccording to him, there was nowhere in the TV interview that he categorically accused the entire military.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has unveiled plans for the Benin City Cultural District, which will house the Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nObaseki disclosed this at the 2021 National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) Retreat for management staff and curators held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor said an international town planning group is in the state undertaking Urban and Regional planning of Edo, which will redesign Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we have included the carving out of a large area as a Cultural District and the Museum will be located in the Cultural District. If we host 5,000 visitors every year as a result of the attraction to the Museum, the state will benefit from it.\n\nWe are already working on this and have put up an Urban renewal plan for this purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEMOWAA will be part of the national museum complex and the home for the comprehensive display of the Benin Art collection across the world. The artworks are global works and represent Africa, Nigeria and Edo globally; we should not lose them. We insist on the return of these artifacts to their original home, Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe should build something that is iconic and represents the extent of the prowess of the Benin empire. EMOWAA must be a research institution as there is a lot more to research and find out about the Benin Empire. There will be several important buildings in the museum complex and the museum will be a complex that will deal with the different aspects of the cultural life of Edo people.\u201d\n\nObaseki said culture is one of the viable platforms to leapfrog the state\u2019s development moving into the future, noting, \u201cCulture is a plank for the regeneration of our people.\n\n\u201cThe state government in collaboration with the Federal Government and the Royal Palace are in conversation on the return of the Benin artifacts sited in museums and collections across the world.\u201d\n\nObaseki thanked the British Government and the British Museum for alerting that there might be more works to be retrieved and also for the grant provided to undertake archaeological surveys and research to find the works that currently exist in Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI assure you that by working with other European Governments, we have reached an advanced stage in getting the resources to start the first phase of preparing for the return and acceptance of these works. We are going to commence the construction of the pavilion where the returned works will be stored in the city center.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA), which is a complex and will be made up of several pieces will include the pavilion, the National Museum, Royal collections, Urhokpota Hall, restoration of a part of the Benin Moat, all of which will make visitors have the full experience of the Benin culture that span for more than six to seven centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is a training point for us as a state as we build a museum where the world will come and see original pieces which used to adorn European museums. This is a great project, which we look forward to.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended the creation of the Digital Benin project, which is a project documenting all works taken out of this city in every private or public museum globally.\n\nThe Director General of NCMM, Prof. Abba Isa Tijani, commended the governor for his love, determination, courage and commitment in ensuring the return of the artifacts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have 52 museums across the country and 65 monuments and sites. The issue of training and retraining is really a big problem for us in the commission.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over, I said the best way is to partner with the private sector and our partners outside the country. They have been able to now come to our aid in terms of capacity building.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) is a big opportunity for us to be at the forefront of promoting and establishing this museum. We have curators who are experienced; they just need slight training at the international level so that the standard that we want to set up at the EMOWAA will be maintained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Thursday launched the online Portal for the continuous voters registration exercise nationwide.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the disclosure at the national headquarters of the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the register of voters is at the heart of democratic elections, stating that \u201ca good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. For this reason, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIn exercising its powers under the law, the Commission undertook a fresh registration of eligible voters with every General Election until 2011 when the first reliable biometric register of voters was compiled. Thereafter, the Commission embarked on intermittent registration of voters on the eve of major elections. However, in April 2017, this Commission for the first time began the implementation of registration of voters on a continuous basis as provided in the Electoral Act. As a result, 14,283,734 new voters were added to the register by the time the process was suspended in August, 2018 in order to prepare for the 2019 General Election\u201d.\n\nThe chairman also said that, Monday 28th June 2021 remains sacrosanct, as the registration of voters will commence in full nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED). This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM)\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that in the Commission\u2019s determination to serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) online. We hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience.\n\nThe exercise according to the Commission will be carried out continuously over a period of at least one year thereby, providing enough time for the Commission to reach all the nooks and crannies of the country. \u201cNo eligible Nigerian will be disenfranchised, the chairman noted.\n\nThe chairman also allayed the fears expressed by some Nigerians that many citizens may be disenfranchised by the new digital arrangement pointing out that, the Commission is aware that not all Nigerians have computers, smart phones, access to the internet or residing in urban and sub-urban areas. Some citizens may also have one form of disability or another to make it impossible for them to register online.\n\nThe Commission, Yakubu said is also aware of its responsibility under the law to provide every eligible Nigerian the opportunity to register irrespective of where they live or other circumstances of life. \u201cI wish to assure you that in addition to the online registration portal, there will be some 2,673 centres where citizens can register physically nationwide\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

I tried to give them a way to pass but when they were overtaking me, I noticed that it was not a military truck but Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI was scared, so I decided to make a u-turn. When they moved ahead and then suddenly turned and started following us, so I had to stop the vehicle and told my passengers that we were under attack by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWe ran into the bush, as we noticed three more trucks of Boko Haram coming. It was scary. They did not fire at us, but we had to keep running. We later returned to the highway and a payloader gave us a lift to Auno where we informed the police RRS who moved in toward their direction.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PREMIUM TIMES on phone, the RRS Commander, Mr Babalola, said, \u201cwe only did what we are mandated to do which is protecting commuters along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway.\n\n\u201cIt happened at Garin Kuturu, some few kilometres before Auno, and when we responded to the quick intel shared with us by the locals. But before we reached the spot we noticed that they had fired \u2026 and they hit a patrol vehicle of the counter-terrorist squad. So we moved in and we saw that they were rounding up passengers.\n\n\u201cWe engaged them while releasing tear-gas that blinded them.

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor/ Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has declared that the current sufferings visited on Nigerians will make them to chase the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government out of power in 2023.\n\nThe governor made the assertion during the inauguration of Pabod Breweries By-Pass Road and Oginigba \u2013 Ordinance link road at Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Port Harcourt on Friday, which was performed by the former Nigeria\u2019s Senate President, Senator Iyorchia Ayu.\n\nWike noted that APC rode on social media propaganda that sounded so convincing at the time, but had since demonstrated how clueless they are in matters of governance.\n\nAccording to Wike, there is no amount of intimidation and threat that will make Nigerians to be deceived again, because they cannot afford to allow the sufferings to continue.\n\nHe said \u201cNigeria needs prayers to come out from this situation we find ourselves. Not that we wanted it so, but we gave a government, a party, that was not prepared to govern a chance. A party that came through propaganda, social media, lies; now we have seen what we have caused ourselves.\n\n\u201cThat was why you voted for them in 2015. Now look at the level of suffering, Look at how all of us are feeling today. Will you allow them use the social media to deceive us? The same people who used the social media are no longer happy with the social media.\u201d\n\nWike restated that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) remains the only hope of Nigeria to lead it out of the current woes.\n\nHe stated that Nigerians cannot afford to allow the mistakes of 2015 to repeat itself. According to him, another erroneous attempt to entrust APC with the responsibility of governance, will be disastrous for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe only hope Nigerians have is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). If Nigerians make the mistake again and allow these (APC) people in 2023, then you have dug your graves.\n\n\u201cI will not be a party to it. If you don\u2019t want to dig your grave, then make sure that by 2023 you chase them out.\u201d\n\nWike warned trailer trucks drivers against converting the just reconstructed road to a park as the State government will not hesitate to impound their trailers.\n\nSpeaking further, Wike said the Oginigba-Slaughter market located at the Trans-Amadi industrial layout cannot be allowed to operate without proper adherence to established rules.",

Kennedy Airport as he prepared to fly to Nigeria by way of Amsterdam, federal authorities said.\n\nHe was charged after allegedly stealing over $350,000 in jobless benefits from the Washington state Employment Security Department in 2020.\n\nHe was also accused of trying to defraud the Internal Revenue Service of nearly $1.6 million, authorities said.\n\nA federal judge in New York in May ruled that Rufai could be released before trial on a $300,000 \u201csurety\u201d bond, but delayed the release to let federal prosecutors appeal.\n\nIn his decision Friday, Settle found that the \u201cdefendant poses a serious risk of nonappearance.\u201d\n\nTacoma attorney Lance Hester, one of Rufai\u2019s lawyers, said Rufai could ask the court to reconsider Friday\u2019s ruling if there were changes in his circumstances.\n\nFederal officials have called Rufai the first \u201csignificant\u201d arrest related to Washington\u2019s fraud.\n\nWashington state was severely victimized by fraudulent claims for pandemic-related benefits.\n\nIt likely paid out more than $647 million in such fraudulent claims, though $370 million was recovered, according to state officials.\n\nAnother lawyer for Rufai, Michael C. Barrows, has said his client \u201cdenies any involvement in these transactions.\u201d\n\nThe case has shed light on how criminals were able to file bogus unemployment claims in dozens of states.\n\nRufai allegedly employed a feature of Gmail, Google\u2019s free email service, that let him use a single email account to file multiple unemployment claims in Washington and elsewhere using stolen Social Security numbers and other personal data.\n\nThat same technique was allegedly used by Chukwuemeka Onyegbula, a 38-year-old IT engineer at a Nigerian oil company, Pan Ocean Oil Corporation to steal roughly $290,000 in unemployment insurance benefits from Washington and other states.\n\nHe also stole around $53,000 in federal disaster loans, according to an indictment returned Wednesday in federal district court in Tacoma.\n\nProsecutors have not suggested a link between the two men. Court documents have not listed an attorney who might comment on Onyegbula\u2019s behalf.",

          "text": "\u2026Farmers unable to go to farms due to banditry \u2013 el-Rufa\u2019i \u2026Food calamity looms unless\u2026- CAN \u202612.83m citizens in crisis levels \u2013 FOA, ActionAid \u2026We\u2019re finding it difficult to cope \u2013 Nigerians \u2026Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re combing bandits\u2019 hideouts \u2013 Military\n\nThe increasing security concerns in Nigeria especially in the North have made it difficult for farmers to go to their farms as they fear being attacked and have consequently fled their communities. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\nNigeria is currently facing security challenges in different areas; from the North-east that is ravaged by Boko Haram/Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), the North-west distressed by armed bandits, the South-east disturbed by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) secession group, and the North-central which is battling the age-long farmers,\u2019 herders\u2019 crises.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s alarm\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i of Kaduna state recently said there is a looming food crisis as farmers are unable to go to their farms due to the activities of bandits.\n\nThe governor, who emphasised the role of the Department of State Services (DSS) in providing reliable information needed by the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of the insurgents, said, \u201cthere is urgent need by security agencies to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of the criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the criminal gangs terrorising the North-west region have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015, after the joint operation of the states stopped.\n\n\u201cAs Directors of the State Commands of the DSS in the North-west, you are all aware of the immense security challenges across the states in our region. The consequences of these serious security deficits have devastated the rural economy, taken lives and property and made simple travel an ordeal across federal, state and local roads.\n\n\u201cThe governors of the North-west states and Niger state appreciated this salient fact as far back as 2015. We came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state. These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThat the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms; that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nCAN\u2019s concerns\n\nSimilarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (Northern CAN), has noted that without mincing words, the current state of the nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its the public relations officer (PRO), Rev. Jechonia Albert, to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAccording to the statement, due to the prevailing economic and security challenges facing Nigerians, celebrating June 12 as a Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace; hence not worthy of celebration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cJune 12, declared as Democracy Day by the current administration, was marked with mixed feelings across the country. Amid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially the in rural communities, have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided and people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians. The rains are here, but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is a looming food crisis and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, we may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarms\n\nIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country. It, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFAO country representative Fred Kafero, who spoke at the 44th meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD), said the theme of the meeting, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Agriculture and Food Security in the Face of Covid-19, Floods and Insecurity,\u2019 was a call to action, to cushion threats to the livelihoods of a large section of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the March-April 2021 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) food security analysis conducted in 16 states and the FCT projected that a total of 12.83 million people in the affected states would be in crisis levels.\n\nAlso, the ActionAid country director Ene Obi raised concerns over the inability of women to go to farms for fear of being raped. She said being the major producers of food in the country, it is important for the government to fast-track its efforts at curtailing the rising insecurity.\n\nShe decried low budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector despite the fact that Nigeria is a signatory to the Maputo Declaration on the allocation of a minimum of 10 per cent to the sector.\n\nNigerians\u2019 lamentations\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians who spoke with Blueprint Weekend have lamented the increase in prices of foodstuff. The high increase in the prices of food items has affected so many families as well as salary earners. Some of the civil servants who spoke with our reporter said they now find it difficult to cope with the skyrocketing increase in the prices of essential commodities.\n\nA civil servant told this reporter in confidence that, \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Ministry of Labour and receive salary, but at the end of the month, I pay debts because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a mudu of beans? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying; it keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kabiru Abdullahi, a meat seller, blamed the increase in meat in the market on the rise of insecurity in some parts of the country, pointing out that a kilo of meat sold for 1, 500 three months ago is now 2, 500 to 3, 000 depending on the bargaining power of the customer.\n\n\u201cAnytime we go to the market, we come back with whatever we can afford. A cow that we used to buy for N300, 000 is now N600, 000, while that of 250,000 is now N500, 000 or even N450, 000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commodities are not scarce, but the problem is going to the market to get them due to the security situation in some parts of the country. We can\u2019t go to states like Katsina and Sokoto where cows are cheap; we now source them Kano, Bauchi or Gombe state,\u201d he said.\n\nIsa Mohamed, a farmer from Anzare village in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state whose village was sacked by bandits in February, described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the soaring prices of foodstuff and lamented that they have been unable to farm grains due to the activities of bandits.\n\nA pepper trader, who identified herself as Bilkisu, said: \u201cThe cost of food is very expensive, especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4, 000, but now, it is N18, 000 or N17, 000. I can\u2019t afford a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy the items in smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6, 500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13, 000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy in bits from other traders.\n\nMilitary\u2019s assurances\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters said it had begun the bombardment of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the North-west, North-central and some parts of the North-east. It stated that operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in various theatres of operations have led to the reduction in criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe director, Defence Media Operation (DMO), Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, stated this recently while briefing journalists on the operational activities of the AFN across the country between June 3 and 16, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cTroop\u2019s operational activities in Operation Hadarin Daji theatre of operation between June 3 and 16, 2021, were characterised with ambush operations, aggressive fighting patrols, air raids, sustained air intelligence surveillance reconnaissance patrols as well as cordon and search operations.\n\n\u201cThese operations yielded attendant successes in the period under review. Troops, during an ambush operation on June 3, intercepted and neutralised some gunrunners who were in possession of assorted arms and ammunition between Naimaimai Village and Sabon Birni Town in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on June 4, 2021, troops, following credible intelligence report, conducted cordon and search operation along Gurbin Baure \u2013 Jibia Road in Katsina state. During the operation, troops intercepted and neutralised some armed bandits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s stern order\n\nThe senior special assistant on media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC in March, said President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a crackdown on bandits terrorising farmers across the country.\n\nAlso, during his interview with Arise Television recently, the president said he had ordered security agents to shoot on sight bandits carrying AK-47 rifles.\n\nFood imports\n\nThe rise in agricultural imports has continued unabated due to insecurity despite many Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) initiatives aimed at achieving food sufficiency.\n\nA recent foreign trade report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that Nigeria\u2019s agricultural imports increased by 140 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNigeria imported agricultural items worth N630.18 billion in the period compared to N262.1 billion in first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis represents the highest quarterly agric import recorded by Nigeria since 2016. In the past two years, between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, Nigeria has spent N3.1 trillion on agricultural imports.\n\nSome of the programmes, as stated by the apex bank in its last MPC briefing, include N631.4 billion to 3.11 million small-holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 program. Also, 29, 26 beneficiaries received N111.7 billion for the AGSMEIS, while 548,345 beneficiaries have received N253.4 billion under the Targeted Credit Facility.\n\nThese interventions notwithstanding, agric imports have continued to rise, triggered by multiple de-valuations of the naira; demand for higher input raw materials, and rising inflation. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food consumption still relies significantly on the importation of food items to stimulate local production.\n\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. It was N252 billion in the 4th quarter of 2020, translating to an annualised cost of N1 trillion ($2 billion). The country\u2019s food index has increased by 32.3 percent between September 2019 and April 2021 which is only a weighted aggregate of the market reality.\n\nAccording to a market survey report which studies the prices of food items in major markets in Lagos state, a bag of pepper surged by as much as 85.7 per cent in May 2021, while beans increased by 15.1 per cent in the same period. Other items that have witnessed significant increases recently include flour, egg, tomatoes, noodles, pasta, bread, beverages, just to state a few.\n\nFor Suleiman Dikwa, the CEO of Green Sahara Farms, a major cause of the surge in agric imports is the inability of the country to produce sufficiently for local consumption",

          "title": "How Education Was Suspended In Nigeria During A COVID-19 Lockdown",
          "text": "Solomon Elusoji\n\nKemi Ogunsanya, 29, studied English Education at the University of Lagos. After graduation she wasn\u2019t inclined, at first, to teach. But after several failed job applications, she returned to the classroom, this time as an instructor. And, for seven years, she hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nWhen Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Education ordered the closure of all schools to limit the spread of the pandemic in March 2020, Kemi\u2019s students \u2013 aged seven to 11 \u2013 were just about to commence examinations. \u201cIt was a bit destabilising,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we knew we were going to continue online.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s school made the transition to online learning using tools such as Zoom and Class Dojo. To \u201cthoroughly engage\u201d her students, she picked up skills in cartoon animation and visual design, and researched techniques on how to gamify learning. \u201cI wanted to captivate my students\u2019 attention,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that if it was boring, students would not enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOf course there were challenges \u2013 the regular limitations of Internet data and power supply. And since online learning requires a lot of parent participation, she had to keep constant tabs on parents to ensure student attendance and prompt submission of class assignments.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of effort, but it wasn\u2019t a wasted year,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cNow that schools have resumed, there are some slides and videos I created then that we are still using now. And the students still enjoy them.\u201d\n\nBut for millions of students enrolled in public or rural schools in Nigeria, the school closures halted formal learning, according to more than a dozen teachers who spoke to Channels Television. For months, students were cut off from their instructors. The use of digital technology to communicate was not an option as most children who attend public, rural schools come from poor homes with no access to smartphones or the Internet. The Ministry of Education in several states tried to reach students through mass produced radio and television programs, but the impact was minimal at best. \u201cTeaching did not stop,\u201d one teacher said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t tell if learning took place.\u201d\n\nAn unfair advantage\n\nAdaobi Amadi, 34, had always wanted to be a teacher. When she was younger, she had her own make-shift school, complete with a blackboard and chalk, where she taught her neighbours. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when she took up teaching after graduating from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Akwa, with a degree in Applied Biochemistry.\n\nToday, she teaches Chemistry to students between 13 and 18 at a public school in Port Harcourt.\n\nWhen schools were closed in March 2020, she thought, at first, it was going to be a one-month holiday. But the months continued to meld into one another and she began to feel an emotion she described as \u2018panic\u2019. While her son, who attends a private school, was receiving lectures online from home, she was cut off from her students. \u201cAt that point, it became kind of stressful,\u201d she said.\n\nAn online learning approach would never work for Adaobi\u2019s students. Most of them came from families with no access to smartphones or laptops, talk less of Internet data. \u201cIn my school, there are students who come to me and say, we haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday. Majority of them are domestic workers. We do have a sprinkling who come from middle-class homes, but those are very few.\u201d\n\nWhen schools began to reopen in the later part of 2020, Adaobi said \u201cthe drop in performance was glaring.\u201d Teachers tried to review what had been taught in the past months and holidays were shrunk. The Christmas break didn\u2019t extend much beyond a week, as efforts to gain ground intensified.\n\nAdaobi said school hours were also reduced from six to three hours as authorities moved to comply with social distancing regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cPrivate schools have maintained their schooling schedules,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get like six hours of schooling. And my students get only three hours. And it\u2019s the same syllable they are supposed to cover and the same examinations they are supposed to sit for.\u201d\n\nShe observed that the questions in the last set of external exams her student wrote seemed to have been easier than previous ones. Perhaps, she mused, the examination bodies had considered the impact of the pandemic on student performance. (A WAEC spokesman told Channels Television the examination body \u201cwill never compromise on standards or integrity\u201d of its tests)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that will happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams. Private school students not only got the online classes that they did, then when schools resumed they continued with their normal schedule. So they are prepared. But public school students are not.\u201d\n\nAn inadequate government response\n\nNigeria is not the only country where the pandemic disrupted education. According to UNICEF, about 1.2 billion learners were out of school and 73.8% of the world\u2019s school population were affected by school closures as a result of efforts to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nOn paper, the Federal Government developed several initiatives to ensure students continued to learn despite the pandemic lockdowns, through the Nigeria Education Sector COVID-19 Response Strategy set up by the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).\n\nThe strategy included plans for the Learn at Home Programme (LHP), which led to partnerships with educational technology companies and the launching of virtual e-learning platforms.\n\nThese platforms include SchoolGate (for primary school students), Mobile Classroom, WAEC E-learning toolkit and Unity Schools virtual learning platforms.\n\nThe Ministry, on its website, also linked to other educational resources from Khan Academy, Seesaw, National Open University, UNESCO School Meets Learner Approach, Teacher Development Programme, British Council, and others.\n\nState Governments, too, adopted several initiatives. The Lagos State government, for example, partnered with First Bank of Nigeria to equip students with e-learning solutions and low-end devices preloaded with a government-accredited curriculum and designed to work offline.\n\nAlso, many states turned to broadcasting lessons on radio and television. These lessons encompassed content on core primary and secondary school subjects.\n\nBut what was the impact of these interventions? Were they able to meet the learning needs of students or mitigate the number of dropouts when schools eventually reopened, considering Nigeria has one of the largest numbers of out-of-school-children in the world?\n\nA Federal Ministry of Education spokesman Ben Bem Goong suggested that it was hardly the Ministry\u2019s responsibility to ensure active participation in digital learning.\n\n\u201cHaving access to online facilities is basically an individual responsibility,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t buy a phone and give it to anybody. I don\u2019t think the Ministry will buy phones and laptops (for students) to access online materials. We haven\u2019t gotten to that level.\u201d\n\nOne vision of the Ministry of Education is \u201cto provide universal and equal access to quality basic and secondary education that will ensure self-reliance, preparedness for further education, good citizenship and effective participation in democratic governance.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the Ministry was worried about the inability of many students, especially those attending public, rural schools, to access digital learning, including resources provided by the government, Mr Goong said the government cannot be expected to do everything.\n\n\u201cThe question you are asking me is not within the (purview) of the Federal Ministry of Education to answer, in the sense that providing Internet facilities is not just a function of what the Ministry of Education does alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn terms of providing electricity \u2013 which is the key driver to rolling out online materials \u2013 it\u2019s not within our responsibility to do. This cuts across sectors. So when a student is unable to access online materials that are driven by electricity or wireless signals, it is not entirely a responsibility of the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cIt is a responsibility that cuts across Ministries, one that also has to do with the family. There is no way government can do all of that alone; if government has built schools, government has engaged teachers, it\u2019s paying them, maintaining the schools, I think some other stakeholders should also take that responsibility, particularly those that value education; they should be able to say how do I provide laptops and batteries for my children to learn. When you begin to put everything on the head of government, believe you me, even the best critics of governance will not like to be in government after one week.\u201d\n\nTo prepare for another pandemic-like school closure, Mr Goong said the Federal Ministry of Education was seeking to partner with the Nigeria Television Authority and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria to develop lessons in key areas for broadcast, especially for students in exit classes.\n\nThe importance of digital tools\n\nSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna. He was excited to be starting his fellowship with Teach for Nigeria, a program which recruits talented future leaders and sends them to teach at schools in low-income communities.\n\nHe remembers being introduced to teachers who were invigilating a primary six examination. When he asked them how the students were doing, they appeared to mock the pupils. \u201cThese ones? They don\u2019t know anything,\u201d one of the teachers said, according to Onyeledo. \u201cIn fact, they can\u2019t even read the questions on the board. We just wrote it down in English language but we have to read it out in Hausa before they will be able to attempt it.\u201d\n\nFor most of the next two years, Onyeledo, a graduate of Geology from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, worked hard to teach a class of kids how to read.\n\n\u201cIf a child goes from primary one to primary six and still can\u2019t read,\u201d Onyeledo said, \u201c I think the school system has wasted six years of that child\u2019s life. Because a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy. Just the ability to read, to communicate in the English language.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic-induced school closures cut short Onyeledo\u2019s time with the kids.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was close to devastating, mainly because of the kids in my class,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cI had been working with them closely, trying to get them to learn to read, basically. I was teaching primary two. I started with them in primary one. That was then the pandemic happened. When schools closed, it was devastating because I knew how far we had gone. If I\u2019m not with them, they might just slide back.\u201d\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t really be with them because most of the parents of the kids in his class didn\u2019t have smartphones. The only channel of communication was through voice calls, which he said were not effective enough and couldn\u2019t really scale. There were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that level, these children need hands-on-learning, they need guidance.\u201d\n\nWhen lockdown measures were eased, he tried to visit some of his students at home and share resources with their guidance, while observing Covid protocols. But he would always wish that his students had access to technology.\n\n\u201cWith tech, we would have held online classes on Zoom, easily created a classroom, a group for all the parents and kids,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cAnd sometimes send voice notes. For those who are visual learners too, we could send some resources, including videos. It would make your teaching very effective. With technology, it would have been a whole lot better.\u201d\n\nMaryam Onubaye, 27, was another Teach for Nigeria fellow in Kaduna who lost major contact with her pupils after schools closed. But she wouldn\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about ways to get them learning,\u201d she said \u201cSome of their parents have Whatsapp-enabled phones. So I went to their houses \u2013 the community where my school was \u2013 Tudun Wada \u2013 you can have like five families in one area and ten kids. I went to their houses and made lesson videos on the subjects I teach and every week I send them to their phones. I give exercises at the end of the videos that they can do. And I explain to parents how they can guide them and make sure they actually do the exercises. And they take a picture and send it back to me. We did that every week.\n\n\u201cThe ones who do not have Whatsapp-enabled phones, I had to do weekly exercises with them. Every weekend, I\u2019ll go and teach them a little, come back and follow up.\u201d\n\nHer enthusiasm and creativity and hard work made some impact, but Onubaye recognised the limitations. More \u201cdigital tools would have made a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for that to happen, there are so many things that need to happen. The kids have to have access to the internet, power, a tablet, a phone or a computer.\u201d For now, they do not.\n\n\u2018A lot of work to do\u2019\n\nIn March, internet penetration in Nigeria stood at 41 percent, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission. And coverage is mostly limited to urban cities such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano. But almost half of all Nigerians still live in rural communities, according to data from the World Bank. In 2020, the Federal Government launched a new national broadband plan which, by 2025, is expected to ensure all tertiary education institutions are within \u201c5km of fibre manhole or with a fixed connection\u201d to the Internet. Under the plan 50 per cent of secondary schools and 25 percent are expected to be covered by 2025. Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, which \u201cworks to connect underserved young Africans with digital opportunities\u201d, said the government\u2019s plan \u201cis very conservative\u201d and \u201cmay not even be achieved if the government continues to introduce contradictory policies.\u201d\n\nAnother obvious challenge is power supply. As of 2018, according to World Bank data, only 56.5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population have access to electricity. And as tariffs continue to rise, the poor and their children may find it harder to afford the glow from light bulbs.\n\nThe national situation is exacerbated by rising insecurity. While the number of out-of-school-children in Nigeria has dropped to 6.9 million from 10.1 million, with the help of the Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) programme in Nigeria, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has noted that \u201cmore and more children are joining the queue.\u201d Between December and March 2020, over 600 students were kidnapped from schools across the country. \u201cStudent kidnappings threaten collapse of Nigerian education system,\u201d two scholars warned in April.\n\n\u201cGovernment has a lot of work to do,\u201d Zam Daniel, a teacher in Abuja, said. \u201cIn the education sector, we are about 50 years behind developed countries.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, Nigeria must work to democratise digital education.\n\n\u201cIf it is our right to be educated and the web is now the biggest source of information,\u201d Adetola Omolade, a teacher at Greensprings School in Lagos, said.\n\n\u201cthen I think access to the internet is a basic human right.\u201d",

Although there was initial fear, the mobilisation and sensitization were able to allay the fears of members,\u2019\u2019 Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said the registration and revalidation of members across the country recorded more than 40 million members, and an appeal committee was also set up to hear all matters related to the process so that no member gets disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that youth and women constitute the huge population of the voting group. We had a youth and women committee, and also people with disability,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said a Contact and Strategy Team had been set up in every state to come up with an acceptable template that would ensure transparency, credibility, and acceptability of the internal electoral processes.\n\nBuni also said the committee had instituted a process to review the party\u2019s constitution and look into loopholes that usually fan conflict and litigations among members, with more than 500 memoranda already received.\n\nThe CECPC Chairman told the President and other party members that 14 party members had indicated their interest to contest for the Anambra State elections, assuring that the primary elections will be free, fair, and transparent.\n\nThe Yobe State governor said huge legal fees were inherited, and the committee had worked with members to settle all the outstanding, after scaling them down, noting that payment for the APC National Secretariat had been completed.\n\n\u201cThe party members have agreed to name the secretariat, Muhammadu Buhari House,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nWhile thanking the President for his support and insight, Buni noted that a National Conference for the Youths was organized recently as part of the bottom-up approach to strengthening the party and ensuring the relevance of all stakeholders.\n\nSome members of the APC who attended the meeting include, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, Progressives Governors Forum, and Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, and Chairman of Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong.

          "text": "More than a dozen fully vaccinated doctors have died of Covid-19 in Indonesia, according to a medical association, as the Southeast Asian country battles a rash of severe cases in inoculated medical workers and highly infectious new virus strains.\n\nInfections have surged in the nation of 270 million people in the past week, with more than 2.05 million cases reported as of Saturday, as hospital occupancy rates soared to more than 75 percent in Jakarta and other hard-hit areas.\n\nNearly 1,000 Indonesian health workers have died from the virus since the pandemic started, with the country\u2019s medical association confirming on Friday that 401 doctors were among the victims \u2013 14 of whom were fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are still updating the data and confirming whether the other cases had been vaccinated or not,\u201d the association\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation head Mohammad Adib Khumaidi told journalists.\n\nThe rise of severe cases in inoculated medical workers has raised questions about the China-produced Sinovac jab, which Indonesia is heavily relying on to vaccinate more than 180 million people by early next year.\n\nThis month, more than 300 vaccinated doctors and healthcare workers in Central Java were found to have been infected with COVID-19, with about a dozen hospitalised.\n\nThe country is also grappling with new virus strains, including the highly infectious Delta variant first identified in India.\n\nIn the capital, Jakarta, the surge in cases have forced hospitals to set up emergency tents, according to Detik news website, which quoted provincial government officials.\n\nIn Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province, Dr Inke Nadia D Lubis, member of the COVID task force in the area, reported that in the last six months as many as 1,800 children have been infected with the virus, including 14 who have died.\n\nMore than a third of the cases reported were elementary school-age students, while a quarter were high school-age students, Inke was quoted by Detik as saying.\n\nOn Friday, President Joko Widodo said that the country is facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d, vowing to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d while urging his countrymen to cooperate in the government\u2019s response.\n\nClinical symptoms suggest that strain is responsible for a surge in cases in West Java, the medical association\u2019s spokesperson for the province, Eka Mulyana, said.\n\n\u201cIn West Java, bed occupancy rates have exceeded 90 percent. Some hospitals\u2019 rates are even more than 100 percent,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, our health system is close to collapse.\u201d\n\nDozens of communities in Central Java\u2019s Kudus regency were put under lockdown after the Delta variant was detected in local testing samples, causing a sudden spike in virus cases.\n\nA patient rests on the floor at a temporary tent outside the emergency ward of a government hospital, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in Bekasi, on the outskirts of Jakarta on Friday [Willy Kurniawan/Reuters]\n\nThe surge has been partly blamed on millions travelling from that region across the Muslim-majority nation at the end of Ramadan last month, despite an official ban on the annual migration.\n\nThe Indonesian medical association\u2019s Kudus representative, Ahmad Ipul Syaifuddin, has said the mass movement of people had made it next to impossible to determine where the surge began.\n\n\u201cWe have no clue on how to trace and find the first spreader of the Delta cases because the sampling test result came out around three weeks after the mass exodus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy sample was among the tested sampling for the Delta variant. I have already recovered and (have) tested negative now, but I still have a cough.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Jakarta Post reported that among those who were recently infected with the coronavirus is an unnamed Indonesian official, who was travelling to Italy for an international conference.\n\nThe official is under quarantine for 10 days after testing positive upon arrival at the Sicilian port city of Catania, where officials from around the world were convening for a series of G20 ministerial meetings.",

          "text": "The widow of John McAfee, the British-American tycoon who died in a Spanish prison this week while awaiting extradition to the United States, on Friday demanded a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d of his death, saying her husband did not appear suicidal when they last spoke.\n\nAuthorities in Spain are conducting an autopsy on McAfee\u2019s body but have said that everything at the scene in his cell indicated that the 75-year-old killed himself.\n\nAn official source familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that a suicide note had been found in McAfee\u2019s pocket. The source, who was not authorized to speak about an ongoing judicial inquiry, refused to comment on the content of the note.\n\nMcAfee\u2019s Spanish lawyer, Javier Villalba, said that the family had not been informed by authorities about the note.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the software entrepreneur\u2019s death on Wednesday, McAfee\u2019s widow Janice McAfee said she wanted a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d to provide \u201canswers about this was able to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis last words to me were \u2018I love you and I will call you in the evening,\u2019\u201d the 38-year-old told reporters outside the Brians 2 penitentiary northwest of Barcelona where she recovered her late husband\u2019s belongings. She said they spoke earlier on the day he was found dead.\n\n\u201cThose words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,\u201d she added.\n\nJohn McAfee was arrested at the Barcelona airport in October last year on a warrant issued by prosecutors in Tennessee who were seeking up to three decades of imprisonment for allegedly evading more than $4 million in taxes.\n\nThe day before he was found dead, Spain\u2019s National Court had announced that it was agreeing to his extradition to the U.S. but the decision was not final.\n\n\u201cWe had a plan of action already in place to appeal that decision,\u201d Janice McAfee told reporters. \u201cI blame the U.S. authorities for this tragedy: Because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.\u201d\n\nThe National Court judge said John McAfee had provided no evidence to back his allegations that he was being politically persecuted. \u201cOn the contrary, according to his own testimony, he took part in primaries of a certain party to defend his convictions with a result little favorable to him,\u201d the judge wrote in the ruling seen by AP.\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, the U.S. State Department confirmed for the first time the tycoon\u2019s death, offering the family condolences. It said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring local authorities\u2019 investigation into the cause of death. We stand ready to provide all appropriate assistance to the family. Out of respect to the family during this difficult time, we have no further comment.\u201d\n\nResults of McAfee\u2019s autopsy could take \u201cdays or weeks,\u201d authorities have said.\n\nThe couple reportedly met in 2012 in Miami and married the following year. John McAfee had several children from previous relationships, Janice McAfee said.\n\nThe entrepreneur had not been connected with the companies that took over the antivirus software he built after he sold his shares in the 1990s. That early success had made McAfee rich and followed him in his troubled biography.\n\nIn 2012, he was sought for questioning in connection with the murder of his neighbor in Belize, but was never charged with a crime. The controversy didn\u2019t stop him from making long-shot runs for the U.S. presidency starting in 2016.\n\nBut it was his more recent tax problems that kept him away from the U.S., the country where the British-born entrepreneur was raised and had built his early success.\n\nThe Tennessee prosecutors\u2019 indictments from 2020 showed that the tycoon allegedly failed to declare income made by promoting cryptocurrencies, attending speaking engagements and selling the rights for a documentary on his eventful life.\n\n\u201cEven though he was born in England, America was his home,\u201d Janice McAfee said. \u201cHe came there when he was a child. He had his first girlfriend there, his first case, you know, his first job. He made his first millions there and he wanted to be there. But, you know, politics just wouldn\u2019t allow for that to happen.\u201d\n\nJohn McAfee\u2019s social media postings indicated that he had chosen a northeastern Spanish coastal resort town as his base in Europe at least since late 2019.\n\n\u201cAll John wanted to do was spend his remaining years fishing and drinking,\u201d his widow said on Friday. \u201cHe had hope that things would work out. We knew that there would be an uphill battle to continue to fight this situation. But he\u2019s a fighter \u2026 And anybody that knows John, that knows him even a little bit, knows that about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just so loving. He had a big heart and he just loved people and he just wanted to have peace in his life,\u201d Janice McAfee added. \u201cMy prayers are that his soul has found the peace in death that he could not find in life.\u201d",
