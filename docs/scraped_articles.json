          "title": "Nigerians will experience multi-dimensional suffering with subsidy removal \u2013 PFN",
          "text": "The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria has told the Federal Government that removing fuel subsidy will worsen the suffering of majority of Nigerians who are already impoverished.\n\nThe President of PFN, Bishop Wale Oke, urged the government to shelve the proposed policy in order not to worsen people\u2019s hardship and trigger crisis in the country.\n\nOke made the call in a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, on Sunday.\n\nHe noted that the implementation of the policy would lead to hike in the price of fuel and that would have a ripple effect on prices of goods and services.\n\nThe cleric said prices of foodstuffs and other daily needs were going out of reach of the people, noting that if the proposed subsidy removal was implemented, it would worsen the situation.\n\nOke further said the situation in the country was bad because of the steady decline in the purchasing power of Nigerians as a result of the continuous fall in the value of the nation\u2019s currency.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cEverybody will feel it, particularly the less privileged. The negative effects will surely outweigh the positive.\n\n\u201cThe cost of transportation for human and goods across the country and other things connected will skyrocket and this will have a spiral effect on general living standards of the populace; the suffering will be multi-dimensional. Please let all stakeholders be sensitive to this avoidable path and do the needful.\n\n\u201cBy whatever means, let the Federal Government put its heart into ensuring that our refineries are back to life. In addition, in order to stem the rising cost of living, farmers and others connected to them should be encouraged. This is what can help our economy.\u201d\n\nOke said the PFN would always support policies that would enhance good governance, but charged the government to put in place tangible palliative measures that could ameliorate the hardship being experienced.\n\nHe added, \u201cWithout begging the issue, there should be well defined palliative measures in place that can cushion the effect of the hardship being experienced by Nigerians, especially the commoners. One is not talking about political palliatives that never last. We have seen enough of such.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the price of petroleum from its present N165 to N340 per litre, can trigger tension and crises in the country which in turn can paralyse our economy if not handled with utmost care.\n\n\u201cAgain, the planned introduction of N5,000 for 40 million poor Nigerians is to create a cesspool of corruption. How do you define the poor? They, mostly, don\u2019t use telephones. They, mostly, don\u2019t have bank accounts. How will the money get to them?\u201d\n\nAs a panacea to the rising cost of food items, the PFN President advised that farmers and relevant stakeholders should be empowered with relevant tools and funds through loans with little interest.\n\nOke, who is also the Presiding Bishop of The Sword of the Spirit Ministries, implored the government not to relent in its efforts at ensuring that security challenges in the country become a thing of the past.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Our doctors are well-trained and anywhere they go, they will be employed.\n\n\u201cThough, we are not valued in Nigeria, when you go to Europe and America, there is a report recently that over 5,700 Nigerian doctors are practising in UK.\n\n\u201cOn a monthly basis, many Nigerian doctors are travelling out. The issue of brain drain in the nation\u2019s health sector must be properly discussed.\u201d\n\nUja faulted the recent suggestion by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, that medical workers trained by the government should be made to sign a bond that would make them serve the country for at least nine years before they can consider relocating to another country.\n\nThe NMA President noted that with the rules of international convention, no one could stop mobility of labour.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that if you prevent people from going and they stay in Nigeria and are not working, will you force any doctor to see a patient? It is demotivation, it is not something to be contemplated at all.\n\n\u201cThe best thing is to understand the factors responsible for brain drain in health sector and stop them before they become monsters,\u201d Uja said.\n\nAlso, the Joint Health Sector Union in a separate interview with The PUNCH advised the Federal Government to improve working conditions for health workers in the country.\n\nThe union\u2019s spokesperson, Olumide Akintayo, said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t improve working conditions, we will continue to see that most workers will migrate.\n\n\u201cThe issue of brain drain is not just about the physicians; it also has to do with health workers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue in this kind of situation: hostile work environment, lack of consistent pay and all of that.

          "text": "\u2022As earnings grow 13.6%, profit 32.7%\n\n\u2022It is inflation aided \u2013 Analysts\n\nBy Peter Egwuatu\n\nLeading companies in Nigeria have reported sharp increases in income and profits, outperforming the recently released positive figures in Gross Domestic Product, GDP, and inflation.\n\nFinancial statements of the 97companies covering first nine months of this year, Q3\u201921, filed at the Nigerian Exchange Limited, NGX, shows that combined gross earnings grew by 13.6 per cent to N7.3 trillion from N6.4 trillion in the corresponding period Q3\u201920.\n\nREAD ALSO:Access Bank, SME.NG, others partner to roll out female entrepreneurs product\n\nThis indicates faster growth rate compared to the Year-on-Year, YoY, economy (GDP) growth rate of 4.03 per cent reported by the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nMore significantly, the companies\u2019 profit recorded sharp increase as Profit Before Tax, PBT, in Q3\u201921 jumped by 30.8 per cent to N1.7 trillion from N1.3 trillion in the corresponding period Q3\u201920. This gives a significant headroom over the nation\u2019s average inflation rate of 17.42 per cent in the period under review.\n\nFinancial Vanguard findings revealed that the jump in profitability by the 97 companies was fuelled by the Oil and Gas sector which rebounded posting N61.4 billion in Q3\u201921 as against a loss of N41.5billion in Q3\u201921. The rebound was also attributed to the rebound in global energy sector and prices of crude oil at post-COVID lockdown era.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts and stakeholders while commenting on the performance of the companies against the nation\u2019s key macroeconomic indicators expressed divergent views, with many of them saying that the figures do not reflect the economic realities on ground.\n\nAlso some of the analysts who spoke to Financial Vanguard on the development attributed the growth, partly, to the Federal Government\u2019s expansionary budget of 2021, Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN stimulus package to some sectors of the economy to tackle the effect of COVID-19 pandemic among others.\n\nHowever, some analysts and stakeholder argued that the growth in GDP and the steady decline in inflation are nothing to jubilate about as average Nigerians still continue to find it difficult to survive giving the high cost of living in the country.\n\nBut a few others said the growth is just a reflection of recovery from the COVID -19 induced pandemic which they stated was positive and a step in jump-starting the economy for sustained growth.\n\nLeading sectors\n\nThe banking sector in Q3\u201921 came top in absolute term as it recorded positive performance in both earnings and profitability rising by 3.7 per cent and 3.13 per cent to N2.54 trillion and N701 billion from N2.45 trillion and N680 billion in Q3\u201920 respectively. The sector accounted for 34.8 per cent of the combined companies\u2019 earnings.\n\nTrailing behind the banking sector on earnings performance is ICT/Computer based sector recording N1.2 trillion and accounting for 16.8 per cent of the combined earnings while it occupied third position on the PBT chart recording N322 billion and accounting for 18.6 per cent of the combined companies\u2019 PBT.\n\nThe Industrial sector occupied the third position on the combined earnings chart recording N1.02 trillion and accounted for 14 per cent of the combined companies\u2019 earnings. In terms of PBT the sector occupied the second position posting N471.6 billion and accounted 27.3 per cent.\n\nAnalysts/stakeholders\u2019 views\n\nCommenting on the corporate performance in Q3\u201921 in relation to the economy, analyst and Vice Executive Chairman, HighCap Securities Limited, David Adonri, said: \u201cDeclining inflation indicates that the fiscal economy (Production & Trade) is improving, although, this assertion is subject to monetary stability. Some of the growths in earnings by listed companies were inflation aided due to increase in prices of their products. Many of the companies also undertook cost saving measures. With opening up of the global economy and restoration of global supply chain, and increasing demand, business activities are surging, leading to increased production and corporate earnings. However, despite improving corporate performance, because factors that fuel inflation and influence GDP are more encompassing, these macroeconomic indicators may still lag behind corporates.\n\nWhile commenting on the impact of GDP and inflation to the future of the economy, he added: \u201cIncreasing GDP and declining inflation are predicted to continue till year end. Additionally, with favourable crude oil price, improved performance of listed companies should be sustained till year end.\u201d\n\nIn terms of banks marginal performance, Adonri, said: \u201cDuring the lockdown of 2020, banking business shifted seamlessly to the virtual channels. So, their earnings were not depressed. Therefore, in comparison to last year, nothing has really changed for them. Their performance is stable and growth has nearly plateaued. A big surge in macroeconomic conditions, especially security can reopen closed channels and open new opportunities for them.\u201d\n\nReacting as well, analyst and Managing Director of APT Securities & Funds Limited, Mallam Garba Kurfi said: \u201cThe performance of Q3\u201921 results is mixed while some have very good results especially the cement and telecoms companies while Banking and Insurance have mixed results. Yes, it is as you observed that industry such as cement manufacturing companies are running successfully with their products and are in serious demand with increase in both turnover and profits .\n\nThe growth recorded by Telecom, Industrial and Consumer Goods give confidence as the country is gradually returning to growth, same apply to other industries. I am not surprised that GDP grew, remember we are in expansionary budget which are the root to growth economy. Actually, the growth recorded by these companies is induced by expansionary budget and other intervention by the CBN.\u201d\n\nCommenting , analyst and Head of Research and Investment at Fidelity Securities Limited, Victor Chiazor said: \u201cYear on year \u201c(YoY) performance of listed companies will always be mixed in the sense that all companies cannot continue to report impressive numbers as there will be periods where policies and the economic situation will be favourable to some and unfavourable to the others.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cIn my view on the banking sector some of them reported significant gains from their trading income last year especially from bond trades given the drop in yields and rice in bond prices.\n\n\u201cBanks that were unable to repeat such gains from trading or other line items reported drop in profit for the period which we saw for most tier-2 bank while most of the tier-1 banks found ways to cushion the effect of the drop in trading income.\n\n\u201cThe industrial sector was already coming from a low base due to the lower level of activity reported for first half of 2020 due to the lock down. Hence it was possible for most of them to report higher profits for the period.\n\nOn the GDP growth, he said: \u201cThe latest GDP figure is quite inspiring to say the least given the tough economic periods witnessed in the past. However, this rise was partly boosted by a low base effect in 2020 as the economy contracted by 3.62 per cent in Q3\u20192020 on the back of the partial lockdown imposed due to COVID-19 during Q3\u20192020.\n\nThe government will have to believe that what it is doing is enough to support the economy but also do more by making the fiscal authorities more visible and proactive as seen with the monetary authorities. Initiatives to reverse the consistent contraction in the mining and quarrying sector as well as improve growth in Agricultural sector needs to be the focus of the government in the near term, while we also believe that the real trajectory of the Nigerian economy will be clearer from Q2\u20192022 when the GDP growth rate isn\u2019t supported by a low base effect.\u201d\n\nResponding as well, Chairman, Pragmatic Shareholders Association of Nigeria, PSAN, Mrs Bisi Bakare, said: \u201cI quite agree with the insinuation that the figure displayed by NBS isn\u2019t a reflection of reality on ground. The companies are even trying to survive so we even appreciate their performance no matter how small. Even from the escalating cost of food stuff coupled with high transport cost of food stuff, unabated increase in price of gas and other domestic items we know that inflation is not dropping. All these have continually made the cost of living to be high which has eaten deep into our purchasing power. So what is there to jubilate when we say GDP has grown?\n\nMr Boniface Okezie, Chairman Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria, said: \u201cOur companies are trying to survive given the harsh operating environment. Though, there were missed performance of companies results in the Q3\u201921. The government is deceiving the masses with all these macroeconomic figures being shunned out.\n\nThey say GDP rose when dollar in the parallel market is on the rise. They say inflation is dropping when purchasing power of the people is dropping. How many of the banks are lending to the manufacturing sector to boost output. So I don\u2019t really believe in these figures.\u201d",

          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA-PRELIMINARY evidence suggests that the new COVID-19 variant, B.1.1.529, named \u2018Omicron\u2019,by the World Health Organisation, WHO,has an increased risk of reinfection.\n\nAlso,several labs have indicated that for one widely used polymerase chain reaction,PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure) and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation, according to the WHO.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps probe utilization of N200bn spent on construction of Lokoja- Benin Road\n\nThe global health agency said,\u201dUsing this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs,\u201dWHO had said in a statement, classifying Omicron (B.1.1.529): SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern,VOC,\u201dWHO said.\n\nThe designation of the variant came following advice from the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE), an independent group of experts that periodically monitors and evaluates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and assesses if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behaviour of the virus.\n\n\u201d The TAG-VE was convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the SARS-CoV-2 variant: B.1.1.529,\u201dthe agency explained.\n\nIt explained that,\u201dThe B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the Delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.\n\n\u201d The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant,\u201dit said.\n\nAccording to the organisation,\u201dThere are a number of studies underway and the TAG-VE will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings with Member States and to the public as needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence presented indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, the TAG-VE has advised WHO that this variant should be designated as a VOC, and the WHO has designated B.1.1.529 as a VOC, named Omicron,\u201dthe statement had explained.\n\n\u201cAs such, countries are asked to do the following:enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nsubmit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID. Report initial cases/clusters associated with VOC infection to WHO through the IHR mechanism.\n\n\u201cWhere capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics.\n\n\u201cIndividuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cFor reference, WHO has working definitions for SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Interest (VOI) and Variant of Concern (VOC).\n\nA SARS-CoV-2 VOI is a SARS-CoV-2 variant:with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; AND\n\nthat has been identified as causing significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health.\n\nA SARS-CoV-2 VOC is a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance:increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR\n\nincrease in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; OR\n\ndecrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics,\u201dit had further read.",

Go to Kuje prison and find out the ages of the people who end up in jail.\n\n\u201cThose who are now insurgents and bandits, information reaching us, is that many of the heads of those bandits are all young people, because of the way they have been trained.\n\n\u201cSo, it shows immediately and you don\u2019t have to wait for 10 or 20 years to see the implications of not doing anything to tackle the menace of street children.\n\nA major concern for the elite in the Northern Nigeria is the fact that they have millions of young people who never went through school.\n\n\u201c10 years ago, these youths were children, but today they are teenagers and young men who have no skill of any sort, and they are ready to be recruited to do anything.\n\n\u201cToday, we are already facing it, and if we say that security is very difficult, this is one of the reasons why. It is not too late, if we decide to work seriously about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only the children of the rich people who deserve to be alive, the children of the poor also have a future. Some of the poor children of today can be important people tomorrow. I think the film has made the case very strongly and very clearly.\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating the producers of the movie, he said, \u201cthe film has brought in the religious aspects, because in many of these things you need to have a religious enthusiasm, because you will not make money doing this kind of thing.\n\n\u201cI am happy that the work of the Salesians of Don Bosco is brought to the highlight in this film. Of course, they are not the only ones that are looking after abandoned youths and children, but they specialise in this because of their founder Don Bosco who spent most of his time looking after abandoned children.\n\nExecutive Producer of the movie, Revered Father Cyril Odia, said the idea of the movie stemmed from plights of abandoned children and how they could be assisted to become useful to the society.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe attempt of this movie is to call for action. As Salesians, we believe in faith in action. If we don\u2019t multiply that effect and get more partners to come on board, we can foresee that there is going to be disaster. The more young people are increasing on the street, the more the threat of insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe movie has received a very positive and heartwarming response from two categories of viewers. For some viewers, the positive ending of the story confirms the desire for good to always overcome evil especially in the light of modern-day Christian persecution.\n\n\u201cFor other viewers the movie gives hope about the Catholic mission to young and poor people who often have little or no hope in politicians. Many got a validation of the idea that religion has a lot of capacity to bring about social change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe film is produced and directed by the Nigerian director, Obi Emelonye with Rich Lowe Ikenna in the leading role.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe cold war raging in the All Progressives Congress (APC), especially between the APC progressive governors and the Presidency over zoning of the party\u2019s positions and the 2023 presidential ticket deepened at the weekend.\n\nContrary to speculations that the governors were sharply divided in support of two frontline presidential aspirants, a reliable source told Sunday Sun that the major disagreement within the party currently is the insistence by the governors that one of them must emerge the party\u2019s candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nReferencing what transpired during the regime of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the source claimed that the progressive governors are pressuring President Muhammadu Buhari to endorse the arrangements for one of them to emerge as the presidential candidate of the ruling party ahead of other contenders.\n\nOur source equally disclosed that there are indications that the northern caucus of the party has finally conceded the presidential ticket to the South, adding that the final agreement is that while all the party positions hitherto held by the North will henceforth automatically shift to the South and vice-versa, the North-central will produce the party\u2019s national chairman in the planned February national convention.\n\n\u201cThe governors are hell-bent on one of them emerging as the party\u2019s standard bearer for the 2023 presidential poll and they are not bulging on it. They have taken their resolutions to Mr President, including the appeal that he endorses the plans for one of them to pick the presidential ticket of the party. The governors had specifically reminded Mr President on the need to toe the line of former President Obasanjo in the 2007 presidential election by supporting and possibly influencing any of them picking the ticket for the 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cHowever, you know the kind of person Mr President is. Expectedly, the governors did not get a desired categorical response from him. It is certain that he will not brazenly or autocratically impose any candidate on the party members, but he will certainly play a vital role in influencing who gets the ticket,\u201d the source submitted.\n\nExplaining further the political undercurrent and dynamics ahead of the 2023 general elections, our source said that despite the insistence of the majority of the governors on one of them picking the ticket, there are, however, some of them equally supporting the proposal for former President Goodluck Jonathan to be given the ticket with one of them becoming his vice.\n\n\u201cAgain, there is some level of division in the camp of the governors because while some of them are rooting for frontline contenders like Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu and/or the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, there are an insignificant number of them rooting for former President Jonathan with one of them as the vice president, just as greater percentage of them are favourably disposed to one of their own getting the ticket,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn the zoning arrangements for the party\u2019s national leadership positions, our source disclosed that what is perhaps becoming certain was that the leadership of the party in the North may have settled for production of the party\u2019s national leadership positions, conceding the presidential ticket to the South.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is too early to confirm the permutations of which zone will get the presidential ticket or where it will be micro-zoned, what is, however, certain is that the leaders of the party have unanimously agreed that all the party\u2019s leadership positions formally occupied by the South should go to the North. That must be the reason the North-central has been tactically endorsed to produce the party\u2019s national chairmanship position.\n\n\u201cWith this arrangement, it is therefore easy to conclude that the North has also conceded the presidential ticket to the South for now. But I must have to add that this agreement is not yet cast on the marble because there are still several contending forces that may change the political dynamics, especially the tricks by the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Whatever resolutions we arrive at now will be highly dependent on how things unfold in the camp of other political parties because we are not operating in isolation,\u201d the source said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Is Nigeria going to receive the South African President and other officials when other countries are banning travellers from South Africa? Is the federal government going to tell them not to come? Under what structure are they going to come?\u201d a top official of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) queried.\n\nThe visit will be President Ramaphosa\u2019s first visit to Nigeria in his official capacity as the substantive president since he was elected some three years ago.\n\nHe had visited Nigeria in 2018, as the acting president, following the exit of former President Jacob Zuma from office.\n\nThere are about 120 South African firms in Nigeria, including the telecommunication giant, MTN, DSTV whose parent company, Multichoice, remains the number one leading player in the cable TV ecosystem in the country.\n\nHowever, only a few Nigerian firms are operating in South Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Thatcher asked Nigeria to ascertain S\u2019African leader\u2019s commitment to majority rule\n\nEjiofor Alike\n\nA former National Security Adviser (NSA), Lieutenant General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau (rtd), has highlighted Nigeria\u2019s role to end the apartheid regime in South Africa.\n\nIn a tribute to the former President of South Africa, the late Frederik Willem de Klerk, which was obtained by THISDAY, Gusau disclosed that the then British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, had specifically asked the former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida to ascertain the commitment of De Klerk to majority rule.\n\nDe Klerk, who was the last minority president of South Africa, later became the late President Nelson Mandela\u2019s deputy under the majority rule.\n\nGusau stated that Thatcher had in 1989 visited Nigeria twice within one week where he told Babangida that de Klerk was working to bring an end to minority rule in South Africa.\n\nAccording to the former NSA, Thatcher also sought the help of Nigeria to ascertain the level of de Klerk\u2019s commitment and also strengthen de Klerk\u2019s efforts.\n\nGusau noted that while Babangida believed that Thatcher was an honest broker on the issue, the former military leader had doubts as to whether de Klerk meant business or that he would get the support of the white establishment in South Africa\n\nThe former NSA described the late former president of South African as a towering figure who was determined to right historical wrongs without minding the consequences.\n\nGusau said Nigeria\u2019s strategic role to end apartheid started on March 28, 1989, when, on her way to South Africa, the then British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher decided to do a stop-over in Lagos to see Babangida.\n\nThe former NSA quoted Thatcher as telling journalists at the airport that she was very \u201chappy to accept President Babangida\u2019s invitation to stop over in Lagos to have talks with him.\n\n\u201cI do this because I have great admiration for the leadership he is giving here and for the courageous way in which he is tackling the economic problems of the country,\u201d she had added.\n\nThatcher had also disclosed that since she and Babangida would be attending the Commonwealth Conference CHOGM scheduled to hold in Malaysia in October of that year, her visit was an opportunity to chat with the Nigerian leader ahead of the conference.\n\nGusau said the former British Prime Minister also took a few questions after her brief remarks, which were all centred around the situation in South Africa and the role of Britain at the time.\n\n\u201cWhile she was evasive in her responses, Mrs. Thatcher alluded to a meeting between Soviet and British academics and the ANC \u2018in which they urged that the problems of South Africa be solved not by confrontation, not by violence, but by negotiation. That is our objective too.\u2019 By her return itinerary, Mrs. Thatcher was to do a brief stop-over in Accra, to see President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, before heading for London. But she again routed her flight from South Africa through Lagos where she met President Babangida for a second time within a week,\u201d Gusau explained.\n\nGusau stated that Babangida later invited him for a briefing after Thatcher\u2019s visits and saddled him with what he (Gusau) described as a delicate assignment.\n\nRevealing what transpired between him and Babangida, the former NSA stated that the former military president informed him that Thatcher had told him (Babangida) in their two meetings that de Klerk was working to bring an end to minority rule in South Africa.\n\nGusau also disclosed that Babangida told him that the former British leader sought the help of Nigeria to ascertain the level de Klerk\u2019s commitment and also see how Nigeria could strengthen de Klerk\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cWhile President Babangida said he believed Mrs. Thatcher as an honest broker on the issue, he had doubts as to whether President de Klerk meant business or that he would get the support of the white establishment in South Africa on such idea. The assignment President Babangida then gave me was to ascertain how serious President de Klerk was on ending apartheid in South Africa as well as what Nigeria could do to help that process,\u201d Gusau said.\n\nThe former NSA also disclosed that after Babangida had given him a list of contacts within the South African government, including close aides of President de Klerk, he decided to co-opt his Chief of Staff, Colonel Kayode Are into the assignment given to him by the former military ruler.\n\n\u201cColonel Are was not only my chief of staff at the time but also a close friend whose opinion I deeply valued. The two of us embarked on this extraordinary mission with no time to spare. We first met with the then Director-General of South Africa\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS), Dr. Niel Barnard, in London on 15th January 1990. That marked the beginning of a long and enduring partnership between our two institutions, and I visited South Africa several times thereafter to discuss the way forward. I also had direct sessions with President de Klerk who, in our first meeting, made it clear that he wanted to be the last minority president. I was a bit skeptical about that even though he sounded genuine,\u201d Gusau explained.\n\n\u201cOn 2nd February 1990, while we were still working underground with their security officials, President de Klerk took the world by surprise. In his address at the opening session of parliament, he announced the end of segregation of public facilities in South Africa, recognised the African National Congress (ANC) as a legitimate political party, and set a date for the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of incarceration. Not surprisingly, as de Klerk made his speech, there were shouts of \u2018traitor\u2019 from several MPs within his own Conservative Party, who staged a dramatic walk-out. One of them, Koos van der Merwe later addressed the media where he described de Klerk as a traitor to his people\u2019 because, by the declaration, the then South African president was \u201ctrying to kill the Afrikaner nation,\u201d Gusau added.\n\nGusau said de Klerk\u2019s historic speech had led to far-reaching political reforms and had also marked the beginning of the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa.\n\nHe said he visited de Klerk four weeks later in Cape Town with a letter from Babangida, adding that the culmination of their discussion was a meeting between both presidents in Windhoek on March 31, 1990, at the sidelines of Namibia\u2019s Independence Day celebration.\n\n\u201cMuch more significantly, however, five senior Nigerian journalists were in Namibia for the event. When I sounded them out about whether they would like to visit South Africa, they were excited. I discussed the idea with South African officials, and it was agreed that they could undertake a visit. A vehicle was provided for the long journey that took almost 20 hours from Windhoek to Johannesburg. The reports filed by these top journalists when they returned to Nigeria validated most of what Colonel Are and I had witnessed which confirmed that De Klerk was moving in the direction of majority rule,\u201d Gusau said.\n\nGusau noted that at some point, he discovered that while Nigeria\u2019s engagements with South African officials were cordial and fruitful, it was also necessary to brief the leader of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.\n\nHe said he had received the feedback from reliable South African contacts that Buthelezi was aware of Nigerian mediation, stressing that as a critical factor in the country, Buthelezi needed to be carried along.\n\n\u201cPresident Babangida wrote him a letter. Having welcomed the idea, the South African Government provided the plane that took me to Ulundi, capital of Zulu Kingdom where Chief Buthelezi was happy to receive me. He called his entire cabinet before reading President Babangida\u2019s letter. There and then he asked the Cabinet Secretary to draft a reply. I then drove with him to the statute of their ancestral warrior, Shaka Zulu where we took photographs before I flew back to Johannesburg,\u201d Gusau explained.\n\nGusau said although he and Colonel Are worked underground in their engagements with the South African government, some of their colleagues within the continent alleged that high-ranking Nigerian officials were collaborating with the apartheid regime, adding that a few African leaders were uncomfortable with the information.\n\nHe, however, stated that the problem was left for Babangida to handle with his colleagues.\n\n\u201cIn April 1992, President de Klerk undertook a three-day State Visit to Nigeria at the invitation of President Babangida. The visit was the first by a South African head of state to our country, and President Babangida\u2014who was at that period chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (now African Union)\u2014signaled to the continent and the rest of the world that Nigeria supported President De Klerk in his efforts. This certainly was the key to South Africa\u2019s acceptance by the rest of the continent.\n\n\u201cFollowing President de Klerk\u2019s death on 11th November this year, his office issued a prerecorded posthumous video where he tendered an apology for \u201cthe pain and the hurt and the indignity and the damage that apartheid has done to black, brown and Indians in South Africa.\u201d I believe he genuinely meant what he said.\n\n\u201cIn their tribute, the Mandela Foundation said that President de Klerk would \u201cforever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history\u201d while President Cyril Ramaphosa said de Klerk \u201ctook the courageous decision [as president] to unban political parties, release political prisoners and enter into negotiations with the liberation movement amid severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I reflect on the legacy of the late President de Klerk, I am reminded of the extraordinary things ordinary people can achieve. It took great courage for President de Klerk to stand up to the white establishment in South Africa after which he accepted the position of a deputy in President Nelson Mandela\u2019s ANC-led Government of National Unity. He will therefore be remembered as a peacemaker who changed the course of history in his country. And I am grateful for the part that Nigeria played in supporting his efforts while I salute the courage of President Babangida for taking the right decision at the time,\u201d Gusau concluded.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Set to Establish Int\u2019l Financial Centre at Eko Atlantic City",
          "text": "\u2022Targets pool of global funds\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has disclosed plans by the apex bank to set up an International Financial Centre at the Eko Atlantic City in Lagos to be operational in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nEmefiele explained that the facility is expected to serve as a hub for attracting domestic and external capital which is much-needed to strengthen the Nigerian economy post-COVID-19.\n\nThe CBN governor stated this in a keynote address he delivered at the 56th Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) annual dinner held in Lagos at the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe International Finance Centre when fully operational in the 2nd quarter of 2022, will help to position Nigeria as a key destination for investment in Africa,\u201d Emefiele added.\n\nThe CBN governor noted that a key challenge to supporting growth in key sectors of the economy was access to large pools of cheap investment capital, adding that over $100 trillion was being held by institutional investors in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.\n\nAccording to him, most of the funds were invested in low-yielding assets relative to high-yielding opportunities in Nigeria.\n\nFurthermore, Emefiele noted that although uncertainties remained around the mutating Delta virus, prospects of a broad-based economic recovery in Nigeria were bright as efforts were being made to improve access to vaccines for Nigerians, in addition to measures aimed at implementing safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that \u201cour economic growth remains fragile, as our unemployment and inflation rate remains at levels that are not very supportive of growth. Second, continued implementation of our intervention efforts would need to be undertaken to sustain the recovery efforts and stimulate further growth of the economy.\n\n\u201cThird, given population growth at about 2.7 per cent annually, it is important that we continue to deploy measures that will enable our economy to attain annual growth rates of over five per cent.\n\n\u201cThrough the pandemic, we are aware that our policy responses are often more effective when we work with the private sector. For example, the CACOVID alliance played an instrumental role in reducing the negative effects of the pandemic, by providing palliative support to families affected by the virus and in rebuilding our healthcare institutions.\n\n\u201cLeveraging the strength of the private sector will be critical in mobilising funds that are needed toward building a more resilient and stronger economy. We intend to strengthen collaborations with the private sector to support investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, and ICT, in addition to ongoing efforts to build a stronger agriculture and manufacturing base in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a result, all efforts in 2022 must be made to ensure that we maintain our focus on improving access to finance and credit for households and businesses, mobilising investment to boost domestic productivity, enabling faster growth of non-oil exports, and supporting employment generating activities,\u201d he explained.\n\nCommenting on the recently introduced 100 for 100 policy on production and productivity, he reiterated that the programme targets credit of up to N5 billion to be provided to 100 firms every 100 days, provided that the firms are investing in projects that are Greenfield projects.\n\nSecondly, projects would be assessed on their ability to generate significant employment opportunities in critical sectors of the economy, he added.\n\nThirdly on the 100 for 100 policy, he pointed out that eligible firms must show evidence of their efforts to harness available local raw materials towards the realisation of their intended investment.\n\nEmefiele also said efforts would be made to support firms geared towards producing goods for the export market.\n\n\u201cLet me add that routine audits will be conducted on firms that receive funding, to ensure that they are complying with the terms of the program. We believe this program will significantly help to catalyse growth in critical sectors of our economy while aiding our efforts to create employment opportunities and reduce our dependence on imported goods.\n\n\u201cA key focus of the Central Bank of Nigeria under my leadership has been enabling the build-out of a robust payment system in Nigeria that will provide cheap, efficient, and faster means of conducting payments for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWith the growing pace of digitisation globally, it is essential that we leverage digital channels in fulfilling this objective. Total transaction volumes using digital channels more than doubled between 2018 and 2020, as volumes rose from 1.3 billion to over 3.3 billion financial transactions in 2020.\n\n\u201cDigital payment channels also help to support continued conduct of business activities during the lockdown. Our robust payment system has continued to evolve towards meeting the needs of households and businesses in Nigeria. Reflective of the confidence in our payment system, between 2015 and September 2021, about $900 million has been invested in firms run by Nigerian founders.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding these gains, close to 36 per cent of adult Nigerians do not have access to financial services. Improving access to finance for individuals and businesses through digital channels can help to improve financial inclusion, lower the cost of transactions, and increase the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\n\u201cIt is in this vein that the Central Bank of Nigeria recently deployed the first central bank digital currency in Africa, the e-Naira, which would help in attaining our goals of fostering greater inclusion using digital channels, supporting cross border payments for businesses and firms, and providing a reliable channel for remittance inflows into the country.\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira will ensure that Nigerians in remote areas can conduct financial activities using their digital devices at little or no cost. It will also help to strengthen the effectiveness of government intervention programs, as funds provided will get to the intended beneficiaries. In less than four weeks since its launch, almost 600,000 downloads of the e-naira application have taken place.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEfforts are ongoing to encourage faster adoption of the e-naira by Nigerians who do not have smartphones. The support of the financial industry will be critical in the ongoing deployment of the e-naira and efforts are ongoing to encourage continued partnership between the CBN and stakeholders in the financial industry.\n\n\u201cWith the decline in revenues due to federal and state government as a result of reduced receipts from the sale of crude oil, alternative ways of funding infrastructure are critical if we are to ensure sustained growth of our economy. As we are all aware, the cost of logistics is often seen as a significant impediment to the growth of businesses in the country.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the role improved infrastructure could play in the development of our economy, along with the need to leverage private sector capital in funding the over N35 trillion deficit, which is the estimated amount required to build an efficient infrastructure ecosystem in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria working in partnership with critical stakeholders such as the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and African Finance Corporation (AFC) set up Infracorp. Infracorp is expected to raise over N15 trillion to support investment in critical infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo far, N1 trillion has been provided as seed funds by the promoters to support the operations of Infracorp. We recently appointed four fund managers, and a Management Team has been selected to run and manage Infracorp.\n\n\u201cOver the next two months, Infracorp will kick off its operations by targeting strategic infrastructure projects that would help catalyse further growth of our economy. Infracorp is expected to set the standard template that will help in enabling greater private sector funding for public infrastructure projects in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for 2022, Emefiele revealed that CBN\u2019s in-house model, after an exhaustive simulation with various oil price possibilities and numerous scenarios of other macroeconomic metrics, indicates a continued and strong rebound of the domestic economy.\n\nHe said the near-term outlook of the Nigerian economy was brightening significantly, with improvements projected into the short- and the medium-term. He projected that the real GDP growth rate would remain robust and strengthen within the short term.\n\n\u201cOutput growth rate is projected to remain positive from 4.03 per cent in 2021q3 to nearly 2.91 per cent in 2021 fourth quarter, implying a total growth of about 3.10 percent for 2021. The short-term projection indicates a continued strengthening of the growth rate.\n\n\u201cDeliberate structural policies and reforms are needed to raise this projected trend higher towards the desired five per cent average growth level.\n\n\u201cOutput growth rate for the Nigerian economy is broadly estimated by key institutions to consolidate in 2021. The IMF and the World Bank project real growth rates of 2.6 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively while the estimate by the Federal Ministry of Finance and National planning stands at 3.0 per cent.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the real GDP growth rate is projected to remain robust and strengthen within the short-term, regardless of the immanent vulnerabilities. With this continued strengthening, real GDP could recover beyond the pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of 2022. Further simulations of the medium-term projections suggest that Nigeria\u2019s real GDP could surpass pre-COVID trends by 2024.\n\n\u201cThe business environment remains optimistic given the sustained policy interventions in the economy. The overall business confidence index is projected to rise significantly from -9.2 index points as at end-August to over 37.7 index points in November 2021 and surpass 57.6 index points by mid-2022,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*PSC vows to resist attempt to hijack its mandate\n\n*Force yet to approach S\u2019Court after losing at A\u2019Court\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe last has not been heard of the tussle between the Police Service Commission (PSC) and the Nigerian Police over the recruitment of 10,000 police constables, as both organisations are planning separate exercises for 2021.\n\nThe PSC, had on Wednesday, in Abuja, disclosed that as soon as the 2020 recruitment exercise for which the aptitude test was conducted last week, was concluded, the commission would begin the 2021 exercise.\n\nBut the Inspector General of Police (IG), Usman Alkali Baba, at the weekend called for applications from suitably qualified applicants for the 2021 recruitment exercise.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in 2018 given approval for the recruitment of 60,000 police constables for six years.\n\nThe 2020 recruitment exercise, however, ran into troubled waters when the police insisted that it had the mandate to recruit constables.\n\nBut the PSC had stood its ground, also insisting that it was constitutionally empowered to conduct recruitment for the police.\n\nThe exercise soon became a subject of litigation with the police under the former Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, winning the first round at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe ruling of the high court was later set aside by the Court of Appeal which declared that the Police Service Commission was constitutionally empowered to conduct recruitment of police constables.\n\nWhile the police authorities had given the impression that they would challenge the judgment at the Supreme Court, they were yet to approach the apex court.\n\nOn resumption of duties as the new police chief, Alkali Baba had visited the PSC, and in the spirit of reconciliation, called on the PSC to resume its duties giving the impression that the litigation saga was over.\n\nThe two agencies later held a one-day retreat at the Force Headquarters on the way forward.\n\nBut at a briefing in Abuja, Chairman of the PSC, Mr. Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector-General of Police, stated that as soon as the 2020 exercise which was delayed by the litigations, was concluded, the commission would embark on the recruitment of another 10,000 for 2021 and subsequently kick-start the 2022 edition in fulfillment of the presidential directive for the recruitment of 60,000 police constables.\n\nHe said the position of the commission became necessary following repeated calls and inquiries from Nigerians on whether the commission was part of the process of the ongoing completion of the 2020 recruitment exercise.\n\nHe said aptitude tests for shortlisted applicants from the earlier suspended 2020 recruitment were held on Friday, October 29, and Saturday, October 30, 2021, across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cMr. President, had, in 2018, approved the recruitment of 10,000 Nigerians annually into the constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force for six years. This is to inject needed additional personnel and to bridge the manpower gap in the force, especially with the resurgence of banditry, terrorism, and kidnapping in different parts of the country and regular loss of personnel through dismissal, retirement, natural death, accident, and others\u201d, he said.\n\nThe retired IG said the 2020 recruitment exercise which was suspended midway was the third edition after the successful 2018 and 2019 exercises.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to state that the ongoing completion of the suspended 2020 edition was a joint decision of the commission and that of the Nigeria Police Force and it was meant to further fast-track the injection of required personnel into the force. A joint committee of the commission and that of the Nigeria Police Force met severally in the commission and approved a timeline for the completion of the exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that with the completion of the aptitude tests across the country recently, successful candidates were undergoing medical examinations at the 17 zonal police headquarters in the country after which fit and proper 10,000 candidates would be recruited by the commission and sent to the police colleges/training schools for training.\n\n\u201cThe commission is aware of the manpower gaps in the Nigeria Police Force especially with rapid wastages of officers and men due to many reasons earlier highlighted.\n\n\u201cThe commission wishes to commend Mr. President for his kind and gracious approval for the recruitment of 10,000 Nigerians into the constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force continuously for six years. We are grateful to the National Assembly for the support in approving releases of required funds for this exercise,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the litigation, the PSC chair hinted that the police might still be forging ahead with the court matter.\n\n\u201cThe Appeal Court delivered a favourable judgment to PSC. They (police) have given the impression that they want to go to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe will encourage them to go there because that is the highest court in the land\u201d, he added.\n\nBut the police high command at the weekend called for applications from suitably qualified applicants for the 2021 recruitment exercise.\n\nThe public notice titled: \u201c2021 Recruitment into the Nigeria Police Force,\u201d said in the first paragraph that \u201cthe Nigeria Police Force (NPF) in conjunction with the Police Service Commission (PSC) invites applications from interested and qualified Nigerians for enlistment into the Nigeria Police Force as Police Constable (Recruits)\u201d.\n\nHowever, a top official of the PSC told THISDAY yesterday that the commission would resist any attempt to hijack or undermine its mandate.\n\n\u201cThe commission is amazed and disappointed by the development but will resist any attempt to hijack or undermine its mandate,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Court of Appeal had in its judgment, declared that the Police Act 2020, enacted in September of the same year as it affects the constitutional mandate of the Police Service Commission is unconstitutional and void.\n\nThe provision of the Act, it ruled, was obviously in conflict with paragraph 30 Part 1 of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, which empowers the commission to appoint persons into offices in the Nigeria Police Force except for the office of the Inspector General of Police.\n\nThe details of the Appeal Court judgment in the appeal instituted by the commission against the ruling of the Federal High Court in Abuja, was contained in the Certified True Copy (CTC) received by the Commission on Tuesday, October 13, 2020.\n\nJustice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, one of the three Justices of the Court in his concurrent judgment, ruled that Paragraph 30 of Part 1 of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution gives the power to the commission to appoint persons into offices in the Nigeria Police \u201cand did not exclude constables and cadets to Nigeria Police Academy from offices in the Nigeria Police into which the appellant can appoint persons\u201d\n\nHe further declared that no Act of the National Assembly or law can take away or curtail such power.\n\nJustice Agim noted that even if the Nigeria Police carried out the disputed enlistment under a directive or approval of the President of the federation, \u201cthe enlistment would remain contrary to the Constitution and therefore unconstitutional and void. Such a directive cannot repair its unconstitutionality and illegality\u201d.\n\nIn the lead judgment delivered by Justice Olabisi Ige, the Court of Appeal gave a declaration that by Section 1 subsection 3 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) \u201cany piece of legislation or instrument relied upon by the defendants (including but not limited to the Police Act and the Police Regulations) in exercising or purporting to exercise the powers to appoint, promote, dismiss or discipline persons holding or aspiring to hold offices in the Nigeria Police Force, being inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution particularly section 153 subsection (1)(m), Section 153 subsection (2) and section 215(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and Paragraph 30 part 1 of the Third Schedule to the Constitution, is invalid, null and void and of no effect whatsoever\u201d\n\nIt also gave an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Police, and other defendants, jointly and severally, from interfering or further interfering in any manner howsoever with the commission\u2019s discharge of its constitutional and statutory functions in \u201crespect of the appointment, promotion, dismissal, or exercise of disciplinary control over persons holding or aspiring to hold offices in the Nigeria Police Force other than the Inspector General of Police\u201d.\n\nAttempt to reach Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, was unsuccessful, as he did not respond to text messages sent to his mobile phone on the issue.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "But the Inspector General of Police (IG), Usman Alkali Baba, at the weekend called for applications from suitably qualified applicants for the 2021 recruitment exercise.\nThe 2020 recruitment exercise, however, ran into troubled waters when the police insisted that it had the mandate to recruit constables.\nBut the PSC had stood its ground, also insisting that it was constitutionally empowered to conduct recruitment for the police.\nThe retired IG said the 2020 recruitment exercise which was suspended midway was the third edition after the successful 2018 and 2019 exercises.\nBut the police high command at the weekend called for applications from suitably qualified applicants for the 2021 recruitment exercise.",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Bolt partners with MAX to expand its vehicle finance scheme in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The next frontier for fintech: Disruptive business models",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

          "title": "Nigerian fintech startup, FairMoney, hosts its first \u201cInvestor Conference\u201d",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is just above the global average of 11.7%.\n\nThe report was based on a survey conducted on 1,205 Nigerian Internet users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is the sixth country with the highest rate of NFT adoption out of the 20 countries surveyed. The top five countries were the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nSurprisingly, the US, UK, and Japan, were the bottom three. The survey also went on to estimate that Nigeria\u2019s NFT ownership rate could reach 35% as 21.7% of the surveyed Internet users, plan to own NFTs.\n\nHold on a minute. Can 1,205 Internet users out of 101.72 million tell the true story about NFTs in Nigeria?\n\nHowever, if we consider the fact that Nigeria also ranked sixth in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis maybe Finders.com\u2019s report isn\u2019t too far fetched.\n\nWhat do you think? Are Nigerians really that big on NFTs? Hit reply and let\u2019s know what you think.\n\nAsilimia\u2019s $2m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsilimia team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAfrican fintech startup, Asilimia, has raised $2 million to help African Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), digitise their operations and connect them to the formal financial economy. The funding comprises a $1 million pre-seed and $1 million in debt financing.\n\nThe round saw investment from serial entrepreneur, Fredrik Jung Abbou, Co-founder of two unicorns \u2014 Kry, a telemedicine startup and fintech startup, Lendo. Other investors include Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Bpifrance and GreenTec Capital Partners\n\nHow does Asilimia work? The startup helps MSMEs digitise and formalise their operations \u2014 payments, revenue collection, and accounting \u2014 with its digital platform while providing them with credit facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Tekwane Mwendwa and Morgane Kablan, it helps business owners track expenses, payments, and get financial insights on their mobile phones.\n\nWhile Asilimia\u2019s mission could formalise MSMEs on the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 45% were subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019 according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). That number, however, is expected to reach 50% by 2025.\n\nThe startup plans to grow its team and expand into more East African markets with the funding.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s $3.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePipe team\n\nNigerian fintech API, OnePipe, has closed a $3.5 million seed, co-led by Atlantica Ventures, Tribe Capital and V&R Associates. Other investors include Techstars, Ingressive Capital and Canaan Partners.\n\nOnePipe CEO and Founder, Ope Adeoye, told TechCrunch, that the startup offers embedded banking or banking as a service, \u201cmeaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.\u201d\n\nA little back story: Adeoye was a Senior Software Engineer at Interswitch before moving to Zain Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, he moved back to Interswitch to lead the creation of Quickteller. After eleven years at Interswitch, Adeoye built OnePipe in November 2018 to create seamless partnerships between fintechs and banks.\n\nWith this new funding, the startup has plans to expand into other African countries through a partnership with Sendy, a logistics and freight company.\n\nWant to know more about OnePipe?

          "title": "2023 elections: Nigeria back to pre-1999 era",
          "text": "This year marks 22 years since Nigeria returned to civil rule after years of military dictatorship that drained the economy, increased poverty, made people live life on the edge, rise in social unrest and forced many on voluntary exile.\n\nWhile Abdulsalami Abubakar, the then Head of State, kept to his promise of returning Nigeria to civil rule, and the people felt relieved when Olusegun Obasanjo became the president, that hope reignited in 1999 seems to be lost today as the citizenry faces situations that could be termed worse than the pre-1999 era.\n\nIf the current persisting hardship is what democracy means, many would have preferred military rule as there seems to be no sharp difference, especially with the current administration that is being accused of remaining unmoved in the face of excruciating economic pain in the polity.\n\n\u201cYes, the military generals did not respect the constitution and rule of law, they were brutal and even stole the country dry, but we did not feel the level of insecurity and poverty in the country as we do now,\u201d Fredrick Umelo, a retired civil servant, said.\n\nFor him, Nigeria is in a more precarious situation now than in the pre-1999 election era; a development, according to him, makes nonsense of the 22 years of democratic rule. He queried the conscience and truthfulness of the political elite. He accused the ruling class of plunging more Nigerians today into the abyss of poverty than was the case in 1998 before the elections in 1999.\n\nRead Also: 2023 Elections: Hitting rock bottom, finding a way up\n\n\u201cI think the military should be laughing at the selfish Nigerian politicians, who have proven that democracy cannot work in Nigeria as they have in the 22 years of democratic rule, enriched themselves at the expense of the poor masses.\n\n\u201cHas standard of living improved now? Life expectancy is declining every day; inflation is uncontrollable; unemployment is soaring like never before; killings now appear normal, yet the politicians open their mouths to talk of their achievements in power; which achievement than stashing money in Swiss Bank, pilling debt for unborn children, and directly and indirectly executing their selfish or regional agenda,\u201d the aggrieved retiree lamented.\n\nFor Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, the respite Nigerians witnessed then was real, but the situation on ground is making a mockery of that joy.\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of democratic president in 1999, the world hoped that Nigeria would learn from the long years of military rule, advance from the situation before 1999 and grow her democracy, amid dividends after every general election. But we are not there yet; we seem to start afresh and it is sad,\u201d Onikoyi, who was a university undergraduate at that time, said.\n\nSpeaking further, he noted that while he is in Brussels in Belgium on official appointment, many Nigerians are in Europe and America on self-exile because of the security situation and intimidation in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of my uncles was a member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), which forced the military to resign. Today, many who were witch-hunted by the government and its security apparatuses are on self-exile. The fact is that their brothers and friends are part of the people in government, so who is going to force the ruling class to change; nobody because many are scared to lose their lives and investments,\u201d he said further.\n\nHe also observed that the media is being gagged, while those benefiting from the central are hero-worshipping their benefactors.\n\n\u201cThe situation is simply a change of name or mode of operation, but the realities are even worse than before 1999,\u201d he concluded.\n\nDecrying the current situation in the country, Yohana Dati, a serial entrepreneur, noted that the country has drifted further below the level it was in 1999.\n\n\u201cFrom the economy, security, peaceful co-existence, corruption, nepotism to other anti-development vices, we have gone from bad in 1999 to worse today, we have moved from grace to grass and from frying pan to furnace fire,\u201d the food commodity exporter lamented.\n\n\u201cBefore 1999, NADECO, mainly from the South West, was on Sani Abacha\u2019s neck, most were in exile fighting the military junta to cede power to civilians. Sadly today, many who do not want to be intimidated by the DSS or Police are going on self-exile in the name of relocation abroad. But, ask yourself, who wants to be in this country where cattle is valued more than human lives. In the last seven years, I have been losing my relatives to herdsmen and gunmen and will lose more because the government does not care about those killed,\u201d Dati decried.\n\nConsidering that the South West enjoyed sympathy in 1999 over the annulled June 12 election, resulting in the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as president, Chijoke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker, noted that the South East may not enjoy such sympathy as many have been clamoring that the zone has been marginalised and should be allowed to produce the next president in 2023.\n\nAccording to Umelahi, who is also an Abuja-based lawyer, the body language of the present administration does not signal that and the political parties, especially the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which the South East zone has been supporting since 1999, is opening the presidential ticket to all candidates across the country, heightening the fears.\n\n\u201cSome of my learned colleagues say that the South West used NADECO to fight the military junta before 1999 and deserved to present the president then. But other zones were in the fight too, the Ogonis lost some of their illustrious sons, as well as the Igbos, Tivs, Effik among others. Today, the Igbos are fighting too, using the apparatus that they can obtain, despite some governors that are sellout. Are the killings in the East, intimidations by the security and menace of herdsmen not enough to consider them for presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, the sing song in society is that Nigeria has never had it so bad.\n\nThere is the perception that President Buhari has not done enough to unite the country; rather he has directly or indirectly fuelled ethnic division through glaring sectional policies, pronouncements and legislations which have pitched one section of the country against another.\n\nAyo Ogunjimi, a public affairs analyst, urged Nigerians to take their destiny in their own hands and make the needed change they want at the ballot.\n\n\u201cI agree the country is in a bad state, but it is up to us to vote and make that change in 2023. I think the situation now is different from 1999 where we were just returning to democracy after years of military rule, where there was not much confidence in the electoral system; in fact, a lot of people refused to vote, and some politicians avoided the transition process for fear the military would not hand it over.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the South-East would get such sympathy this time, I don\u2019t even think the ruling party would pick its presidential candidate from the region, because the party barely exists there. Maybe they have more chances in PDP, but I agree they should be allowed to rule for equity and justice sake,\u201d Ogunjimi said.\n\nSimilarly, Kunle Okunade, political commentator, said the South-East should not believe the presidency would be handed over to them on a platter of gold, stressing that they need to position themselves, strategies and lobby other interest geopolitical zones.\n\nHe added that it would be difficult for the South-East to enjoy the sympathy and political grace the South-West enjoyed in 1999 because the circumstances are different.\n\n\u201cPolitics is all struggles for political power among interests and so, no interest will want to easily relinquish power or allow power shift. That is to say, the South-East should not believe the presidency would be handed over to them on a platter of gold. They need to position themselves, strategies deeper, lobby other interest geopolitical zones, negotiate power with both centripetal and centrifugal forces in the country and push forward a unified candidate.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHowever, it might be hard for the South-East to enjoy the sympathy and political grace the South-West enjoyed in 1999 because the circumstances are different. The political drama of the pre and post 1993 era was part of what paved the way for a South-West president in 1999. It was never as a result of any marginalisation as it is with the South-East.\n\n\u201cOn whether the 2023 general election would be fair as in 1993, this can\u2019t be given an exact answer because candidates of the political parties truly emerged from the party not imposed on the party because of money. Unlike what we have right now, where the provisions in the Electoral Acts are not duly followed.\n\n\u201cWhat I know is that the fairest of elections in this contemporary would be determined by how effective and efficient the provisions of the Electoral Act are followed by all stakeholders.\u201d",

          "text": "Should you be worried about Omicron, new covid variant?\n\nThe new Omicron coronavirus variant \u2013 identified first in South Africa, but also detected in Europe and Asia \u2013 is raising concern worldwide given the number of mutations, which might help it spread or even evade antibodies from prior infection or vaccination.\n\nNews of the variant prompted countries to announce new travel restrictions on Friday and sent drug makers scrambling to see if their COVID-19 vaccines remain protective. These countries introducing ban on flights include the UK which said Saturday that two cases of Omicron have been found there. Even African countries are now banning flights from South Africa.\n\nWHY ARE SCIENTISTS WORRIED?\n\nThe World Health Organization on Friday classified the B.1.1.529 variant, or Omicron, as a SARS-CoV-2 \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d saying it may spread more quickly than other forms of coronavirus.\n\nThe Delta variant remains dominant worldwide, accounting for 99.9% of U.S. cases, and it is not yet clear whether Omicron will be able to displace Delta, said Dr. Graham Snyder, medical director, infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nBut the new variant has over 30 mutations in the part of the virus that current vaccines target. It is also suspected of driving a spike in new infections in South Africa.\n\nOmicron\u2019s mutations are likely to render certain COVID-19 treatments \u2013 including some manufactured antibodies \u2013 ineffective, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University.\n\nExperimental antiviral pills \u2013 such as Pfizer Inc\u2019s (PFE.N) Paxlovid and Merck & Co Inc\u2019s (MRK.N) molnupiravir \u2013 target parts of the virus that are not changed in Omicron, and these drugs could become even more important if vaccine-induced and natural immunity are threatened.\n\nTHE UNKNOWNS\n\nScientists say it could be several more weeks before they can define the type of disease caused by the variant, determine how contagious it is and identify how far it has already spread.\n\nSome note that other variants of concern, including Beta, which was also first detected in South Africa, were ultimately replaced by Delta.\n\nBut the biggest question remains whether protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 nearly 8 billion doses have been administered globally \u2013 will hold up. And, will people previously infected with the coronavirus be immune from infection with Omicron?\n\nExperts also don\u2019t yet know whether Omicron will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other coronavirus strains.\n\nBEST RESPONSE?\n\nOmicron has not yet been identified in the United States, but it is likely already here, scientists said.\n\nEven without the new variant, U.S. COVID-19 rates have increased in recent weeks, mainly in northern states, as people move indoors to avoid winter weather.\n\nSome countries have moved to limit travel from southern Africa. Beyond government restrictions, individuals should still assess their own vulnerability to COVID and tolerance for risk as they make travel decisions for the winter holidays, Snyder from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said.\n\nHe and others said vaccination should remain a priority despite questions about effectiveness against Omicron, because it is likely that they still remain protective to a certain extent. Everyone should also continue to wear masks, avoid crowds, ventilate rooms, and wash hands.\n\n\u201cWe have all those tools that will work against any variant,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.",

If we do not do something about controlling our population growth, there will be a huge gap between our capacity to narrow the growth rate and our development.\n\n\u201cYes, we could turn the 200 million-plus people we have today into a huge economic asset if we manage that growth. If we don\u2019t and allow it to grow without proper planning, we will continue to play catch-up for decades to come.\n\n\u201cFor us in government, it is a big risk that we must now begin to address and put our acts together. We believe in what you are doing. From that start point, we believe in what you are doing and will need guidance and support on how to make sure that this issue becomes prominent on the agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s not taking the place it needs to take in our conversations about our development.

It is about capacity, education and health, which is at the base. We have strengthened our basic education. The kids are now learning, our teachers are motivated and there are significant outcomes in our learning process.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing the same model in our healthcare space. Thank you so much for the push for vaccine manufacturing. It is so important. As a country, we must build our capacity. The pandemic will be with us for a while. We can\u2019t continue to be dependent.\n\n\u201cWe need help to carry out our own subnational census. We just commenced a 30-year planning process. We cannot do socio-economic planning, as well as our physical and urban planning without data. While working on the national population census, we also have to commence our own census with our planning process,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nEarlier, the UN under Secretary-General and Executive Director, UNPF, Dr. Natalia Kanem, commended the governor for establishing a special court for prosecuting offenders of gender-based violence in the state.\n\n...",

About a year ago, I had the honour of opening one of their flagship stores in Lagos State and a remarkable architectural piece in Lekki where they sell only agricultural produce.\u201d\n\nOutlining the gains of commissioning the cashew factory in the state, the governor said, \u201cFirst, you will recall that as a government, we said we are going to create jobs for our people and made it clear that it is not the government that creates the jobs but the private sector. But for them to create these jobs successfully, the government must support them, create the enabling environment and help them reduce risks to make profits and ensure that their businesses are sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSecondly, the government identified the areas the jobs will come from, and on top of the list is agriculture. We are very pleased with the bold step and initiative Farmforte has taken in the state.\n\n\u201cThirdly, my administration will continue to encourage more investments in Edo State as investment does well here because it is a state of the progressives. Investments here are protected by the people themselves. I encourage younger men and women to come into agriculture as there are immense opportunities in the sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwith the facility in the state, the government will encourage farmers in Edo North and other areas where cashew is grown to farm and harvest the fruits, while the nuts will be processed.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cThe key risk is to get enough cashew seeds. We would like to work with you as a government to encourage our farmers with improved seeds and off-take agreements to encourage them to cultivate and grow more. I would like to work with you to build capacity and encourage farmers to grow cash crops as you will give them a price for their produce.\n\n\u201cWe want Edo to be number one when it comes to cashew production. It is just one of the many products that we will be supporting because it has an easy market. We are proud of what you are doing here in the state, as we encourage more young people to be enterprising. My administration is ready to continue to support you as you do your businesses and grow wealth.\u201d\n\nThe Co-Chief Executive Officer, Farmforte, Mr. Osazuwa Osayi said the facility will produce 5,400 metric tons of cashew per annum, noting that the produce will be processed in the factory in Edo State and will positively affect between 2,000 to 3,000 smallholder farmers that grow cashew in the state.\n\n...",

          "title": "THE 3,906 INMATES STILL ON THE RUN AND AREGBESOLA \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe attacks on military formations and correctional facilities do not mean that the ministers of defence and interior have abandoned their duties. Those that abandoned more than 25 armoured tanks purchased by Aregbesola in Osun are accusing the minister of abandoning his duty at the ministry of interior. I want to put the records straight that the rehabilitation and upgrading of correctional centres have not been included in Nigerian budgets since 2015.\n\nIf resources are made available today, Rauf Aregbesola will rehabilitate and upgrade correctional facilities to meet 21st century standard across Nigeria to prevent future jailbreaks. Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior has ambition plans for the upgrade and rehabilitation of correctional facilities across the states to prevent future jailbreaks. Recently, the committee on appropriations was mandated by House of Representatives to include the rehabilitation and upgrade of the correctional centres in the 2022 budget estimates. The House noted with concern the recent cases of jailbreaks, saying that it was dangerous for such convicted criminals to be let loose. It was concerned that if adequate steps were not taken to re-arrest the escaped convicts and provide adequate security in correctional centres, some of the criminals who escaped may become more emboldened to the point of forming terrorist groups that would put the country in jeopardy.\n\nAregbesola has plans to rehabilitate and upgrade the Correctional Centres with latest and sophisticated arms such as GPMG and automatic machine guns and other security electric fence wires attached with shocking gadgets and highly sophisticated CCTV Cameras provided there is budgetary provision.\n\nThe federal government has disclosed that it would establish six new modern custodial facilities in the six geo-political zones in the country. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, disclosed this in Kano while inspecting the ongoing model maximum security custodial facility project at Janguza in Kumbotso Local Government Area of the state. Aregbesola said the project was part of projects initiated by the federal government to reform the correctional service. A shift to prioritizing rehabilitation programs would address the root cause of crime and lead to an overall more effective prison system that discourages people from recommitting crimes. Thus, it is important to focus on implementing policies that would prevent inmates from engaging in criminal acts once released. As it stands now, the current correctional system is doing a horrendous job: over 75 percent of released inmates are re-incarcerated within five years of discharge from prison. Thus, it is clear that punishment is ineffective. Prioritizing and strengthening rehabilitation programs would prepare inmates to be better members of society and be less likely to commit crimes again. There are various programs that have been implemented that have shown tremendous success. He said: \u201cWe are actualising our commitment to reform the correctional service that we have in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Aregbesola, \u201cWhat we have here is a model of what we expect to have nationwide. Here, we have a 3,000 custodial facility, which we plan to replicate in each of the six geo-political zones in the country. \u201cIt is designed for inmates awaiting trial, a petty, medium and maximum security facility,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAregbesola, who has expressed satisfaction with the project, commended President Buhari for his support to the correctional service reforms aimed at enhancing its operations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Controller-General, Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS), Mr Ahmad Jafaru said that the project was designed with court, dormitories, school, hospital, skills acquisition centre and a mosque, among others. He said the project would be commissioned this year, adding that the ancient Kurmawa Maximum Prison had been upgraded into a rehabilitation centre.\n\nRECENTLY, the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, made a statement over the frightening attack on correctional centres across the country. He declared that no fewer than 3,906 inmates were still on the run after a number of jailbreaks in parts of the country, but that the Federal Government had the capacity and wherewithal to recapture the fleeing inmates, including convicted hardened criminals. \u201cHow long can they continue to run from the state? The state is a patient bird. You can run, but you can\u2019t hide. We have their biometrics; whenever and wherever they appear to transact business, their cover will be blown,\u201d he said.\n\nThere have been at least eight jailbreaks in the last one year, and a large proportion of the inmates remain on the run. This scenario speaks volumes about the performance of the Federal Government in ensuring the general security of life and property in the country. Between 2017 and July this year, at least 4,307 inmates were believed to have escaped from correctional centres. In 2021 alone, more than 2000 inmates were freed in two jailbreaks. The figures included 240 inmates that were freed after gunmen invaded a detention facility in Kogi State with explosives in September 2021. On April 5, about 2000 inmates were freed in Imo State when gunmen blew up a correctional facility and later attacked the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police command and freed a number of suspects. There were also cases of attempted jailbreaks at the Ikoyi Correctional Centre in Lagos State and a similar facility in Bauchi State, as well as Ubiaja in Edo State.\n\nAccording to Aregbesola, biometrics of all inmates in the country has been captured, and it is the hope of the Federal Government that this exercise will aid the tracking and re-arrest of the escapees. The former governor of Osun State stressed that the recent attacks on some correctional facilities in the country are a reflection of the insecurity in Nigeria. He explained that the government is on the trail of some of the attackers with a couple of them arrested in Imo State. The minister assured Nigerians that a ministerial task force will soon be inaugurated to enforce the re-arrest of all escapees and their collaborators.\n\nAregbesola\u2019s comments come a few weeks after gunmen attacked the Medium Security Custodial Centre in the Abolongo area of Oyo State with an unconfirmed number of inmates escaping from the facility. A few hours after the siege, the Federal Government said operatives had recaptured some of the inmates. The Interior Minister in his reaction to the incident assured Nigerians that \u201cthe Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody\u201d.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes via inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\n...",

          "text": "The shooting to death of Miss Chidimma Ezeanochie, 20, of Umudansu Village, Azia Community in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra has generated arguments between the Police and the Community.\n\nChidinma was shot to death on Nov. 25 when while running an errand for her mother in the company of her 14-year-old brother.\n\nThe community in a petition to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, accused the police of directly shooting the girl at close range while her brother escaped narrowly.\n\nThe police have refuted the allegation, however.\n\nThe petition is entitled: \u201cGruesome murder of Miss Chidimma Ezeanochie by policemen of Special Unit deployed from Awka to Orsumoghu on Nov. 25, 2021\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2013\n\nIt is signed by Dr Tonna Nwabueze, President-General of Azia General Assembly.\n\nThe community described the murder as gruesome, wicked and totally unacceptable to it and demanded for justice from the police hierarchy.\n\nAccording to the petition, Chidimma and her brother were shot at close range by a team member of the Special Unit from inside an armoured vehicle.\n\n\u201cFortunately the brother was spared, but the bullet scattered our daughter\u2019s head with the brain matter on the ground.\n\n\u201cShe died instantly. It\u2019s quite unimaginable because there was no form of provocation that could be linked to this.\n\n\u201cPresently her body is deposited at a hospital morgue at Okija, Anambra.\n\n\u201cAbout 100 meters from the site of this incident, the police equally opened fire on a Sienna Space Bus parked by a block industry.\n\n\u201cWe contacted the Area Commander of the police on this and he told us that the policemen are a Special Unit from Awka deployed in Orsumoghu against the proscribed Independent Peoples of Biafra boys,\u2019\u2019 it stated.\n\nReacting to the petition, however, the police in Anambra condoled with the family of Miss Chidimma, but exonerated themselves from her murder.\n\nIn a statement signed by DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, Police Public Relations Officer, the police denied the community\u2019s claim.\n\nIkenga stated that earlier on that day, a police escort team consisting of seven policemen and three civilian drivers traveling through Azia/Osumoghu Road was ambushed by some armed men.\n\nHe added that two police officers were killed in the attack and their bodies burnt while one of the officers was still missing.\n\nAccording to him, the peddlers of the misinformation about Chidinma\u2019s death anchored their claims on the fact that they saw an Armoured Personnel Carrier passing through Azia/Osumoghu junction when the alleged incident happened.\n\n\u201cThe police rescue team on arrival at Azia/Osumoghu junction came under indiscriminate shooting with Improvised Explosive Devices thrown at their vehicles by hoodlums who earlier attacked a police escort team.\n\n\u201cPolice operatives repelled the attack and recovered two earlier stolen rifles belonging to the police; throughout the operation, no innocent citizen, talk less of children were sighted in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, a surprise to hear about the death of an innocent lady who may have been killed by the indiscriminate firing by the insurgents,\u2019\u2019 Ikenga stated.\n\nIkenga added that Mr Echeng Echeng, the Commissioner of Police in Anambra was saddened by the incident and extended his hearty condolences to the bereaved family.\n\nEcheng assured that the police, in synergy with sister security forces and host communities, would work to put an end to insecurity in that part of the state and ensure that such incidents did not reoccur.

It\u2019s quite unimaginable because there was no form of provocation that could be linked to this.\n\n\u201cPresently her body is deposited at a hospital morgue at Okija, Anambra.\n\n\u201cAbout 100 meters from the site of this incident, the police equally opened fire on a Sienna Space Bus parked by a block industry.\n\n\u201cWe contacted the Area Commander of the police on this and he told us that the policemen are a Special Unit from Awka deployed in Orsumoghu against the proscribed Independent Peoples of Biafra boys,\u2019\u2019 it stated.\n\nReacting to the petition, however, the police in Anambra condoled with the family of Miss Chidimma, but exonerated themselves from her murder.\n\nIn a statement signed by DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, Police Public Relations Officer, the police denied the community\u2019s claim.\n\nIkenga stated that earlier on that day, a police escort team consisting of seven policemen and three civilian drivers traveling through Azia/Osumoghu Road was ambushed by some armed men.\n\nHe added that two police officers were killed in the attack and their bodies burnt while one of the officers was still missing.\n\nAccording to him, the peddlers of the misinformation about Chidinma\u2019s death anchored their claims on the fact that they saw an Armoured Personnel Carrier passing through Azia/Osumoghu junction when the alleged incident happened.\n\n\u201cThe police rescue team on arrival at Azia/Osumoghu junction came under indiscriminate shooting with Improvised Explosive Devices thrown at their vehicles by hoodlums who earlier attacked a police escort team.\n\n\u201cPolice operatives repelled the attack and recovered two earlier stolen rifles belonging to the police; throughout the operation, no innocent citizen, talk less of children were sighted in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, a surprise to hear about the death of an innocent lady who may have been killed by the indiscriminate firing by the insurgents,\u2019\u2019 Ikenga stated.\n\nIkenga added that Mr Echeng Echeng, the Commissioner of Police in Anambra was saddened by the incident and extended his hearty condolences to the bereaved family.\n\nEcheng assured that the police, in synergy with sister security forces and host communities, would work to put an end to insecurity in that part of the state and ensure that such incidents did not reoccur.

The negative effects will surely outweigh the positive.\n\n\u201cThe cost of transportation for human and goods across the country will skyrocket and other things connected which will have a spiral effect on general living standard of the populace; the suffering will be multi-dimensional.

In addition, in order to stem the rising cost of living, farmers and others connected to them should be encouraged. This is what can help our economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the PFN would always support policies that would enhance good governance, but charged the government to this effect to put in place tangible palliative measures that could ameliorate the hardship being experienced.\n\nHe said, \u201cWithout begging the issue, there should be well defined palliative measures in place that can cushion the effect of the hardship being experienced by Nigerians, especially the commoners. One is not talking about political palliatives that never last. We have seen enough of such.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the price of petroleum from its present N165 to N340 per litre can trigger tension and crises in the country which in turn can paralyse our economy if not handled with utmost care.\n\n\u201cAgain, the planned introduction of N5,000 for 40 million poor Nigerians is to create a cesspool of corruption. How do you define the poor? They, mostly, don\u2019t use telephones. They, mostly, don\u2019t have bank accounts. How will the money get to them?\u201d\n\nOke advised the government to be wary of policies that could jeopardize the conduct of the 2023 general elections, insisting that all hands must be geared towards steering the wheel of the country to safety.\n\nAs a panacea to the rising cost of food items, the PFN President advised that farmers and relevant stakeholders should be empowered with relevant tools and funds through loans with little interest.\n\nOke, who is also the presiding Bishop of The Sword of the Spirit Ministries, implored the government not to relent in its efforts at ensuring that security challenges in the country become a thing of the past.

          "text": "The Plateau state Medium Security Custodial Centre Jos Sunday came under attack by gunmen who reportedly stormed the facility in large number with sophisticated weapons.\n\nController of Corrections Public Relations Officer (PRO) Francis Enobore said this in a late night statement in Jos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe invaders were said to have arrived at the Custodial Centre at about 1720hrs and immediately made for the main gate where they engaged the armed squad personnel in a gun battle before breaking into the yard.\n\n\u201cAlthough they gained entrance to the yard, they are however trapped within as men from sister security services were immediately mobilised to assist the armed guards to cordon the perimeter wall and the entire area.\u201d\n\nEnobore further said reinforcement from the response squad of the Service was also mobilised to the centre.\n\nHe said \u201cthe situation is presently under control as the attackers firing power is being subdued by superior fire from a combined team of security agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpdate will be made available as event unfolds,\u201d the statement added.\n\nGani Adams on kidnappers\n\nIn a related development, Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland Gani Adams has raised the alarm over bandits relocating to both Kwara and Kogi states.\n\nAdams stated this weekend while speaking at the 2021 edition of Oya Festival in Ira, Kwara state.\n\nHe said the trend of insecurity in the two states was becoming disheartening and alarming.\n\nAdams said: \u201cGovernor AbdulRasak needs to provide adequate security for the people of the state as well as the visitors. The report that some of the bad elements, including bandits and kidnappers, have relocated to Kwara and Kogi states is alarming.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara State government needs to improve on the security situation in the state by using the Amotekun structure to combat the growing spate of insecurity in the state.\n\n\u201cThe success recorded in securing the South-west through Amotekun is encouraging and the security initiative is yielding positive outcome.\u201d\n\nGang leader killed\n\nAlso, Police special forces have killed a notorious kidnap gang leader, Yellow Magaji, after raiding their hideouts in Kaduna, just as military special forces killed the gang leader of last Sunday\u2019s attack on Kaduna-Abuja highway.\n\nThe bandits had terrorised Kaduna-Abuja highway in a spate of attacks killing a former FCDA Director, Alhaji Kabiru Hamidu and abducted several others Sunday and Monday.\n\nThey, however, met their waterloo when the military forces took the battle to their camps in the forest, killing their leader and several others.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Kaduna state, ASP Muhammed Jalige, said this on behalf of the Commissioner of Police Abdullahi Mudasiru.\n\nJalige said: \u201cOn November 24, 2021, operatives of the Kaduna Police Command in collaboration with the Federal Intelligence Bureau and Special Tactical Squad Force headquarters, Abuja, raided a facility at Ungwan Maijero area of Sabon Tasha in Chikun local government area of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cThe raid, which was on the directive of the Commissioner of Police, Mudassiru Abdullahi, acting on credible intelligence, was carried out against, a facility \u201cknown as Sir Joe Guest Inn located at NO.8 Sajo Street Unguwan Maigero area of Sabon Tasha in Chikun LGA of Kaduna state where a report of suspected bandits were said to have lodged.\n\n\u201cWhile the cautiously coordinated raid was ongoing, the suspected armed bandits on sensing danger took to their heels shooting sporadically leading to a gun duel with the operatives. One notorious bandit popularly called Yellow Magaji a.k.a Arushe was wounded in the shootout, whereas his equally notorious partner Yellow Ashana and others escaped with bullet wounds.\n\n\u201cThe wounded bandit, Yellow Magaji was among a syndicate of bandits terrorising Kaduna-Abuja highway of recent, was thereafter taken to Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital for possible resuscitation to obtain useful information but was confirmed dead on arrival by a medical doctor.\n\n\u201cAfter an extensive search of the scene, the operatives recovered one AK47 rifle loaded with 23 rounds of 7.62 X 39mm live ammunition, 14 expended shells and one Boxer motorcycle belonging to the bandits. The owner of the facility who harbours the criminals was equally arrested for questioning.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police salutes the courage of the operatives and most importantly the source of the valid information. He urged other members of the public to assist security operatives with prompt information as he assures them of absolute confidentiality while acting on the intel.\n\n\u201cThe CP urged law abiding citizens to be vigilant and security conscious of their immediate environment.\u201d\n\nMilitary neutralise bandits too\n\nMeanwhile, following the spate of attacks on Kaduna-Abuja highway, Military Special Forces chased dozens of bandits terrorising the highway, including leader of last Sunday attack on the highway to their hideouts in Kaduna forests and killed them.\n\nThe onslaught on the bandits and kidnappers, according to sources, led to the killing of the leader of the bandits, who killed former Director of the FCT and abducted his police orderly and many others on the highway last Sunday, and several other bandits during a fierce battle between the Special Forces and the bandits.\n\nCombat ready security agents were seen on motorbikes and other vehicles; heading to the forests in search of more bandits to neutralise as security agents takes the battle to the bandits, further into their hideouts.\n\nZaria LG workers freed\n\nAnd also from the Kaduna state Police Command came the cherry news that 10 out of the 13 abducted staff of the Zaria local government council have been released.\n\nPolice image maker in the state, ASP Jalige told journalists Sunday in Zaria that the kidnapped staff were released Saturday, adding that efforts were on to ensure the release of the remaining three victims.\n\nHowever, the PPRO declined comment on whether ransom was paid to secure the release the abducted staff.\n\nDirector, Education and Social Development, Mrs Deborah Mugu, her deputy, Dalhatu Aliyu-Awai, and 11 other staff members of Zaria local government were abducted by gunmen.\n\nThe staff was abducted at Kidandan, Giwa local government Kaduna state, on their way for a condolence visit to Dogara Abdullahi, a staff, who lost his father.\n\nA family source who craved anonymity, said the staff members were released after payment of N40m ransom to the kidnappers.\n\nHe added that family members of the victims contributed money to pay the ransom.\n\nHe added that the kidnappers did not release three of the abducted staff because some conditions for the release was N40m and three brand new motorcycles.\n\n\u201cOnly the money that was taken to them, that is why they refused to release the three staff.\n\n\u201cThe freed victims are yet to be united with their families because they were taken to an undisclosed hospital for medical examination,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWhen contacted, chairman, Zaria local government, Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim, said he cannot add anything to what the family source told NAN.\n\nAsked whether the council would provide the new motorcycle to get the three remaining staff released, Ibrahim said: \u201cFall back to your source.\u201d (NAN)\n\nArms supplier in Zamfara\n\nSimilarly, Zamfara state police command tactical operatives in collaboration with FIB/STS led by DSP Hussaini Gimba, arrested 30- year-old woman, Fatima Lawali in Gusau, the state capital, for allegedly supplying arms to bandits.\n\nCommissioner of Police Ayuba N. Elkana announced this at a press conference in Gusauu.\n\nHe said the suspect was arrested at Gada Biyu area under Bungudu local government.\n\nElkana said: \u201cOn 25th October, 2021 at about 0930hrs, Police Tactical Operatives of the Command in collaboration with FIB/STS led by DSP Hussaini Gimba has succeeded in the arrest of Fatima Lawali, who is suspected in supplying ammunition to armed bandits in the state.\n\n\u201cExhibit recovered from her was 991 rounds of Ak-47 live ammunition from Dabagi in Sokoto state to be delivered to a notorious bandit\u2019s kingpin Ado Alero who has been terrorizing Zamfara state and other neighboring states.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with journalists, the suspect confessed to the crime, saying she was given the sum of N50, 000 for the first time and N30,000 for the second time before she was arrested by the police in Gusau.\n\nThe suspect also revealed she was sent by one Sama\u2019ila who is among the notorious bandit commanders from Zamfara to Gada local government in Sokoto state with the 991 live ammunition before she was arrested by the police in Gusau.\n\nCP Ayuba stated that investigation into the matter was still in progress ahead further legal action against the suspect.\n\nThe CP said the command also arrested 29-year-old Bello Mu\u2019azu in a case of attempted raping of 4-year-old girl, Aisha Buhari in Talata Mafara, headquarters of Talata Mafara local government area of the state.\n\n\u201cOn the 24th November, 2021 at about 1500hrs, a complaint was received by the Police in T/Mafara LGA against the above mentioned suspect, that on the same date about 1400hrs, a good Samaritan sighted the suspect with the victim in a tight corner trying to remove her cloth and rape her, raised an alarm that led to the arrest of the suspect and brought him to the Station\u201d. CP Ayuba said.\n\nBandits as terrorists\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has described the declaration of bandits, Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019ada as terrorists by Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court Abuja as long overdue.\n\nFollowing an Ex-parte Motion filed by the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Justice, the Abuja-based court declared bandits as terrorists after years of debate among Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike.\n\nSpeaking on the development in a statement obtained by Blueprint in Abuja Sunday, the northern youth urged the Armed Forces and other sister security agencies to arrest and prosecute those identifying with terrorists materially, morally or otherwise no matter how highly or lowly placed.\n\nThe group\u2019s statement was signed by its President and Director General, Media and Publicity, Comrade Isah Abubakar and Mock Samuel Kure respectively.\n\n\u201cThough it almost took the Federal Government forever to act on the calls made by various interest groups in the Country, including the Northern Youth Council to declare bandits terrorists, it however better late than never\n\n\u201cWe will welcome full military operation in North-western and North-central parts of the Country as it is happening in Northeast against Boko Haram and ISWAP elements which has drastically reduced their activities,\u201d they said.",

          "title": "COVID-19 Omicron: WHO cautions on travel bans targeting Africa, rising concerns over spread in UK, EU countries",
          "text": "Putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said through its regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti.\n\nMs Moeti, in a statement Sunday evening, said travel restrictions may play a role in slightly reducing the spread of COVID-19 but place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWith the Omicron variant now detected in several regions of the world, putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity. COVID-19 constantly exploits our divisions. We will only get the better of the virus if we work together for solutions,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ms Moeti, \u201cif restrictions are implemented, they should not be unnecessarily invasive or intrusive, and should be scientifically based, according to the International Health Regulations which is a legally binding instrument of international law recognized by over 190 nations.\u201d\n\nShe commended the transparency of South African and Botswana adding that they shared life-saving public health information.\n\n\u201cThe speed and transparency of the South African and Botswana governments in informing the world of the new variant is to be commended. WHO stands with African countries which had the courage to boldly share life-saving public health information, helping protect the world against the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week, nations will be joining a special session of the World Health Assembly, organised by WHO to discuss how to collectively prepare and respond better to pandemics, building on their commitments to the International Health Regulations,\u201d the official said.\n\nShe urged all countries to respect their legal obligations and implement scientifically based public health actions, adding, \u201cIt is critical that countries which are open with their data are supported as this is the only way to ensure we receive important data in a timely manner.\n\n\u201cWhile investigations continue into the Omicron variant, WHO recommends countries to take a risk-based and scientific approach and put in place measures which can limit its possible spread. Flight bans have been imposed on southern African countries, but so far only two have detected the new variant. Meanwhile, countries in other regions have reported cases of Omicron.\u201d\n\nWHO said it is scaling up support to genomic sequencing in Africa. Sequencing laboratories should have access to adequate human resources and testing reagents to work at full capacity, the statement read.\n\n\u201cWHO is ready to support the additional human resource needs as well as mobilise funds and technical expertise to reinforce COVID-19 response activities including surveillance, treatment and infection prevention and community engagement in southern African countries.\u201d\n\nThe global health agency urged countries to take key steps to enhance efforts to track the Omicron variant, including ensuring their PCR testing equipment can detect it, increasing their sampling and sequencing of COVID-19 test samples by at least double to 150 samples a week from the current average of 75, and review past sequencing samples for potential signs of Omicron.\n\nIn September 2020, WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a network of 12 laboratories to reinforce genome sequencing of the virus. Genomic surveillance has advanced significantly since the start of 2021, with the continent recording a five-fold increase in the number of genomes sequenced.\n\nTravel restrictions\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how countries moved to restrict travels from southern African countries following the emergence of the new variant.\n\nThis newspaper also reported that the Africa CDC frowned at the restrictions. It noted that over the duration of the pandemic, it has observed that imposing bans on travellers from countries where a new variant is reported has not yielded a meaningful outcome.\n\nThe new variant: B.1.1.529\n\nOn November 25, 2021, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa announced the detection of a new variant of the SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, following genomic sequencing. This variant is currently labelled as lineage B.1.1.529.\n\nThe emergence of this new variant coincided with a sudden increase in cases in the Gauteng province of South Africa and was, accordingly, closely monitored by the health authorities in the country.\n\nIt was detected in 77 samples collected between November 12 and 20 from Gauteng Province, four samples from Botswana and one sample in Hong Kong.\n\nThe B.1.1.529 variant, later named Omicron by the WHO, displays multiple mutations across the virus genome, which encodes the spike protein responsible for virus entry into host cells.\n\nSome of the mutations have been detected in previous variants, such as Alpha and Delta, and have been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion.\n\nMany of the other identified mutations are not yet well characterised and have not been identified in other currently circulating variants.\n\nMore investigations are underway to determine the possible impact of these mutations on the capacity of the virus to transmit more efficiently, to impact vaccine effectiveness and evade immune response, and/or to cause more severe or milder disease.\n\nConcerns in UK, EU countries\n\nAnd following the discovery of two cases of the super-mutant Omicron Coronavirus variant in the UK, European countries have been put on red alert with the detection of the new variant in Belgium, Botswana, Hong Kong, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Israel, sparking global concern and a rush to ban travel.\n\nA report Sunday by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Omicron, the new potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus has been reported in more European countries after the UK, just days after being identified in South Africa.\n\nMany countries have already imposed travel restrictions on flights from southern Africa amid fears that Omicron variant has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by available vaccines.\n\nBut experts say such restrictions may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally\n\nCountries are now on high alert even as the coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of more than five million people around the world.\n\nIn Czech Republic, the spokesperson of a regional hospital in the northern Czech city of Liberec confirmed the new Omicron strain in a woman.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues from the department of genetics and molecular diagnostics confirmed the strain with 90-per cent probability after a sequence analysis.\u201d\n\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said the woman visited Namibia and flew back to the Czech Republic via South Africa and Dubai.\n\n\u201cThe woman was vaccinated and had mild symptoms of the disease,\u201d Babis added.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to compel President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the arrest of security operatives involved in the shooting of peaceful #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki tollgate, and police brutality cases.\n\nYoung Nigerians had converged at the Lekki tollgate on October 20, 2020, demanding good governance in the country and an end to police brutality before they were reportedly shot at by security operatives.\n\nA year after, a leaked report by the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry on police brutality set up by the state government to probe the incident had indicted the officers for shooting \u201cunarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification.\u201d\n\nBut SERAP in a statement on Sunday by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, said the lawsuit was filed in collaboration with 116 concerned Nigerians.\n\nREAD ALSO: Lekki Toll Gate: Army \u2018Killed Unarmed, Defenseless Protesters\u2019 \u2013 Lagos Panel\n\nThe group wants the court to \u201cdirect and compel President Muhammadu Buhari to take immediate steps to ensure the arrest of soldiers and police officers indicted by the Lagos #EndSARS panel report for the shooting of peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll-gate, and police brutality cases.\u201d\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1482/2021 filed last Friday, SERAP is also asking the court to \u201cdirect and compel President Buhari to bring to justice anyone suspected to be responsible for the shooting of peaceful protesters, and to ensure access to justice and effective remedies for victims, including adequate compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application, as it would improve respect for Nigerians\u2019 rights, the rule of law, and public confidence in government institutions, as well as reduce the growing culture of impunity of perpetrators,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe safety of protesters in Nigeria remains as precarious as ever, and impunity for crimes against them is growing. Impunity emboldens perpetrators. A failure to bring to justice those indicted for the shooting of peaceful protesters is, in itself, a violation of the rights to life and human dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe flagrant lack of accountability for past violations of the rights of protesters has given rise to a growing sense of powerlessness, and resentment not only among victims and their families but among the general public.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, the failure to promptly arrest, and bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for the shooting of peaceful protesters, and to ensure access to justice and effective remedies for victims and their families amounts to a travesty of justice, as justice delayed is justice denied.\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondent is the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN.\n\nWhile seeking an order to compel Buhari to ensure that those still being detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights are immediately and unconditionally released, and all charges against them are dropped, SERAP also wants the President to ensure full and effective respect for the human rights of everyone across the country, including the rights to life, dignity, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cThe Buhari administration has the constitutional responsibility to allow victims of human rights violations to find out the truth in regard to acts committed, to know who the perpetrators of such acts are, and to obtain justice and adequate compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right to life is an inherent, core, and non-derogable human right, regardless of the circumstances, and even in times of armed conflict or states of emergency. Summary, extrajudicial, or arbitrary executions are clearly prohibited under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and international law.\n\n\u201cThe UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary, and Summary Executions affirm that \u2018extra-legal, arbitrary, and summary executions\u2019 cannot be carried out under any circumstances.\u2019\n\n\u201cAccording to the principles, \u2018governments shall prohibit orders from superior officers or public authorities authorizing or inciting other persons to carry out any such extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions. All persons shall have the right and the duty to defy such orders.\u2019\n\n\u201cInternational law requires that the use of lethal force, such as firearms, is an \u2018extreme measure\u2019 that should only be considered when strictly necessary in order to protect life or prevent serious injury from an imminent threat.\n\n\u201cArticles 2(1) and 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party require State Parties to \u2018undertake to respect and ensure\u2019 and provide effective remedies for violations of the rights in the Covenant.\n\n\u201cThe remedies must be accessible and effective remedies and take into account the special vulnerability of certain categories of person.\n\n\u201cThe General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a set of principles relating to states\u2019 obligations to the victims of serious violations of international human rights law that makes clear that states are obligated to investigate violations of international human rights law thoroughly and impartially, and where appropriate, take action against those allegedly responsible.\n\n\u201cStates also have the duty to investigate and, if there is sufficient evidence, the duty to submit to prosecution the person allegedly responsible for violations.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has a constitutional duty, being the Chief Executive Officer of the Federation and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, to ensure access to justice and effective remedies for victims, and that there is no impunity for allegations of human rights violations.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the submission of the Lagos #EndSARS panel report on the Lekki shooting incident and police brutality cases to the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The leaked report is said to have indicted some soldiers and police officers for \u201cthe shooting of protesters, leading to grievous injuries and deaths.\n\nThe panel reportedly found that \u201cthe shooting of protesters at the Lekki toll-gate on October 20, 2020, was unwarranted, excessive, provocative and unjustifiable in the circumstances of the state of the protests, which was peaceful and orderly.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

They had to do C-section for her and she still lost one of her children.\u2019 That is so traumatising.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old singer said she wanted to start the campaign so women would understand they were \u201cnot alone\u201d in their struggles \u2013 it coincided with the release of her new song Woman.\n\nBut the flood of women who jumped on the hashtag to share their experiences of sexism and discrimination both in their careers and personal lives was a surprise.\n\nA photo of Simi with the words: \u201cHow can she ask for that kind of money, is she not pregnant?\u201d painted on her back started it all rolling.\n\nAs a famous artist in Africa and beyond, Simi said it summed up the sexism she had faced within her own industry of Afro music.\n\nAt the start of her career music bosses \u2013 usually men \u2013 told her she had to be \u201csexy\u201d and provocative to make it in her field.\n\nShe ignored them.\n\nWhen she made it big anyway, they were shocked.\n\nThere were even people who did not want to work with women, because they thought they could not function after having children or getting married, she said.\n\nIn one incident she recalled how someone questioned why she charged so much for concert tickets while she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cIt was probably an agency,\u201d she said, when asked who the culprit was.\n\nNollywood actress Chioma Omeruah \u2013 famously known as Chigul \u2013 has witnessed similar struggles and believes the problem is cultural.\n\n\u201cOur culture is not to speak out,\u201d the 45-year-old star told the BBC.\n\nShe took part in #NobodyLikeWoman with a photo along with the caption: \u201cMy friend! Go and have a child.\u201d\n\nChigul does not have any children, but that has not stopped friends and even trolls asking when she is going to have a baby.\n\nThose close to her may have meant well, but it still hurt, she said.\n\nDuring her career, Chigul said she has had countless numbers of up-and-coming actresses confide in her about alleged sexual misbehaviour by powerful male film bosses.\n\nSome of them were told by the male directors: \u201cCome and sleep with me, I\u2019ll make you a star. I can get you that part, that role\u201d \u2013 which she says amounts to coercion.\n\nOne actress she knows who refused to engage in sexual relations with a male film boss was reprimanded, she said.\n\nHe called her a \u201cchild\u201d with little understanding of \u201cadult\u201d business.\n\nWhen asked how many young actresses had confided in her about sexual coercion, she said it was \u201ctoo many\u201d.\n\nThe odds were stacked against women \u2013 the majority of the time they became the victims, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just wahala [trouble] on every level,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Chigul and Simi agree that the laws in Nigeria need to be tougher on those who discriminate against or attack women.\n\nAccording to UN Women, Nigeria has implemented 75% of laws needed to advance gender equality \u2013 which the UN wants to achieve worldwide by 2030.\n\nBut less than half the measures needed to monitor the country\u2019s progress towards that goal were in place by last year \u2013 for example the collection of regular statistics on things like the gender pay gap and physical and sexual harassment.\n\nNigerian women\u2019s rights lawyer and YouTube vlogger Sotonye Kelechi-Nwuzi says religion is often to blame.\n\nIn her opinion, Nigeran lawmakers tend to take into account how different faith communities will react to gender equality legislation.\n\nMrs Kelechi-Nwuzi, who is a Christian herself, says this is problematic.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a way to separate secular society from religious and cultural society I feel like there will be some progress,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nThe \u201cMeToo\u201d movement went viral in 2017 and encouraged people to share experiences of sexual harassment and assault\n\nShe also places some of the blame at the feet of the Nigerian police.\n\nMost of the cases Mrs Kelechi-Nwuzi covers as part of her women\u2019s rights work involve domestic violence, which the authorities do not take seriously, she says.\n\n\u201cOften times you\u2019ll find people quoting the Bible\u201d in an attempt to justify a husband\u2019s violence towards his wife, she says.\n\n#NobodyLikeWoman posts tend to be tame compared to the #MeToo movement which swept the world a few years ago when women \u2013 especially in Hollywood \u2013 started naming those who had allegedly sexually abused them.\n\nMrs Kelechi-Nwuzi says there could be a #MeToo movement in Nigeria one day, but it would require a woman to lead it who could withstand the vitriol and \u201cbacklash\u201d that would come with it.\n\nHowever, Simi believes the fight for women\u2019s rights in Africa cannot be compared with efforts in the West.\n\nThe situation for women in Africa is much worse because of what she describes as its patriarchal system: \u201cIt expects the woman to cower and to absorb oppression.\u201d\n\nChigul agrees \u2013 given that she says Nigerian women are taught to \u201csweep things under the rug\u201d.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "South Africa has complained it is being punished \u2013 instead of applauded \u2013 for discovering Omicron, a concerning new variant of Covid-19.\n\nThe foreign ministry made the statement as countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa as details of the spread emerged.\n\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that the new variant was \u201cof concern\u201d.\n\nSeveral cases have now been identified in Europe \u2013 two in the UK, two in Germany, one in Belgium and another one in Italy, while a suspected case was found in the Czech Republic.\n\nIsrael, where the new variant has been confirmed, has decided to ban all foreigners from entering the country from midnight Sunday.\n\nThe measure will last for 14 days, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nOmicron cases have also been detected in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel.\n\nHundreds of passengers arriving in the Netherlands from South Africa are being tested for the new variant.\n\nSome 61 people on two KLM flights were positive for Covid-19 and have been quarantined at a hotel near Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport while they have further tests, Dutch officials said.\n\nThe Netherlands is currently struggling with a record-breaking surge in cases. An extended partial lockdown comes into force there on Sunday evening.\n\nThe new Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November.\n\nA statement by the South African foreign ministry on Saturday strongly criticised the travel bans.\n\n\u201cExcellent science should be applauded and not punished,\u201d it said.\n\nThe bans were \u201cakin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the reaction had been completely different when new variants were discovered elsewhere in the world.\n\nAn African Union official told the BBC developed countries were to blame for the emergence of the variant.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on right now is inevitable, it\u2019s a result of the world\u2019s failure to vaccinate in an equitable, urgent and speedy manner. It is as a result of hoarding [of vaccines] by high-income countries of the world, and quite frankly it is unacceptable,\u201d said AU vaccine delivery alliance co-chair Ayoade Alakija.\n\n\u201cThese travel bans are based in politics, and not in science. It is wrong\u2026 Why are we locking away Africa when this virus is already on three continents?\u201d\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, a number of countries announced new measures:\n\nTravellers from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho and Eswatini will not be able to enter the UK unless they are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents.\n\nUS officials said foreigners would be blocked from travelling from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU. They will come into effect on Monday.\n\nAustralia announced on Saturday that flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi, and Mozambique would be suspended for 14 days. Non-Australians who have been in those countries in the past two weeks are now banned from entering Australia\n\nJapan has announced that from Saturday, travellers from much of southern Africa will need to quarantine for 10 days and take a total of four tests during that time\n\nIndia has ordered more rigorous screening and testing for travellers arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong\n\nCanada is barring all foreign nationals who have travelled through South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini or Mozambique in the last 14 days\n\nThe WHO said the number of cases of this variant, initially named B.1.1.529, appeared to be increasing in almost all of South Africa\u2019s provinces.\n\n\u201cThis variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,\u201d the UN public health body said in a statement on Friday.\n\nIt said \u201cthe first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November\u201d.\n\nThe WHO said it would take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as scientists worked to determine how transmissible it was.\n\nA top UK health official warned that vaccines would \u201calmost certainly\u201d be less effective against the new variant.\n\nBut Professor James Naismith, a structural biologist from the University of Oxford, added: \u201cIt is bad news but it\u2019s not doomsday.\u201d\n\nThe head of the South African Medical Association told the BBC that the cases found so far in South Africa \u2013 where only about 24% of the population is fully vaccinated \u2013 were not severe, but said investigations into the variant were still at a very early stage.\n\n\u201cThe patients are mostly complaining about a sore body and tiredness, extreme tiredness and we see it in the younger generation, it\u2019s not the older people\u2026 We\u2019re not talking about patients that might go straight to a hospital and be admitted,\u201d Dr Angelique Coetzee said.\n\nUS infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said that while the reports on the new variant threw up a \u201cred flag\u201d, it was possible that vaccines might still work to prevent serious illness.\n\nThe WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a \u201crisk-based and scientific approach\u201d.",
