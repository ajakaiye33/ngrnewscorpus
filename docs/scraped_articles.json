          "text": "One of the #EndSARS protesters lawyers, Adesina Ogunlana, says more than nine protesters were killed at the Lekki tollgate on October 20, 2020.\n\nHe explained that the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS-related Abuses and Other Matters named only nine deceased because of the evidence available before them.\n\nAccording to the report submitted by the panel, no fewer than nine #EndSARS protesters were killed at the Lekki tollgate on October 20, 2020, while four others were presumed dead.\n\nThe report listed 48 names as those who were casualties of the Lekki incident of October 20, 2020.\n\nAmong the 48 casualties listed, 24 sustained gunshot injuries, while 15 others were assaulted by soldiers and police.\n\nThe panel also noted that 96 other corpses were presented by a Forensic Pathologist of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Professor John Obafunwa, but were rejected over lack of concrete evidence linking the cause of their deaths to the Lekki tollgate.\n\nThe lawyer lamented that many families and witnesses were scared to testify publicly before the panel.\n\nWhile commending the efforts of the panel, he noted that the pieces of evidence supplied by the protesters and their legal teams overpowered those of the Army, police, and Lekki Concession Company.\n\nHe told The PUNCH in a telephone interview that some of the eyewitnesses thought they could be killed if they testified.\n\nOgunlana said, \u201cIt was a quality report not because it is favourable to us but the meticulous that went into it. A report of over 300 pages is not a joke. That report was unanimous. The police representative was there, government, respected lawyers and you have a sitting judge who did not sell her integrity.\n\n\u201cThe representation was rich and balanced. Our pieces of evidence overpowered them. They were more credible than those of LCC, police, army. The evidence brought by the petitioners was a quality one that sailed through despite cross-examination.\n\n\u201cI give kudos to the teams defending the protesters. We had galLant ladies that came up despite the intimidation. There was a fair hearing.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if only nine protesters were killed, he replied, \u201cThey are more than nine but the panel worked with those with concrete evidence.\n\n\u201cSome of the eyewitnesses and relatives were scared to speak. It was hectic to get people to testify. some thought they will be killed.\n\n\u201cAssuming that there was no fear, more people would have come out. Some people are regretting they didn\u2019t come out to. About five people withdrew when it was time to testify before the panel. They thought they will be hurt later.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Pauly Onyeka, stated this in Abuja while speaking with journalists on Soludo\u2019s developmental agenda for Anambra in the next years.\n\nHe said through the jobs from the above sectors as well as those from the industrial sector, Soludo hopes to also create about 520,000 jobs for young Anambrarians.\n\nAccording to him, Soludo\u2019s developmental agenda will seek the economic emancipation of the people through a policy on aggressive job creation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSoludo will revolutionise the industrial sector. In achieving the new needed horizon, he will not only open up the agrarian communities, but will massively launch world class agricultural policies and methodology that would computerize that sector and make it attractive to our youths with the attendant huge job creation, food sufficiency and also help as a feeder unit (raw material) to the industries.\n\n\u201cThrough the jobs from the above sectors as well as that from the ICT and modern skill acquisition programmes and the attached starter packs, Soludo hopes to create about 520,000 jobs and 4,000 youth millionaires in 4 years.\u201d\n\nThe APGA chieftain noted that though the Governor-elect would leverage his global network to attract foreign investors to Anambra, their relevance in the State will depend on whether such investors will create the value or solve an aspect of the problems difficult for the indigenous investors.\n\nHe added, \u201cThus, whether local or foreign investor, what Soludo needs is good results inherent in products that can compete locally and internationally.\n\n\u201cAnambra government under his watch shall patronize only made in Anambra products except where it is not readily available. This is why Soludo himself has reaffirmed that all the official vehicles for the office of the governor under him and other official vehicles of government must be Anambra brand.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of Soludo winning the Anambra governorship race through the help of a political godfather, the SMG queried: \u201cWho is that man in his right senses, that would pose himself before an international figure like the ex-CBN governor with the sole mission of being his political godfather? One of the numerous reasons our people voted for Soludo is that he is above being appropriated.\u201d\n\nThe group stated that no Anambra man can pressure the Governor-elect to toy with the mandate Ndi-Anambra freely gave to him in a tension soaked atmosphere.\n\nOnyeka, therefore, said Soludo\u2019s social agenda would be anchored on standard education, decent environment and the Rule Of Law",

          "title": "Lagos Endsars Panel releases list of casualties at Lekki Tollgate",
          "text": "By Nwafor Sunday\n\nThe Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters (Lagos EndSARS Panel), has released a list of forty-eight casualties from the Lekki Tollgate incident.\n\nAnyone with emotion will always have goose pimples whenever, he/she remembers the incident that happened on October, especially 20th, 2020, where a good number of Nigerian citizens were allegedly massacred, police stations burnt, as anarchy descended on us.\n\nBe that as it may, the Lagos EndSARS Panel , yesterday submitted its report, accusing the Nigerian Army and Police force of shooting at the innocent protesters at Lekki Tollgate, last year.\n\nIn its report, Members of the Panel chaired by HONOURABLE JUSTICE DORIS OKUWOBI (RTD) submitted that: \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a \u2018massacre\u2019 in context. \u201c\n\nThe Panel equally stated that \u201cApart from the military men in uniform, the Army left its base with vehicles, rifles and guns, which contained both live and blank bullets. General Taiwo admitted at page 22 that the Army went to the Lekki Toll Gate with live ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe Panel finds as credible, the case of the EndSARS protesters that soldiers shot directly at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020 as confirmed by Lagos State Ballistic Expert, Willie-Harry on page 244 that some video evidence indicate \u201c\u2026 instances where troops were seen to be re-arming their weapons before either discharging them to the air or purposely in the direction of the protesters \u2026\u201d\n\nWith the report of the Lagos state Panel, did Lai Mohammed lie?\n\nBased on the report presented by the Lagos state Judicial panel, which accused the Nigerian Army and Police of mishandling the incident at Lekki Tollgate through firing of live bullets which as reported killed a good number of Nigerian citizens, one would say that it contradicts the Press Conference of the minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, where he averred that: \u201cThe military did not shoot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, and there was no massacre at the toll gate. The only \u2018massacre\u2019 recorded was in the social media, hence there were neither bodies nor blood.\u201d\n\nBelow is his statement\n\n\u201cToday marks the first anniversary of the phantom massacre at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, which was the culmination of an otherwise peaceful protest that was later hijacked by hoodlums. At earlier press conferences, I had called the reported massacre at the toll gate the first massacre in the world without blood or bodies. One year later, and despite ample opportunities for the families of those allegedly killed and those alleging a massacre to present evidence, there has been none: No bodies, no families, no convincing evidence, nothing. Where are the families of those who were reportedly killed at the toll gate? Did they show up at the Judicial Panel of Inquiry? If not, why?\n\n\u201cSadly, the champions of a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate, including Amnesty International and CNN, have continued to shamelessly hold on to their unproven stand. Recall, gentlemen, that after bandying different figures, Amnesty International finally settled at about 12 people killed. On its part, CNN went from 38 people killed to two to just one, after a supposed global exclusive even when the network had no reporter on ground at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was set up by the Lagos State Government after the EndSARS protest wrapped up its sitting. During the sitting, CNN was summoned but it never showed up, thus missing a great opportunity to prove its allegation of massacre at the toll gate. Also, Amnesty International had a golden opportunity to convince the world, but it rather opted for issuing meaningless press releases.\n\n\u201cIn its latest attempt to grasp at straws and redeem whatever is left of its battered credibility on this issue, CNN has continued with its baseless report that soldiers shot at protesters. In a report currently running on the network, CNN brazenly and unashamedly held on to its flawed narrative, relying on an unidentified mother whose son was reportedly shot dead at Lekki, but without convincing evidence of who shot him dead. The same CNN that tweeted on Oct. 23rd 2020 that 38 people were shot dead at Lekki is now struggling to convince the world that one boy was killed at Lekki. What a shame!\n\n\u201cThe testimony of ballistic experts before the Judicial Panel of Inquiry in Lagos contradicts the tales by the moonlight by Amnesty International, CNN, a runaway DJ and their ilk. The experts, in their testimony, said inter alia:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the Victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters (emphasis mine) at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30-20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were examined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is however certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\n\u201cThe ballistic experts are not alone in reaching that conclusion. In its 2020 Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the U.S. State Department wrote:\n\n\u201cOn Oct. 20th (2020), members of the security forces enforced curfew by FIRING SHOTS INTO THE AIR (emphasis mine) to disperse protesters, who had gathered at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos to protest abusive practices by the Nigeria Police Force Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\n\u201cAccurate information on fatalities resulting from the shooting was not available at year\u2019s end. Amnesty International reported 10 persons died during the event, but the government disputed Amnesty\u2019s Report, and NO OTHER ORGANIZATION WAS ABLE TO VERIFY THE CLAIM (emphasis mine).\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the preponderance of evidence against any massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, we are once again reiterating what we said one year ago, that:\n\ni) The military did not shoot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Oct. 20th 2020, and there was no massacre at the toll gate. The only \u2018massacre\u2019 recorded was in the social media, hence there were neither bodies nor blood.\n\nii) Amnesty International, CNN, a runaway DJ and others like them should apologize for misleading the world that there was a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate and for portraying the Nigerian military, police and other security agencies in bad light.\n\niii) CNN acted unprofessionally by relying on unverified, and possibly-doctored social media videos, as well as other open-source information, to conclude that a massacre took place at the toll gate.\n\niv) The Federal Government remains proud of the security agencies for acting professionally and showing utmost restraint all through the EndSARS protest and the ensuing violence, an action that saved lives and properties.\n\nv) The six soldiers and 37 policemen who died during the EndSARS protests are human beings with families, even though the Human Rights Organizations and CNN simply ignored their deaths, choosing instead to trumpet a phantom massacre.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) has commenced training programmes to prepare Niger Delta youths, including ex-agitators, for loans offered by the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL).\n\nDAILY POST learnt that PAP is facilitating the process through capacity building to help entrepreneurs in the region get the qualifications required to apply for the loans.\n\nThe first phase of the training, which had 60 youths in attendance, kicked off in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, on Monday.\n\nThe Interim Administrator, PAP, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd), said 3000 entrepreneurs had opportunities to benefit from the loans to expand their businesses.\n\nHe explained that NIRSAL would select 30 youths for the pilot survey of the loan initiative after the training.\n\nDikio, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Project, Godwin Ekpo, emphasised that PAP was only acting as a guide to give qualified entrepreneurs from the region an opportunity to access the loans.\n\nDikio told the ex-agitators that the loans were not bazaars and should be paid back when obtained within the terminal period to enable NIRSAL extend the gesture to others.\n\nHe explained that the loans offered by NIRSAL were free of collateral with low interests but must be secured by guarantors to facilitate repayments.\n\nHe said PAP decided to facilitate because such opportunity was in line with his vision to turn the youths especially the ex-agitators to entrepreneurs.\n\nHe said the loans were for those who were already running their businesses to help them expand their ventures in order to generate more jobs for people.\n\nHe said: \u201cNIRSAL is supporting the SMEs with soft loans to enable them to expand their businesses. As PAP, our vision is to help our delegates become entrepreneurs and/or employable citizens contributing to the economy. So, we lookout for opportunities where they can access some level of funding to take their businesses to the next level.\n\n\u201cWe have other people that will be joining after this; this is just a pilot scheme. The partnership is one that will grow and we have a larger number. It must be stated again, that this is not a grant; these are low-interest loans, single-digit with no collateral that will be paid back after a while. The tenure of repayment and other conditions are stated in the papers they will sign.\n\n\u201cWe hope that these delegates will become more successful entrepreneurs in future as a result of this funding. Some of them are into agriculture, small scale businesses and we hope this fund will help them expand\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the lead consultant, Paul Tyokosu, said the essence of the training was to enable the entrepreneurs to have access to funding and skills to promote their businesses.\n\nHe asked the trainees to think of farming, agro-businesses and other agricultural value chains to expand their businesses and create more employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is designed to boost your capacity to grow your business. When you expand your business, you will help solve the problem of unemployment. Always ensure that your income is more than your liabilities\u201d, he said.\n\nOne of the trainees, Amatari Ogon, who runs a poultry farm, commended Dikio for introducing Niger Delta youths to opportunities that would empower them.\n\n\u201cThis training has shown that the amnesty boss has the passion for the empowerment and development of the Niger Delta region. It has exposed me to tips that will help me expand my poultry business,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Retro-Review of Grand Theft Auto V",
          "text": "Since its release in 2013, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) V, developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, has gone on to become one of the highest grossing video games ever and thought to be \u2018the most financially successful entertainment product of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue\u2019. Not only that, it has received awards such as VGX Award for Game of the Year, BAFTA Games Award for British Game, amongst other important awards in the video game industry. It is gamers\u2019 favourite that millions have played or enjoy re-playing again and again. One can even say it is an initiation rite \u2013 you don\u2019t have a bragging right as a gamer if you\u2019ve never played any of the Grand Theft Auto series.\n\nSo, what really endears GTA V to gamers? It is simple: the story. At the core of this action-adventure open world game is the simple story of three friends in the contemporary world of the fictionalised city of Los Santos. The city itself, modelled after Los Angeles, is a parody of contemporary American city with all its absurdities and vices. The popular axiom that it is people who make a city cannot be truer. The game\u2019s cityscape has different temperaments of many people that inhabit it.\n\nIn the three-lead protagonists plot and gaming experience, first, we are introduced to Franklin Clinton, a black male who works at a car dealership with his friend, Lamar. The game is very literalistic of the average black man living in an American city\u2019s downtown. Getting around the gameplay from the beginning, we see that Franklin is very ambitious and wants to escape the violence of his neighbourhood. He doesn\u2019t want a life of gangbangers like his friend, Lamar, but wants to \u2018chase papers\u2019 and sees his life not significantly going anywhere by merely running a series of errands for his dishonest and manipulative Armenian boss.\n\nJust as we are about investing time on him, we are introduced to another pivotal character, Michael De Santa, when Franklin went to repossess the car sold to Michael\u2019s son \u2013 which was more like steal \u2013 under the directive of his Armenian boss. On Franklin\u2019s drive back to his boss\u2019s office, Michael leaps up suddenly from the back seat with a gun to his head. The instruction is clear: he should ram the car into his boss\u2019 office or blow up his head and do it himself anyway. Franklin rams the vehicle into his boss\u2019s office and so begins his friendship with Michael.\n\nNow, Michael is a depressed or at best described as a restless or lacklustre husband and father. He is always seeking the attention and connection with his family, especially his kids, who are millennia and this difference in their cultural values frequently test their cohesion and commitment as a family.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn his return home after the episode with Franklin, Michael finds his wife cheating on him with her tennis coach. He enlists Franklin\u2019s hand in chasing after the guy and destroys what he thought to be his home, not knowing it actually belongs to a mafia boss. To pay back the mafia boss, he is forced back into a world he left a long time ago \u2013 the world of heists. He connects back with an old friend called Lester and carefully plans and pulls the score with Franklin. But the heist is riddled with too much of his signatures as a money mover. The heist violates the secret deal he made with an FIB agent (yeah, a parody of the FBI) to stay completely off the grid.\n\nThis also alerts Trevor Philips, his old buddy in the desert town of San Andreas on the outskirts of Los Santos, who has been searching for his whereabouts. The prologue that opens the game about a heist gone wrong is put into perspective now. Originally, there were three friends involved in a bank robbery all presumed dead: Michael Townley (now living under alias of Michael De Santa), Trevor Philips and Brad Snider.\n\nIn this cut scene introducing Trevor, he is doing a quickie on a girl, thrusting her from behind (yeah, the game is rated M17+), when the news on the t.v. catch his attention and stop mid stroke to pull on his pants. The cinematics of this scene appropriately deserves commendation from the producers. A movie can\u2019t do better. The room setting is a complete mess reflecting the personality of Trevor. The look on Trevor\u2019s face, too, is as if he had just seen a ghost. In fact, this is what he said when the boyfriend of the girl come charging that no matter what, whether under the influence of drug or no drug, he shouldn\u2019t be \u2018fucking\u2019 his girlfriend. Trevor is enraged.\n\nThe rap artiste, The Game sings on the lyrics of \u2018Let\u2019s Ride\u2019 contorting his face, clenching his teeth with vehemence, his signature look, leaving a threat hanging with the declaration:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m The Game, homie\n\nCall your girl, she ain\u2019t home\n\nShe with The Game, homie.\u2019\n\nWe don\u2019t get to see this violence act out in his music video in a scenario like this, but in this cut scene, Trevor acts out this violence as if bearing the lyrics of The Game in mind. He breaks a bottle on the boyfriend\u2019s face and repeatedly stamps on his head till his brain matter gets stuck under his boot. In fact, let\u2019s hear the dialogue here:\n\nJonny: Trevor, you been with my girl again! I\u2019m talking to you, asshole.\n\nRon: Don\u2019t do it, Jonny. I told him, Trevor, I told him.\n\n(Trevor walks past them holding a beer bottle)\n\nJonny: We all get high! We all get high! But that don\u2019t make it right! (He runs after him) Trevor! I\u2019m talking to you motherfucker.\n\nTrevor: (Turns back) Are you? What\u2019re you sayin?\n\nJonny: (Calms down) Fucking my girl, man, it\u2019s wrong.\n\nTrevor: Oh, I gotta fuck someone. You want me to fuck you instead? Is that the problem here? Take off your pants, cowboy, let\u2019s fuck.\n\nJonny: You think this is funny?\n\nTrevor: Get them off!\n\n(Ron, Wade and Jonny\u2019s girlfriend rushes towards them)\n\nRon: I told him to leave it, Trevor. I told him, \u2018Leave it; leave it.\u2019\n\nTrevor: Shut up! I\u2019m about to fuck me a meth head in a cowboy, get my boy sucked in from his toothless gum. Hmmm.\n\nJonny: Fuck you, Trevor. I still love her.\n\nTrevor grabs him by the neck and throws him on the ground. He bends over him and smashes his beer bottle on his face and stamps aggressively on his face. Well, this is Trevor for you.\n\nUnlike the other two characters, Trevor is a total psychopath, full of dirty language. But he is unpretentious like the other two. He is always in dirty clothing, wherever he is inhabiting is most likely in total disarray. The player will soon understand what accounts for this as little snippets from his childhood are talked about in conversations during the gameplay. Interestingly, Trevor is the character many gamers will identify with because he gives the pleasures of gunfight and interesting missions, unlike Michael who is always seeking his family\u2019s love and attention. Or not to talk of that daunting mission of attending flight school in order to learn how to fly aircraft.\n\nHe tracks down Michael and arrives at his doorstep, claiming to be his \u2018nemesis\u2019. He forces his way back into Michael\u2019s life and soon gets to know Franklin, too. Despite his flaws, his psychopathy and the fact that he can be a bully, like I said earlier, Trevor is that character that can easily warm his way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nThe arc of friendship is completed and they begin pulling scores, heists, first to help Michael out then to fulfil their greed. But along the line, they must also redeem their souls from the FIB agents who they must always do their bidding. It is this that will solidify the bond amongst the three friends and threaten to render asunder the bond. How to navigate the decision at the end of the game will become a burden or rather a precarious choice left to the gamer which makes the game even more interactive. The ending is not a neat and programmed one that a gamer must casually see through. It is a three-choice left to the gamer and by that you can play the game again and again with various endings in mind. But no matter the outcome you choose, a gamer most likely will experience a kind of lull that will spread this feeling of absurdism all over him. In this regard, the video game achieves its purpose about the meaninglessness of success.\n\nGTA V is an extremely entertaining video game with its life-like graphics and real world topics that are engaged and parodied in the game from climate change, legalisation of marijuana, and invasive social media. It is a visual satire of modern society and liberalism with immersive dialogue and action. Even the gamers who sit all day indoors behind their monitor instead of going out and meeting real people are not spared the satire. With more than 72 chapters, you\u2019re sure to enjoy the gameplay and different side-missions whether you are parachuting, scuba diving, helping some random strangers in distress on the street, practising yoga, cycling, boat racing, planning heists and fighting rival gangs, smuggling arms and drugs in airplanes, etc. With its whole cast of diverse characters: crackheads, racists, homophobes, drug lords, anti-immigrants, corrupt police agents, etc. it mirrors most of the complexities of the contemporary world. GTA V shows an immersive world is possible in a video game. The scriptwriters \u2013 Dan Houser, Rupert Humphries, Michael Unsworth \u2013 wrote incredible and memorable dialogues that will get under your skin. No matter who you are, if you love a good story, you will love Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nWith GTA VI rumoured to be in the making, it is important to point out things that the game developers must work on. Driving is still terrible in the game. It is absurd knocking off traffic lights, electric poles, post boxes, people on the street with no consequence of infraction or something all because stirring a vehicle is as slippery as oil. Even a first-shooter game, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, has a better driving simulation in that chapter of the game where there is a short driving stint, likewise a similar open world game, Watchdogs. The game critic Keza McDonald noted this, too, in her review, \u2018The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts.\u2019 Nevertheless, by comparison, the glitch-ridden CyberPunk2077 just released last year still can\u2019t beat GTA V. And the one cool thing about driving for this gamer is the varieties of radio channels available for selection, the different genres of music through these channels, the discussions of the city happenings and sometimes real world topics that are debated by radio DJs is stimulating.\n\nThe Grand Theft Auto series can only get better and better from here with improved graphics by the game developers at Rockstar North. When the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S was recently launched, a whole lot of gamers were looking forward to GTA VI but were disappointed when they learned it was still the same old GTA V that came with the consoles only with graphic improvement and some additional chapters. In addition to this, it was announced Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, a remastered version of the previous editions of the game, will be released on the new consoles later this November. Probably these are only paving the way for GTA VI.\n\nNow, perhaps, it is only right to sound this to African writers and creatives of the enormous opportunity in the video game industry. Last year, during the lockdown, the British Council in Lagos, too, hosted a webinar on the gaming industry and how Africans can participate. It is because the gaming industry is a vast enterprise that is worth billions of dollars. But it is acutely lacking in African imagination even though at the end of some video games you will see some Nigerian names on the credit roll. It would be interesting to have a first-shooter game like the Call of Duty franchise, for instance, adapt Chimananda Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun in their series. Because it is not enough that a whole chapter in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is set in a futuristic Lagos. Also, the overt fixation on Greek and other western mythologies in fantasy games is hegemonic in cultural space as can already be seen in the Marvel Studios outputs. It would be an interesting departure adapting African mythology, like the Ozidi saga for instance, in some games. But all these cannot be done without some interest from our cultural powerhouse. African script writers and creatives must make an effort to step in.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe death of \u00cct\u00f9n\u00fa Babalola, Nigerian sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in C\u00f4te Divoire for alleged human trafficking has sparked outrage and wild condemnation just as the Federal Government has demanded for full autopsy report.\n\nA statement by the Chairman Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa stated that Itunnu\u2019s case was drawn to the attention of NIDCOM about five months ago. She described the death as a tragic blow, at a time the Nigerian mission in C\u00f4te Divoire had paid and engaged the services of a lawyer to handle Itunnu\u2019s appeal case, \u201cunfortunately, Itunnu died abruptly while all hands were on deck to seek both legal and diplomatic intervention for her by Nigeria. Itunnu was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for an offence she did not apparently commit. Itunnu had accused an Ivorian of robbery at her residence and insisted on filing a case against him.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nItunnu filed charges against him and allegedly used a different name (not her real name) to file the case and somehow a case of robbery which she filed mysteriously turned to a case of human trafficking against her.\n\nShe was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment while the Nigerian mission in Cote Divoire supported by the Nigerian community, got her a lawyer, paid part payment of legal fees for the lawyer, to appeal the judgment, while at the same time seeking diplomatic intervention from the Nigeria Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cHer death, will however, not stop the appeal in court in order to vindicate her of the charges against her,\u201d she assured.\n\nRegardless, Nigerians on social media have continued to react to the death of Itunu Babalola. Dr. Funmilayo, who is based in the UK said: \u201cThey abandoned and neglected Itunu and now she is dead. This lady was wrongly jailed for a crime she never committed. She reported a theft against her and she got locked up for the same theft she went to report\u2026.She was neglected, abandoned and left to languish.\u201d\n\nA lawyer, Dr. Ayo Sogunro, wrote: \u201cWhat is the value of a Nigerian life anywhere?\u201d while Mr. Demola Olarenwaju said: \u201cUnderstand that every failure of government kills the fire of patriotism in citizens, one candle at a time. Itunu Babalola didn\u2019t just die alone \u2013 her death has snuffed out the light of hope in those who dared to believe that just maybe this time, Nigeria would turn up differently.\u201d\n\nAnother Nigerian, Dr. Aloy Chife said: \u201cThe death of Itunu is a most horrific but avoidable tragedy. I live abroad and understand very well the general lack of care often shown Nigerians abroad by their government, so one always tries to do one\u2019s best regarding matters like this.\u201d\n\nA pilot, Mr. Arinze Odira said: \u201cIf Itunu was an American, she wouldn\u2019t had died in prison in a foreign land. Nigerians are seeking PR in other countries because it seems we place no value on human life down here. Besides awarding contracts and moving around with SUVs and DSS officials, what else do our leaders do?\u201d while Chukwudebelu said: \u201cReligion has a bright future in an Africa full of failing states, because that is one of the few places one sees the semblance of a social contract. Churches will not abandon their members the same way the Nigerian government abandoned Itunu.\u201d\n\nDr. Chinonso Egbema said: \u201cWhat is painful about Itunu\u2019s death is that the people who did nothing to secure her release will wake up iron their suits and go to work like nothing happened. No regard for life.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Abdul Mahmud tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s only an irresponsible government that cares little for the citizens abroad. Worse still, it is only an irresponsible government that doesn\u2019t provide consular assistance for its citizens abroad. Nigeria fails its citizens. Itunu is the latest example of that failure. Remember May 1981? Here, five soldiers were murdered inside Nigeria by Camerounian gendarmes. Shehu Shagari expressed shock without taking action. It took the actions of UNILAG and Yabatech students who stormed Cameroun embassy in Lagos and destroyed it for Shagari to act\u2026 Nigeria abandoning Nigerians is as old as our memories of Zebrudaya\u2019s Imo River. When Nigeria kills its citizens at home, foreigners feel the compulsion to kill Nigerians abroad.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe World Bank has stated that the destruction caused by the Boko Haram sect caused economic activities in the north-eastern part of the country to decline by 50 per cent.\n\nThe multilateral institution noted that Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states which are in the Lake Chad region saw economic activities decline from 10 to 14 per cent between 2009 and 2013, adding that the region has recorded 50 per cent decline in activities from 2018.\n\nSpeaking at the Launch of the Lake Chad regional economic memorandum, Lead Economist, World Bank and Co-author of the report, Mr. Marco Hernandez said: \u201cIn northern Nigeria, we see that 50 per cent or more of crop yields have been affected as a result of conflict, there is a huge cost that could very well turns into a benefit because that takes into account other factors that have been going on at the time, including, for instance, issues related to climate.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the effects of Boko Haram alone, once again, you now isolate it from all the different things that are going on in the region, what we have seen is that there are two messages to highlight on the one hand, that economic activity has fallen and the large reduction in economic activity has become even more apparent with time.\n\n\u201cIt used to be 10 to 14 per cent of reduced economic activity when Boko Haram was just starting, but now closer to 2018 and so it has been closer to 50 per cent of economic activity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBoko Haram is not just on those places where insurgency happens, it also affects neighbouring parts for where the actual attack happens as well.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, for the region to grow, the bank called for enhanced trade, improved infrastructure to move people good and services, improved governance and management of natural resources.\n\nHe added: \u201cNow, when we take into account that security as an underlying precondition for developing the Lake Chad region, we focus on four key areas that we believe are essential to help break that cycle.\n\n\u201cThe first one is trade facilitation; the ability to move goods and services from one place to another; connected infrastructure specially to make it easier for those goods and services to move in and including labour as well.\n\n\u201cThe third area is governance and the importance that it has across all the different development challenges that Lake Chad region faces. And the fourth one is about natural resource management.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Country Director for Nigeria, World Bank, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri advised Nigeria to urgently tackle insecurity to enhance growth especially in the north-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think especially for an institution like the World Bank, you know we are for development and for that, we need peace and security to proceed with development.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "In Damning Report, Lagos #EndSARS Panel Says 11 Killed at Lekki Tollgate",
          "text": "\u2022Reveals 24 injured, 15 assaulted, 96 corpses found across states\n\n\u2022Says Army refused to allow medical help for the wounded\n\n\u2022Recommends various sanctions for accused officers\n\n\u2022Indicts LCC for manipulation of videos\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu sets up implementation c\u2019ttee, submits report to NEC\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn a damning report released yesterday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) set up by the Lagos state government to probe the October 20, 2020 #EndSARs protest has revealed that at least 11 persons were killed during the peaceful demonstration at the Lekki Tollgate and another four missing but presumed dead making a total of 15.\n\nThe report, which also called the Lekki Tollgate shootings of October 20, 2020, \u201ca massacre,\u201d was an incriminating indictment of heightening extrajudicial killings and unprofessionalism by Nigerian law enforcement agents\n\nThe report described as \u201catrocious\u201d, the maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor, waving their Nigerian flags and singing the National Anthem, stressing that the act could be equated to a \u201cmassacre in context.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, aside the 11 confirmed dead, four others were presumed dead, while in all 48 were casualties of the Lekki incident which shook the entire country last year.\n\nOf the 48 casualties listed, the panel stated that 24 sustained gunshot injuries, while 15 others were assaulted by soldiers and police, revealing that 96 other corpses were presented by a Forensic Pathologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Prof. John Obafunwa.\n\nIn the 309-page report, which specifically indicted the soldiers and the police, the panel stated that it unravelled the fact that after the Nigerian Army exited the scene, the Nigeria Police Force, followed up with the killing of the protesters, shooting directly at fleeing protesters who had run into the shanties and the Lagoon.\n\nStating that a number of unidentified bodies were removed by security agencies and the Lagos State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (LASEHMU) and deposited at various hospital mortuaries in Lagos State, the panel stressed that trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Tollgate in the morning of October 21, to clean up the scene and conceal evidence.\n\nThe panel comprised a retired Judge of the Lagos State High Court, Justice Doris Okuwobi as Chairperson, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Taiwo Lakanu, Patience Patrick-Udoh (Representative Civil Society), \u2018Segun Awosanya and Oluwatoyin Odusanya.\n\nOthers were Lucas Koyejo, Majekodunmi Oluwaseun and Mr. Babajide Boye, who acted as secretary .\n\nThe two-volume document which were presented to the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Ikeja, a copy of which was obtained by THISDAY, called for the establishment of a body to look at human rights abuses in Lagos because it could not hear all the petitions submitted to it.\n\nAccording to the panel, there were evidences of cover-up by the Army when they removed the corpses of the fallen protesters with their vans.\n\nThe Panel stated that Army should never have been deployed in the first place since the protest was largely peaceful. \u201cin the light of all the above that issue of whether or not the Army kept to any particular rules of engagement is immaterial since the invitation of the Army to Lagos state and the deployment of the Army to Lekki Toll Gate in the first place was totally unwarranted. The Army should on no account be deployed against unarmed.\u201d\n\nThe panel also found out that most of the 96 corpses for which autopsies were conducted by the state\u2019s chief pathologist, Obafunwa, remained unidentified but were labelled #Endsars, lending credence to the belief that the shooting by security agencies resulted in mass deaths.\n\nSpecifically, it recommended disciplinary actions against one Lt. Col S.O. Bello and Major General Godwin Umelo, who refused to honour the summons of the panel in order to frustrate the investigation.\n\nIt declared that all officers (excluding Maj. Gen. Omata) and men of the Nigerian Army that were deployed to the Lekki tollgate on the date should be made to face appropriate disciplinary action, stripped of their status, and dismissed as they are not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\n\nThe panel stated that all those arrested in the course of the protest should be granted bail, prosecuted for any offence that may be alleged against them or where no prima facie evidence of culpability is disclosed upon due investigation, should be released forthwith.\n\nIt also recommended that the Nigeria Army should be discouraged from intervening in internal security of the country forthwith.\n\nPanel\u2019s terms of reference\n\nAmong others, the body was set up to identify victims of abuse, brutality and extra judicial killings in the hands of officers of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and officers of the Nigeria Police and to carry out investigative duties in respect of petitions received on police brutality and extra-judicial killings in Lagos State\n\nIn addition, it was to evaluate evidence and draw conclusions on the validity of such petitions received; to determine and recommend compensation for verifiable/deserving victims and their dependents; and to interrogate serving or dismissed officers of the disbanded SARS and the police responsible for the abuse of victims and recommend their prosecution\n\nIn summary, the panel\u2019s duty also involved unravelling whether the Nigerian Army used live bullets on unarmed and defenceless protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on 20th October 2020 and whether the live bullets resulted in injuries or casualties on the part of the protesters.\n\nFurthermore, it was to find out whether the police was at the tollgate on the night of the 20th of October 2020 and the morning of the 21st of October 2020 and whether they shot at unarmed and defenceless protesters.\n\nAs part of its terms of reference, the panel also probed whether the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) played any role in the events of the night of the 20th of October 2020 and generally whether the Lagos State played any role in the Lekki Tollgate incident.\n\nKey findings\n\nThe Okuwobi-led panel noted that it found out indeed the Nigerian Army was indeed invited for intervention in the state and was deployed to the Lekki Tollgate on the said date, saying the invitation of the armed was unwarranted.\n\nAt the Lekki tollgate, it noted that during the probe, it discovered that \u201cofficers of the Nigerian Army shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out all these happened while the peaceful demonstrators, \u201cwere waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the National Anthem,\u201d adding that \u201cthe manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre.\u201d\n\nThe panel also found that the conduct of the Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance and did not adhere to its own rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that the Nigerian Police Force deployed its officers to the Lekki tollgate on the night of the 20th October, 2020 and between that night and the morning of the 21st of October, 2020, its officers shot at, assaulted and battered unarmed protesters, which led to injuries and deaths. The police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets.\n\n\u201cThe panel found that the LCC hampered the panel\u2019s investigation by refusing to turn over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the panel and the forensic expert engaged by the panel, even where such information and evidence was by the company\u2019s admission, available. It manipulated the incomplete CCTV video footage of the Lekki Tollgate on the night of the 20th of October 2020, which it tendered before the panel,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt stated that there was indeed an invitation of the Nigerian Army to Lagos State by the state government through the governor before the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army deployed its soldiers to the scene on the said night.\n\nIt added that there was an attempt to cover up the incident by the cleaning of the Lekki scene and the failure to preserve the scene ahead of potential investigations.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn all, the panel made a total of 32 recommendations, which included sanctioning of the officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police Force respectively who participated in shooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protestors at the Lekki tollgate on the 20 and 21st of October 2020;\n\nIt also called for the development of more robust engagement between the youth and the government and the setting up of a standing committee/tribunal to deal with cases of violation of human rights by security agencies and a trust fund to settle compensation awarded by such tribunal.\n\nIt added: \u201cThere should be a public apology to #ENDSARS protesters who were killed, injured and traumatised by the incident of the 20th of October 2020 and the memorialisation of the Lekki Tollgate and the 20th of October going forward.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of hospitals and medical doctors who played heroic roles following the Incident of the Lekki tollgate on the 20th of October 2020 thereby saving lives and minimising the impact of the injuries suffered by the victims, most of which were on a pro-bono basis.\u201d\n\nThe panel further recommended various sums of compensation to victims of the Lekki incident, which must be expeditious in order to accelerate the healing process, insisting that any data that may have been generated over the years on the impunity of the police across Nigeria be studied and deployed as early warning signs (EWS) mechanism.\n\nThe panel stated that it had the cooperation of most stakeholders save for the Nigerian Army and some others who ignored summons issued by the panel and lauded those represented by their counsel , including, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) , counsel to the various groups of ENDSARS protesters, counsel to Lagos State Government, and counsel to the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt listed its greatest limitation as time, as it had to undertake its investigation into the Lekki tollgate incident alongside other petitions in respect of police brutality related matters.\n\nThe panel also recommended that the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the Maroko police station along with policemen deployed from Maroko should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of protesters.\n\nSanwo-Olu Sets up implementation committee, submits report to NEC,\n\nFollowing the report, the governor has vowed that his government would implement the recommendations of the panel.\n\nSpeaking when he received the report of the panel, Sanwo-Olu immediately constituted a four-member committee led by Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo to raise a white paper on the report within two weeks.\n\nAccording to him, the committee was expected to produce the document to be considered by the Lagos State executive council, pledging that the reports and recommendations would be made public and submitted to the National Economic Council (NEC) for discussion.\n\nThe committee has the Commissioner for Youths and Social Development, Mr. Segun Dawodu; Special Adviser, Works and Infrastructure, Mrs. Aramide Adeyoye and Permanent Secretary, Cabinet Office, Mrs. Tolani Oshodi as members.\n\n\u201cThe four of them will very quickly, look through and bring forward a white paper within the next two weeks that will be considered at the Lagos State Executive Council and would be gazetted as a white paper coming from the panel of enquiry,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governor assured that all the recommendations in the submitted reports would be treated, even as he expressed optimism that the government\u2019s decision on the reports would bring healing, reconciliation and restitution.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that the recommendations that are coming out that will be turned into a white paper will be made available to the public. We will do it appropriately, so that history will judge us well.\n\n\u201cWe will have a document that will stand the test of time, that\u2019s what the tribunal law says, so that it will be properly documented and gazetted in government\u2019s records\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Panel, Okuwobi ,expressed appreciation to the state government and all the stakeholders who appeared before the panel and the team for uncommon resolve and good team work.\n\nOkuwobi, who disclosed that the panel awarded a total of N410 million to 70 victims of police brutality, said 235 petitions were received with only 14 being on the alleged Lekki shooting incident.\n\n\u201cAs much as the panel desired to have taken all petitions, the ones that were not taken by the panel were those that did not comply with our rules. So, in this report, we made recommendations for a body to take over human rights abuse cases in Lagos State\u201d she said.\n\nMonetary Cost of the Year Long Investigation, N800 million\n\nSources within Alausa yesterday hinted to THISDAY the cost implication of the year\u2019s long investigation. It cost the state government a whopping N800 million to ensure the panel did not experience any funding issues that might have hindered the conclusion of its enquiry.\n\nA competent source within Alausa told THISDAY last night that, Sanwo-Olu had immediately matched his promise with action by flying to Abuja after receiving the report to submit it to the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\n\u201cSo two things the governor promised, he is already doing; one to set up a panel to review the report and come up with a white paper that will give teeth to government action and two, he promised to submit the report to NEC, which he did yesterday, after receiving the panel\u2019s report. He flew to Abuja to submit it to NEC. So, action is already being taken. As you can see there was complete independence of the panel,\u201d the source added.\n\nSanwo-Olu had on October 19, 2020, inaugurated the panel to investigate alleged cases of brutality and human rights violations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But all challenges are surmountable if both the public and private sectors collaborate,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cAs we implement, we must ensure that we create jobs and enhance revenues for all parties. We must leverage on one another\u2019s strengths to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe President also said business people must key into existing regional value chains or build new ones, either to extend operations into the higher value segments of their industries or to satisfy the area\u2019s rules of origin requirements.\n\nNoting that Free Trade must also be fair, Buhari said fairness can only be achieved when there is full compliance with regulations especially those relating to rules of origin.\n\n\u201cThe Intra-Africa Trade Fair is uniquely positioned to help in these areas,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on the benefits of the Trade Fair, Buhari said, \u201cThrough these gatherings, we will be laying a solid foundation for future business-to-business, business and government, and government to government co-operation.\u201d\n\nAssuring participants that Nigeria came to Durban in full force to actively participate in the trade fair and take full advantage of all the opportunities it provides.\n\nThe President, while assuring participants that Nigeria is open for business, said: \u201cWe have streamlined the country\u2019s participation under one-roof to enable you access all the information you need.\n\n\u201cAs many of you are aware, in the past five years, Nigeria has made significant strides towards the diversification of her economy from an oil revenue dependent country to a nation with diverse revenue sources.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve this by putting in place fiscal, monetary and trade policies that support investments and investors in key sectors such as Agriculture, Mining, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, Banking and Financial services, tourism, and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe also introduced reforms in key institutions as well as policies to fight corruption and ease the way of doing business in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the African Union Commission, the AFCFTA Secretariat and the Africa Export Import Bank for their dedication and relentless effort in seeing this very worthy initiative become a reality.\n\nHe also commended the people of Durban for hosting this year\u2019s intra-African trade fair and expressed hope that it will witness milestone agreements among African businesses at this gathering.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Muhammadu Buhari\n\nYour Excellency, Mr. President, I wish to specifically thank you for inviting me to attend this programme. Let me at the outset, convey on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria and myself, our deepest condolences on the passing of the former president of South Africa, Mr. Frederik Willem de Klerk.\n\n2. Together with former President Mandela, they gave birth to a new South Africa. I send my condolences to his family and friends.\n\n3. \u200bToday is a great day for Africa as we start our collaborative journey towards collective economic prosperity through the African Continental Free Trade Area. I very much look forward to seeing more African products manufactured in Africa using African resources.\n\n4. Let me start by congratulating the African Union Commission, the AFCFTA Secretariat and the Africa Export Import Bank for their dedication and relentless effort in seeing this very worthy initiative become a reality.\n\n5. I, also commend the people of Durban for hosting this year\u2019s intra-African trade fair. I sincerely hope that we will witness milestone agreements among African businesses at this gathering.\n\n6. Through these gatherings, we will be laying a solid foundation for future business-to-business, business and government, and government to government co-operation.\n\n7. Most of Africa\u2019s existing challenges, whether security, economy or corruption, can be traced to our inability over the years to domesticate the production of our most basic requirements and provide jobs to our teeming and dynamic youth population.\n\n8. Under the African Continental Free Trade Area, we can double our intra-Africa trade by 2030, reduce our reliance on imports and therefore create more jobs within the continent.\n\n9. We cannot achieve this goal by talking alone. The implementation will be a difficult journey. But all challenges are surmountable if both the public and private sectors collaborate.\n\n10. On the public sector side, Governments must support local entrepreneurs to build scale and therefore improve productivity.\n\n11. This means providing incentives to encourage our businesses to formalise and comply with laid down regulations.\n\n12. Free Trade must also be Fair. And fairness can only be achieved when there is full compliance with regulations especially those relating to rules of origin.\n\n13. The AFCFTA is for \u201cmade-in-Africa\u201d products and services.\n\n15. Let me assure you that Nigeria has come to Durban in full force to actively participate in this very important trade fair and take full advantage of all the opportunities it provides.\n\n16. We have streamlined the country\u2019s participation under one-roof to enable you access all the information you need.\n\n17. As many of you are aware, in the past five years, Nigeria has made significant strides towards the diversification of her economy from an oil revenue dependent country to a nation with diverse revenue sources.\n\n18. We were able to achieve this by putting in place fiscal, monetary and trade policies that support investments and investors in key sectors such as Agriculture, Mining, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, Banking and Financial services, tourism, and manufacturing.\n\n19. \u200bWe also introduced reforms in key institutions as well as policies to fight corruption and ease the way of doing business in Nigeria.\n\n20. Ladies and Gentlemen, Nigeria is open for business.\n\n21. I wish you all a very successful trade fair.\n\nThank you all and God Bless Africa and its people.\n\n*Full text of the address by President Muhammadu Buhari at the opening ceremony of the Intra-African Trade Fair 2021 at Durban, South Africa on Monday, Novermber 15, 2021\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "With 559 Days to Go, Buhari on Aggressive Int\u2019l Investment Drive",
          "text": "*From Saudi Arabia, France, now South Africa, president wooing investors\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWith 559 days to the end of his tenure, a normally reticent President Muhammadu Buhari has come out of his shell, flying from one investment summit to another in aggressive pursuit of foreign investors.\n\nNigerians are currently seeing a different Buhari who is eager to document his achievements at every stop on his international investment drive.\n\nIn France last week, when he hosted Managing Director of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser, and Chief Executive Officer of Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, among other global CEOs, Buhari had said, \u201cWe need roads, rail, power, airports, housing, and that is what we have engaged ourselves with in the past six years.\n\n\u201cAnd our people are seeing the new developments. Relative to the resources available to us, we have not done badly.\n\n\u201cWhat we are so dependent on (crude oil) has lost a lot of energy. It is coming back gradually, and we are breathing a bit more with some confidence. But we expect greater cooperation from you.\u201d\n\nThe president has been on an unusually aggressive investment promotion push in the past three weeks, moving from Saudi Arabia, to France and, presently, South Africa, as he markets the country\u2019s business opportunities to global investors in the quest to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs).\n\nBuhari departed Paris, the French capital, at the weekend to join other African leaders in South Africa for the opening ceremony of the second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) 2021. The trade expo is expected to attract $40 billion investments to the continent. The president is attending the event on the special invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nThe event, holding from today to November 21, is convened by the African Export-Import Bank (AFREXIM), in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC) and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat.\n\nThe fair, with the theme, \u201cBuilding Bridges for a Successful AfCFTA,\u201d is aimed at boosting trade and investment across the African continent.\n\nIt also promises to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive across the African continent; bring to fruition the lofty ideas behind the creation of AfCFTA by providing the platform to further identify and proffer solutions to challenges militating against intra-African trade; and generate market information needed to connect buyers and sellers throughout the continent.\n\nWhile in Paris, the president took part in a one-day Nigeria International Partnership Forum, with focus on, \u201cBeyond the Pandemic,\u201d as well as the Peace Forum, both of which afforded him the opportunity to market Nigeria to the world. These investment meetings came few days after the president returned from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he also participated in a three-day investment conference organised by the Future Investment Initiative Institute.\n\nIn France, top government officials as well as captains of industry in the country discussed business opportunities in Nigeria, with participants agreeing that the country needs massive infrastructure growth to have a seat among the world\u2019s industrialised nations.\n\nSome senior government functionaries and businessmen who took part in one of the panel discussions broadcast on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, included Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Power, Aliyu Abubakar; Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Ali Pantami; and Minister of State, Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki.\n\nOthers were Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari; Chairman, BUA Group and President of the France-Nigeria Business Council, Abdul Samad Rabiu; Founder, Zenith Bank Plc, Jim Ovia; Chief Executive, Oando, Wale Tinubu; and President, African Export-Import Bank, Dr Benedict Oramah.\n\nSamad, speaking at the Nigeria International Partnership Forum, tagged \u201cBeyond the Pandemic\u201d, explained that Nigeria sat atop billions of tonnes of mineral resources. For instance, he said, the country only produced 30 million tonnes of its five billion tonnes reserves.\n\nHe stated that although opportunities abounded in the country, the dearth of infrastructure remained a big problem, explaining, for instance, that transporting a container load of products from China to Lagos is cheaper than shipping the same items from Lagos to Kano.\n\nThe BUA chief executive argued that he shut down some of the company\u2019s production plants in the country because of the lack of power supply, noting that a lot of foreign investments would be required in the sector.\n\nSamad stated, \u201cWe are sitting on billions of tonnes of different mineral resources. If you look at limestone, the area that I represent, because I have plants in Nigeria, Nigeria is sitting on over 4-5 billion tonnes of limestone. Today, we are producing about 30 million tonnes of cement, that is a combination of all the companies that are in Nigeria and scattered all over the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigeria was one of about 12 countries sitting on iron ore, gas, and coal, yet it remained the only country not producing steel and spent $2.5 billion annually importing the commodity.\n\nSamad said, \u201cYet, with $2.5 billion, you wi,ll be able to set up a plant of 1.5 to 2 million tonnes per annum, which means that with that amount of money that you spend annually importing steel, you will be able to set up a plant that will be processing steel forever and, therefore, won\u2019t need to spend that money every year.\n\n\u201cYou know, because without infrastructure, there is nothing you can do. Today, believe it or not, it is cheaper to transport a container from China to Lagos than to transport the container from Lagos to Kano. And that is the truth. Even though you know freight rates have gone up and that is because we do not have proper infrastructure at the ports.\n\n\u201cWe have only about three ports, so we need to improve on these areas. But all these things need finance. And unless, of course, we are able to get finance and be able to do these things, it will be very difficult.\u201d\n\nKyari stated that the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) presented another opportunity for Nigeria, stressing that the current high oil and gas prices are only a reflection of the imbalance between demand and supply.\n\nHe said, \u201cSupply is not meeting demand today. As we all may be aware, today, global demand is at levels above pre-COVID levels. It is about 100 million bpd.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Pantami stressed that Nigeria remained the economic gateway to West Africa, with over 200 million people. He said the rest of West Africa was just about the same population with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the entire continent of Africa has a population of approximately 1.3 billion people,\u201d Pantami stated. He added, \u201cBeing in Nigeria, you are relatively at the centre. And you will have proximity to other parts of Africa, particularly when it comes to investing in Information and Communications Technology (ICT).\n\n\u201cAs we all know that the youth are the digital natives. They understand ICT better than any other category. In Nigeria, you will discover that the average age in our country is 18.1 years old. By implication, our population has been dominated by the youth and they are digital natives.\n\n\u201cIn addition, this makes Nigeria to be the 14th youngest country in the world, as it is today. So, these are some of the benefits we have in Nigeria, in addition to cheap labour, and many more and the cosmopolitan nature of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile underscoring the need for foreign investment, Ovia recalled that when the telecommunications industry began to grow in Nigeria, the then Econet brought its technology from Zimbabwe, a much smaller country, while MTN brought its own from South Africa. He lamented that today, while tele-density was 100 per cent, broadband technology deployments remained at 40 per cent, stressing that there\u2019s still tremendous opportunity in technology.\n\nOando boss, Tinubu stated that Nigeria had shown that it could be transparent in business, pointing that the open nature of the GSM bidding process in the early 2000s confirmed that Nigeria was capable of doing the right thing.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe had a very simple, transparent advertisement for GSM licences, in the newspapers and on the radio. You paid a $20 million deposit to bid for licence. Now, this is an environment, which always was chastised that it\u2019s a corrupt country, which nothing ever happens.\n\n\u201cWe had a licence, bid for it, we won, $285 million and a group of young people started a GSM company, which rolled out. Today, it is a 30 million, 40 million line company. We have 120 million active GSM lines in Nigeria and one of the highest tele-densities in the world. There is skill in Nigeria and there is a market.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, President of Africaxim Bank, Oramah, argued that as long as Nigeria remained in the lower rungs of the value chain, it will never experience high economic growth.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, what is the way out you may ask? I have no fresh insights to bring because we have discussed these same problems over and over again. But what we must do is begin to do what we always understand are the solutions.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the one clear way out is that we must begin to trade more with ourselves. In fact, I don\u2019t think we need a rocket scientist to give us a solution. The solution is that we must all start doing, instead of just talking about problems and solutions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Nigerians are currently seeing a different Buhari who is eager to document his achievements at every stop on his international investment drive.\nThe president is attending the event on the special invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nThese investment meetings came few days after the president returned from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he also participated in a three-day investment conference organised by the Future Investment Initiative Institute.\nFor instance, he said, the country only produced 30 million tonnes of its five billion tonnes reserves.\nIf you look at limestone, the area that I represent, because I have plants in Nigeria, Nigeria is sitting on over 4-5 billion tonnes of limestone.",

          "title": "Nigeria's technology ecosystem and its lower-class population",
          "text": "This article was submitted to TechCabal by Dare Tunmise. Dare Tunmise is a writer interested in both poetry and technology.\n\nIt had been three days since the lights went out on the off campus streets of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). Exams were approaching, and students trooped out of their lodgings to find public places\u2014barbing salons, electronics and grocery stores, eateries\u2014to charge their phones and laptops. In a corner, at one such place, John*, a 100 level student of computer engineering, sat by a plugged Android phone, shuffling between two apps, a code editor and a browser; and in his lap sat a book titled, Introduction to Algorithms.\n\nJohn had recently met a group of tech enthusiasts like himself on Nairaland where they had been lucky to be mentored by an experienced developer who kept them updated with assignments attached to strict deadlines. This explains why, after a three-day power cut on campus, with a dead phone and an important task that would judge his progress, John left the comfort of his hostel to sit in a noisy shop filled with noise and mosquitoes to complete his coding tasks. But John\u2019s story is just one of many accounts of the grit and passion of Nigerian youths from the lower class, who are determined to break into tech.\n\nThe rise in technology advocacy and youth unemployment\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the number of young people beating a path to the doors of Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. Many factors are responsible for this. With social media bringing diverse people together and creating a sort of boundary collapse, there has been a rapid rise in tech advocacy among young people including those with no technological background. Another factor to consider is the high unemployment rate in the country. In a report on its website, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics recorded the youth unemployment rate at 42.5% in the last quarter of 2020. These, in addition to individual interest, are two of many factors driving a lot of people into learning digital skills\u2014programming especially\u2014in order to explore its many possibilities.\n\nBut learning computer programming\u2014even with the availability of free online resources, YouTube tutorials and mentorship from developer communities online\u2014does not make coding an easy subject for most beginners whose computer knowledge is limited to MS Word and Mavis Beacon; many quit the course after only a few weeks of learning.\n\nFor Nigerian tech newbies, the reasons for quitting are not far-fetched. With no bootcamps, healthy tools, power outage which is sure to last for days, enabling environments and with little resources for internet connections, constraints soon become glaring to our aspiring developer. This is the situation with Bolaji, an economics undergraduate at the University of ibadan, who after every school day tiredly sit in the dorm room he shares with six others, waiting for power supply, a cheap internet connection that is active only on a midnight plan, of which as he opens the tutorial on the youtube channel, even with his heavy use of coffee or redbull, he soon doze off, dreaming of assignments and school works, a pattern that soon becomes repetitive, engulfing him to finally postpone his 100 days of code.\n\nInstances are not scarce since the struggle is common and understandable, and the harsh pattern of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps has been found peculiar to many of such people who went from zero tech knowledge to gaining a skill set that allowed them to build amazing products or work for corporate bodies. Speaking about his experience, Kay*, who works as an engineer for a tech startup in Nigeria, recalled how, six years ago, he had struggled with the lack of personal tools, internet connection, and epilectic power supply, and how these factors had stalled his learning, and almost sent him into depression. He recalled too how he\u2019d secretly downloaded a code editor on his mother\u2019s laptop to learn coding while she was in bed.\n\nBut it is not a triumph everywhere, at least not for the many indigent tech enthusiasts who await the miracle of laptops acquired from giveaways, or others who started out learning coding on their mobile smartphones, but quit due to the technical limitations of phones.\n\nIn a now pinned tweet he made on July 7, Thomas Burkhart, founder of DevsHelsDevs, a charity organisation founded out of the need to help indigent Africans interested in coding with laptops and other requirements, wrote about how handling the streams of requests he receives through his direct messages have been heavy on his mental health and how he needs to pause a bit on the donations. Looking through the organisation\u2019s website where donations and requests are tracked, with a budget deficit and an endless number of requests, one is left to wonder about the number of developers whose learning would be stalled and who would have no choice but to look into something else outside of coding.\n\nThe absence of infrastructure and resources in Nigeria\u2019s technology ecosystem\n\nProgramming is highly demanding work. It requires finance, time, passion and dedication. For Nigerian tech enthusiasts, however, the problem is not passion; it is not the absence of grit or hunger. The problem is the absence of the materials\u2014in communities where power supply is a rare gift; where internet connection is a luxury; where these dreamers are not afforded the opportunity to sit all day with laptops because, who would provide your daily bread? These dreamers live in a less industrialised state where government apathy towards youth empowerment is glaring; where policies are designed to stifle dreams; where, for many, the goal of being a software engineer will eventually become a dream too far to reach.\n\nEveryday, there is a spread of technological awareness among young people, with many considering a career in tech, and while the journey might be an easy ride for those that are privileged and have all the resources needed at their reach, especially in industrialised nations where existing structures make the industry accessible for all sorts of people, for the Nigerian lower class, breaking into tech is an experience fraught with travail and all sort of bootstrapping\u2014an exodus that has witnessed many potential techstars quit out of frustration and the psychological discouragement of not meeting a world class status, while a few earned their stripes by walking like a camel through the eye of a needle.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current surge in the price of cryptocurrencies (bull run) is perhaps one of the most exciting in the crypto market in recent times. Things started with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) recording incredible numbers in the first quarter of 2021, with as much as $10 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter.\n\nNews of all-time highs floods the media, with some people doubling or even 23x their earnings, making mind-boggling amounts of money in a short amount of time.\n\nIn addition to unbelievable earnings, the rise of meme coins is another unique thing about this current bull run.\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t the first time meme coins are popping up, but it\u2019s safe to say that this is the first time we\u2019re seeing them in this magnitude. In fact, the first African themed meme coin, Wakanda Inu, has just been launched. But what are these meme coins, and are they worth the hype?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are meme coins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Old Money on Unsplash\n\nMeme coins are related to memes, those funny videos, pictures, or texts that reference a particular social or cultural phenomenon. The trending \u201cI wan dey do now\u201d is an excellent example.\n\nIn simple terms, meme coins are crypto tokens inspired by social media trends, jokes, or movies.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 250 meme coins, including Dodgelon Mars, Safemoon Inu, SHIBA INU, SHIBAVAX, Loser Coin, Rotten, and DogeZilla.\n\nFrom their names, it\u2019s possible to tell what some meme coins stand for.\n\nAlthough there are hundreds of meme coins, those referred to as OG (original gangster) meme coins are the most popular with the highest market capitalisation.\n\nThe biggest OG is Dogecoin, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation of $35.6 billion.\n\nSHIBA INU, which has been touted as the Dogecoin killer, is the second biggest with a market capitalisation of $28.29 billion, sitting two places below Dogecoin.\n\nInterestingly there\u2019s now an African-themed meme coin \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 made to create wealth for Africans. Currently ranked 2818 with a market cap of $26.8 million, Wakanda Inu is far from being an OG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Clay Banks on Unsplash\n\nHowever, supporters of the token are bullish about its growth, despite its ranking, with many claiming to have made a lot of money from the token.\n\nWhile meme tokens might be a product of social media trends with no fundamental use case backing them, they have recorded enormous growth and made their hodlers a lot of money.\n\nSide note: Hodl is a crypto term derived from misspelling \u2018hold\u2019; it also means \u2018holding on for dear life\u2019. It is a strategy where a coin is held for the long term for higher gains.\n\nHowever, investing in them still poses risks.\n\nMeme coins might make you a lot of money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Crystal Mapes on Unsplash\n\nSome people, like Glauber Contessoto, aka Slumdoge Millionaire, who became a millionaire with Dogecoin, have publicly revealed how much they\u2019ve made from meme coins.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, he invested $250,000 in Dogecoins when a unit was worth $0.045 (4.5 cents). He became a millionaire two months later, on April 15, 2021. Contessoto told CBNC that he invested because of the strong community behind Dogecoin and Elon Musk\u2019s backing of the coin.\n\nThe Doge Millionaire believes that the coin will build him generational wealth.\n\nHowever, he lost his millionaire status after the value of Dogecoin decreased. Nevertheless, Contessoto remains bullish about the meme coin, refusing to sell and even more.\n\nDogecoin isn\u2019t the only meme coin making people millionaires. SHIBA INU also has its millionaires.\n\nAccording to Fortune, a man identified simply as Rob made an $8,000 bet on SHIBA INU and immediately retired after earning a million dollars on his bet.\n\nCNN also told the story of two brothers \u2014 Tommy and James \u2014 who invested in the Dogecoin killer and made a killing from it. The brothers also convinced other family members to invest in the coin. Before long, the family\u2019s $7,900 investment was worth almost $9 million.\n\nIn October, SHIBA INU was able to unseat Dogecoin as the biggest OG in the meme coin universe, gaining nearly 900,000,000% since it was created in August 2020.\n\nWhile meme coins have made people overnight millionaires, that is not always the case.\n\nYou can lose a lot of money with meme coins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nairametrics\n\nThe release of the Korean hit series Squid Game, in September, was the beginning of another massive Internet trend. The series became Netflix\u2019s biggest hit show, with over 130 million watches globally in October.\n\nThe record-breaking series made headlines, inspiring a lot of viral content in the process.\n\nThe series also spurred a meme token \u2014 the SQUID Token \u2014 that took advantage of all the noise the hit series created.\n\nThe timing was perfect, and the coin took off because Squid Game was perhaps the most popular thing on the Internet at the time\n\nAccording to the coin\u2019s whitepaper, it was built just like the series. It contained several games to be played by coin hodlers; however, instead of playing for their lives, hodlers played to earn coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series: Sqid Game. Source: BBC\n\nThe rise of the SQUID token was meteoric; it got a lot of attention and made headlines, increasing its popularity and the rally behind it.\n\nAn October 28, 2021, CNBC headline read, There\u2019s a \u2018Squid Game\u2019 cryptocurrency \u2013 and it\u2019s up nearly 2,400% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIt was a juicy coin and everyone wanted in on the action until the creators switched from green lights to red and decided it was time to cash out.\n\nAccording to WIRED, the media failed to point out that there were no ties between the Squid Game Netflix series and the coin.\n\nThe coin went from less than a dollar to $600 per coin, and many hodlers saw themselves as theoretical millionaires. The reality, however, was that they just partook in a huge two-week-long scam.\n\nThe hodlers of the coin couldn\u2019t sell it, which meant they had no way to liquidate their earnings if the price of the token fell. Although the red flags were all too evident, it was already too late to do anything.\n\nThe creators dumped their hodlings, bringing the token, which reached a value of about $2,860 per token in less than two weeks, to almost zero.\n\nPerpetrators of the \u2018rug pull\u2019 scam were estimated to have made away with at least $3.9 million, according to BscScan.\n\nAlthough scams like this paint meme coins in a bad light, the continued existence of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU signals that they might not all be out to get you broke, but how can you tell?\n\nNew meme coins are constantly being created, and it\u2019s getting increasingly hard to differentiate what\u2019s real from what\u2019s not. For example, the new African-themed meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 named after a fictional African city \u2014 Wakanda \u2014 in the movie the Black Panther is on the rise and rallying strongly.\n\nAlthough the token has the backing of popular Nigerian crypto trader and tutor, Chris Ani, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and even well-meaning meme coins might not fly.\n\nThe African meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWakanda Inu home page\n\nAccording to the token\u2019s whitepaper, \u201cWakanda Inu is a community meme project forged from the deep and warm consciousness of humanity.\u201d\n\nIt says it is \u201ca decentralized meme token to drive growth in the industry, decentralized finance-oriented activities across the world.\n\nBe a pioneer on this mission. Wakanda Inu will outperform every meme coin out there. We are well on our way to inevitable widespread adoption.\u201d\n\nThe whitepaper also reveals that the token will drive charity oriented activities across the world.\n\nAs a community-driven token, the public will decide what happens with the token and which projects to embark upon.\n\nIt is simply a token created to enrich Africans through their collective efforts.\n\nWhile Wakanda Inu means well for Africans, one of the most crucial points to look out for in a token is utility which it doesn\u2019t seem to have yet.\n\nAccording to Mint, experts believe that rather than communities, a token should be backed by fundamentals, also known as utilities or use cases.\n\nFor example, many protocols have been built on the Ethereum network because it has the technology to help NFTs and DeFi, among others, work.\n\nMeme tokens, on the other hand, exist because of a trend and grow in value as long as more people buy and hodl it.\n\nSidharth Sogani, Founder and CEO of Crebaco Global, a crypto and blockchain-focused research, rating, and intelligence company, says meme coins \u201care just community tokens. These are pump and dump coins, which don\u2019t have any use cases.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dogecoin, which started as a meme coin, is working on a use case.\n\nAccording to Market Insider, the American movie theatre could start accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment.\n\nThe SHIBA INU whitepaper has also shown that the token\u2019s ecosystem will contain ShibaSwap, a DeFi platform that will facilitate crypto trading.\n\nWakanda Inu\u2019s whitepaper states that a DeFi platform or NFT farming staking platform could be in the works depending on what the community chooses to build.\n\nHowever, the token is still entirely dependent on the community to grow any form of value.\n\nIn addition to use cases, a YouTuber, Mentoraa\u2019s World, pointed out other red flags within the Wakanda Inu infrastructure.\n\nHe discovered an address that held 8.6775% of the Wakanda Inu token. According to the YouTuber, no wallet address is supposed to be holding up to 4% of a particular token. If the address decides to dump the token, it could adversely affect its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallets holding Wakanda Inu on BscScan\n\nHe analysed the token with Token Sniffer, a website that analyses the risk level of a token, and it was ranked highly risky.\n\nThere were also anomalies within the token\u2019s source code that could allow the transfer of the tokens to be halted. This means hodlers might not be able to transfer the token.\n\nHowever, the analysis by the website is experimental and isn\u2019t 100% accurate.\n\nIt is important to note that crypto tokens have become increasingly easy to make, increasing the probability of encountering scam tokens.\n\nTherefore, adequate research is necessary before investing in crypto, especially meme coins.\n\nAs the rally behind Wakanda Inu grows, time is perhaps the only factor that can reveal where it is headed.\n\nDisclaimer: The contents of this article are not financial advice.

          "title": "Global startup, Healthlane, launches its world-class preventive healthcare facilities in Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has been plagued with tough health challenges. With its healthcare system poorly developed, the life expectancy rate in the continent currently lies at 63 years for males and 66 years for females. Much lower than the global average of 71 for males and 73 for females.\n\nTo help tackle a part of this problem, Alain Nteff launched Giftedmom in 2012 and he pivoted the company in 2019 to become Healthlane. The startup now offers a wide range of services to Africans.\n\nIn September 2020, the company raised $2.4 million to expand its offerings, stating that it had some interesting moves in the works.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 9, 2021, Healthlane, announced its official launch in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorthy of note is the fact that the life expectancy in Nigeria is lower than the continental average with 59 to 63 years for males and females respectively, but that might soon be changing.\n\nAt an event hosted at the immaculate Healthlane office in Lekki, Lagos Nigeria, Alain Nteff, alongside key Healthlane executives and notable clients shared Healthlane\u2019s vision to use technology to improve healthcare in Nigeria and the benefits of the Healthlane experience.\n\nTo kickstart the event, Folu Olumideko, Head, Marketing and Communications gave a welcome speech highlighting the company\u2019s mission to simplify how people track and optimise their health.\n\nTaking up the baton, Healthlane founder and Managing Director, Alain Nteff thanked the team and the clients for the successful launch of the Healthlane app and its world-class healthcare technology to help people live longer and healthy lives.\n\n\u201cI remember in 2019 I knew preventive care was important, but I had no feasibility. No idea about the pricing, and sometimes when you meet the doctor, he asks you what symptoms you\u2019re having so he can prescribe a test. Comprehensive checkup was not really a thing at that time,\u201d he says.\n\nAlain also pointed out that most of those heavily affected by COVID-19 were those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\n\u201cBefore 2020, my mom fell sick regularly, and the hospital kept treating typhoid and malaria. I now realised that I had to take her for comprehensive checkups. In 2020, she was one of those that we lost from conditions that could have been prevented. And that was the turning point for us, and we said we need to make preventive care something big in the coming years.\u201d\n\nHe also states that before Healthlane, what we usually call healthcare is actually \u201csick care\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re sick, you go to the doctor, give them your symptoms, and they give you prescriptions. That\u2019s what sick care is,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cToday at Healthlane, we believe healthcare is about eating well, exercising, supplementing, having checkups, and immunising yourself. If we get this right, then we should be helping everyone live like 20 \u2013 30 years extra and not lose loved ones to preventable illnesses,\u201d he added.\n\nAlain announced that Healthlane has consulted with top health experts across the globe on what would be the right healthcare practices to help people live longer, and he excitedly revealed that the company has been able to execute this with the aid of technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve birthed a world-class lab on-site, and it reports that it has conducted over 70 tests. Apart from doing just tests, we also help identify ways to optimise what has been found or reverse a condition that has been found. We are also launching the Healthlane app which keeps records and implements healthcare plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, people are now comfortable accessing their medical records on their smartphones. They are more concerned about preventing themselves so they don\u2019t fall prey to certain diseases. We all know that if you are diabetic or hypertensive, you are more affected if you contract Covid-19 compared to someone who is relatively healthy. There is a growing trend of services being deployed through technology and that is where we have positioned ourselves,\u201d Nteff asserts.\n\nBuilding affordable healthcare\n\nBuilding on Alain\u2019s introduction, Dr Lincoln Saiki, one of Healthlane\u2019s in-house physicians, presented a live case study of an individual who looks seemingly healthy to the average observer but had hidden symptoms that could only be revealed through a comprehensive checkup like Healthlane\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAs of today, 1 in 17 Nigerians have diabetes, 1 in five Nigerians suffer from obesity, and 1 in 3 Nigerians have high blood pressure and hypertension. You might be wondering how it\u2019s possible to have 75 million Nigerians with hypertension, but it is one of the silent killers. People might have it for years without symptoms and only when it manifests in the form of strokes, heart attack, heart failure, or kidney failure. To date, it remains the largest cause of preventable deaths.\u201d Lincoln revealed.\n\nThe doctor explained that Healthlane provides up to 78 different tests, and the results are normally out in 45 minutes. The company also helps to create a feeding, supplement or exercising plan from the result of the test.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s a body analysis which shows parameters like age, weight, height, body fat among others.\n\nThis follows the Baseline checks which involves Heart Health, Diabetes check, Immunity, Kidney Health, Liver Health, Blood, Cancer check, Hormones, Bones and Minerals.\n\nFinally, the company creates a care plan using the insights from the test.\n\nHealthlane\u2019s product manager, Karen Onigbinde, explained that the Healthlane app, which is available on the Google and Apple app stores, makes it easy for people to make the lifestyle changes that are required for them to live long and healthy.\n\n\u201cWe have features that let you access your wellness checks, so you can schedule and pay for your wellness appointments, your vaccinations, and your supplements from the Google app. You can also track your health data, and also download them in case you want to consult a second opinion. You also manage your health with a care plan which contains those reminders that tell you to drink water, eat well, and exercise\u201d she detailed.\n\nKaren also revealed that Healthlane would be building a lot more features that will help people access healthier food or make it easier to get on the healthlane.\n\nTestimonials\n\nMost tellingly, one of Healthlane\u2019s clients, Buchi, a fitness expert who loved to keep fit and take care of his health decided to do a comprehensive check with Healthlane, and found out he had deficiencies he didn\u2019t know about. The company then went on to create a distinct healthcare plan to suit his needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to say I work hard, I\u2019m fit, I don\u2019t have any medical issues, but you never know what\u2019s going on inside of you. I found that my Vitamin D was low, but I\u2019ve had an amazing experience with Healthlane to help adjust this issue.\n\nAnother client, Nadayar Enegesi, CEO of Eden Life also praised the Healthlane experience, pointing out that he had always been wary of hospitals and had never tried to do any check ups even when recommended.\n\n\u201cI was just amazed at the experience. There were about 78 tests that were run, and I really appreciated the detail that the solution went to educate me about what is going on in my body. We worked through the care plan and I got some supplements. I was also advised to change my diet to include more fruits and nuts,\u201d he briefly recounted.\n\nAre the services affordable?\n\nThe company offers a wide range of affordable wellness products for individuals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed up health insurance services providers like Hygeia HMO and Reliance HMO and anyone covered by them can access our healthcare services,\u201d said Damola Ajayi, Healthlane\u2019s head of Sales and Business Development.\n\nShe then revealed that there are three affordable pricing packages available.\n\nThere\u2019s the:\n\nWorld-class check where you do as much as 95 tests for just \u20a6135,000 ($325)\n\nExecutive check which is just \u20a649,000 ($149) for 69 checks\n\nPremium package which is just \u20a628,000 ($68) for 43 checks.\n\nThere are also corporate and HMO plans.\n\nShe also explained that Healthlane offers mobile labs for companies who want to test their employees at their offices.\n\nAddressing Techpoint Africa\u2019s inquiry at the Press Q&A session, Alain explained that Healthlane\u2019s services are already gaining traction with a good number of working professionals in Lagos, Nigeria, and he expects the company to gradually expand to other locations in the near future.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

He built a thriving business empire and diversified into different fields. Some of the businesses he owned are Dansa Foods Limited, Dansa Energy, Sagas Energy Limited, Bulk Pack Services Limited, Dansa Agro Allied Limited, and Dangote Farms Limited.\n\nHis deep interest in agriculture is expressed in the nature of companies he set up, which were focused on farming and agro-processing, as well as in the fertilizer business.

          "title": "Inflation: How NBS figures contradict market realities \u2013 Survey",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nDespite complaints of surges in the prices of goods and services by Nigerians, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday disclosed that the nations\u2019 inflation rate fell to 15.99 per cent in October, from 16.36 in September.\n\nAccording to its Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, the October figure showed a steady decline in the country\u2019s inflation rate over a seven month period beginning from April.\n\nThe headline inflation, driven by soaring food prices, had accelerated consistently for about three years, hitting 18.17 per cent in March. But since April, the rise in inflation has been slower, according to NBS statistics.\n\nThere have been reports of skyrocketing food prices in major cities across the country in recent times with adverse effects on household budgets. This has been majorly attributed to rising insecurity in the country, especially in the North and some other states where most of the essential food items for the nation come from.\n\nExpectedly, some economists and other stakeholders have dismissed the position of NBS, saying the bureau needed to do more to convince Nigerians, especially those who rely on their data for research and critical decision-making, that the figures are not doctored to achieve a predetermined objective.\n\nAccording to a market survey conducted by The Guardian, the cost of protein had increased by almost 100 per cent in the last one year, just like certain plant-based food crops such as beans.\n\nIn Lagos, a crate of eggs (30 units) in most supermarkets sells for between N1,800 and N2,150. On the street, the price has also increased from N1,200 in 2020 to between N1,700 and N2,200 depending on the size. That puts the year-on-year (YoY) increase at approximately 62 per cent.\n\nA kilogramme of chicken laps has also increased by over 60 per cent YoY. The commodity, which cost about N1500 about a year again now goes for about N2,400 at popular supermarkets, while a whole chicken sells for N5,000. A live chicken (old layer) costs about N2,500-N3,000 and a broiler costs a minimum of N5,000 in many live chicken markets in Lagos.\n\nAt a popular supermarket in Lagos, an 800-900gm sachet of milk is between N2,300 and N3,000, depending on the brand. About a year ago, the price of the essential commodity was in the range of N1,700 and N2,000.\n\nA kilogramme of Titus fish is currently N1,600 just as Croaker fish is N2,500 as against the average price of N850, implying that fish has increased by over 100 per cent in the past year.\n\nThe survey, however, revealed that only the price of beans, as a plant-based source of protein, has reduced significantly in the last two months as new harvests hit the market.\n\nAt Daleko market, Lagos, a bag of brown beans was N50,000 last month. But it has dropped to N32,000, while a big bag of sweet beans also fell from N105,000 last month to N75,000. The price of a small bag of white beans also slowed from N90,000 last month to N65,000.\n\nIn Ibadan, Oyo State, findings revealed that a crate of medium-sized eggs costs about N1,700, while a crate of big eggs is sold for between N1,900 and N2,000. The same price range applies in Kwara State. But in Abuja, a crate of eggs is about N2,500, while a kilogramme of chicken is about N3,000. The percentage increase across markets is between 40 and 70 per cent.\n\nA medium-sized tuber of yam is N1,200 in a popular supermarket in Lagos while it costs about N1,000 on the street. A similar size of yam sold for about N700, or about 40 per cent less than the current price in open markets a year ago.\n\nIt is a similar trend for groundnut oil and onion. A bag of onion, for instance, has increased by over 70 per cent, with a five-litre groundnut oil increase from N4,000 to N7,000 at popular markets. Onion, though at a slower speed than oil, has increased by over 30 per cent YoY.\n\nA professor of applied economics, Godwin Owoh, described the inflation figures as unusable, saying they were doctored to fulfill some political objectives. He said the figures would fall apart when subjected to professional scrutiny by an independent body.\n\nFor Prof. Leo Ukpong of the American University of Nigeria (AUN), the reason consumers could not feel the drop in inflation was that the average things that consumers buy are either not included in the basket of goods used in the calculation of the CPI or very little is included in the index.\n\nAlso reacting, a former President of Trade Union Congress (TUC), Peter Esele, wondered the metrics used by the NBS to measure the inflation rate.\n\nEsele said: \u201cI am sure many Nigerians will be asking if those working in the NBS come from the moon. Even the price of naira, which is the exchange rate, has gone up. The price of cooking gas has gone up by more than 100 per cent. The price of every commodity in the market has gone through the roof. So, I ask the NBS, what metrics did they use?\u201d\n\nEsele pointed out that if the prices of goods and services are rising at a faster rate in America, Britain as well as in all of Europe while it is in reverse in Nigeria, it suggests that Nigeria has a different definition of what inflation rate is.\n\n\u201cWhy is the price of cooking gas going up? That is the trend in the international market. The British government is subsidising gas now because winter is here.

Danbatta re-emphasised the confidence of Management in the continuous support of its Board of Commissioners towards actualising the set targets and goals for advancing the growth of the telecoms industry.\n\nOn his part, Prof. Akande said the Board will \u2018go to the drawing table\u2019 in ensuring the commission is well positioned to deliver on its mandates, promising that the board will work on issues that will help strengthen the regulator to deliver more effectively on its mandates.\n\nSpeaking at the wrap-up ceremony of the retreat, which started on Thursday, November 11, 2021, at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja and ended on Saturday, November 13, 2021, Danbatta expressed confidence in the leadership of the Board of the Commission, noting that the support of the Board has been invaluable in the accomplishments of the Commission.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, \u201cI must commend the board of commissioners under the chairmanship of Prof. Adeolu Akande for their support. From the first day of assuming office as NCC chairman, Prof. Akande has demonstrated his commitment to work with the management towards ensuring that NCC delivers its functions more efficiently and effectively.\u201d\n\nDanbatta stated that, as an effective, efficient and independent regulatory agency of the federal government, the NCC has been consistent in living up to stakeholder expectations and this is proven by the contribution of the telecom sector to the national economy.\n\n\u201cWithout the staunch support of the board for the management\u2019s vision and mission, it would have been difficult for us to achieve our goals. Therefore, I commend the Board for providing the necessary policy directions required to drive management\u2019s daily activities,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\nDanbatta also appreciated the effective coordination of the 2021 BMR by the retreat consultants led by Prof. Pat Utomi, in ensuring effective facilitation of proceedings, deliberations and brainstorming sessions at the Retreat.\n\nWith the theme: \u2018Expect More, Deliver Result\u2019, this year\u2019s strategic annual retreat of the Commission\u2019s BMR was attended in-person and virtually by Board members and Senior Management Staff of the Commission.\n\nThe retreat follows the unveiling of two key documents \u2013 the Strategic Management Plan (SMP), 2020-2024, and the Strategic Vision Plan (SVP), 2021-2025. The SVP is a streamlined version of the SMP, and the SMP took life out of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS),2020-2030), the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025 and the Federation Government\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP).",

          "text": "About a year after the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) called of its industrial action, the union has warned that its members may be forced to resume another round of strike if the federal government didn\u2019t honour the agreements reached with ASUU.\n\nSpecifically, they said the strike would be embarked upon in view of the \u201cgovernment\u2019s unfaithfulness\u201d in implementation of the Memorandum of Action (MoU) it signed with the union upon which the last strike action was suspended.\n\nThe union called off its nine-month old strike December 2020 after which it entered into an agreement with the federal government.\n\nAnnouncing plan to resume fresh strike, the body said its members would withdraw its service for another round of industrial action.\n\nASUU National President Professor Emmanuel Osodeke stated this at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the University of Abuja between November 13 and 14.\n\nThey said governments should be held responsible if they failed to address the issues within three weeks.\n\nASUU said despite its meeting with Minister of Labour and Employment Senator Chris Ngige on 14th October, 2021, on the major outstanding issues, including funding for revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS), promotion arrears, renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement, and the inconsistencies in IPPIS payment, the issues still remained unresolved.\n\n\u201cASUU is fully committed to upholding academic integrity in our universities and working to make them more globally competitive. We are equally committed to promoting industrial harmony in the Nigerian university system for as long as all stakeholders are willing and committed to play their parts.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Vice-Chancellors, as the main drivers of the system, to join us in this mission to safeguard the waning image of our universities. They have no business trading honorary degrees and academic positions for personal and immediate gains; thereby smearing the collective integrity of committed scholars and other patriots who are working day and night to uplift the system that produced them.\n\n\u201cOur union shall not shy away from taking the fight to administrators of Nigerian universities as well as internal and external agents who are bent on compromising the standard ASUU has consistently laboured to protect and improve.\n\n\u201cFinally, we call on all patriotic Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria to prevail on the federal and state governments to act fast to prevent another round of industrial crisis in Nigeria\u2019s public universities.\n\n\u201cIt is painful that our Union may soon have no other way of securing the implementation of FGN-ASUU collectively bargained agreements and redressing the criminal neglect of welfare issues of our members by State Governors. Governments of\n\nNigerian should be held responsible should ASUU be forced to activate the strike it patriotically suspended,\u201d Osodeke said.\n\nOn the controversy around the professorial status of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami as a Professor at the Federal University of Technology (FUTO) Owerri, ASUU said it was not convinced.\n\nThe FUTO chapter of the union had said standard processes were followed in Pantami\u2019s appointment as Professor of Cyber Security in the university following an investigation by the panel.\n\nStating the position of the national body, Osodeke said: \u201cThe controversy this appointment has generated is unprecedented in the recent history of Nigerian universities. Indeed, it has generated passionate comments and responses from individuals and groups within and outside the nation.\u201d\n\nContinuing, ASUU said: \u201cThe controversy centres on the perceived roles played by the university administration in the alleged fraudulent appointment, and the subsequent seeming endorsement by the ASUU branch at FUTO. Consequently, some media commentators \u2013 print, electronic and social have impugned that the national body of ASUU was in agreement with the position of ASUU FUTO branch on the said appointment.\n\n\u201cNothing could be farther from the truth. ASUU, as a Union has never supported, promoted or endorsed any illegal appointment or promotion of academics in any Nigerian University, including those of its members. As a Union, we have always insisted on strict adherence to due process and the rule of law in all aspects of university administration and governance.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, the union rejected the ASUU-FUTO Committee\u2019s report and set up an independent committee to investigate all issues surrounding the controversial appointment of Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) as a Professor of Cyber Security in the University.\u201d\n\n\u201cThereafter, the position of ASUU-NEC shall be made known to the public. In addition, another committee shall visit the ASUU-FUTO branch with a view to determining the role of members in the controversial appointment and report back to NEC for further action,\u201d ASUU further added.\n\nOn insecurity, the union said: \u201cThere is need for government to ensure porous borders around the North-west and North-east to mitigate the spread of terrorists and bandits from neighbouring countries, and increase political will and determination to end insecurity to disprove the popular clich\u00e9 that \u2018if I security lasts for more than 24 hours, the government has a hand in it.\u201d",

Itunnu went ahead to file charges against him and allegedly used a different name to file the case and somehow, a case of robbery which she filed mysteriously turned to a case of human trafficking against her.\n\n\u201cShe was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment while the Nigerian mission in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, supported by the Nigerian community, got her a lawyer, paid part payment of legal fees for the lawyer to appeal the judgment, while at the same time seeking diplomatic intervention.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Death Toll Rises To 45 In Ikoyi Building Collapse\n\nAccording to NIDCOM, staff of the Nigerian mission had visited Itunnu in prison situated in the hinterland \u2013 a distance of over four hours from Abidjan.\n\nWhile the appeal case was ongoing, Itunnu was said to have complications from diabetes and was rushed to the hospital.\n\nThe fee for her treatment, according to the agency, was paid by the Nigerian mission through the lawyer whose services were engaged by the mission.\n\nBut the lady later died after a few days of admission at the hospital.\n\n\u201cHer death will, however, not stop the appeal in court in order to vindicate her of the charges against her,\u201d Dabiri-Erewa said.",

None of my children is working with Oyo State Government to say that that is whom we are fighting for but for the generality of the Muslims. A Muslim who wakes up and does not wish for the progress of his fellow Muslims is not worthy of calling a Muslim\u201d\n\nAlhaji Sanni said the Muslim Community is apolitical but what has always been its business is fairness and equality to all religions by the State government.\n\n\u201d We are not APC. What is the difference between APC and PDP? Are they not the same? Our interest is what is due for the Muslims, give it to us and do the same to the Christians but there must not be injustice at all\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Barrister Abdulrahman Abdulraheem said the case of some foreign missionaries attached to Evangelist Daniel Kolenda visiting some public schools to preach would not be swept under the carpet.\n\nHe explained that thorough investigations were on to know how the team gained access into the schools without due process.\n\n\u201cThere have been an existing circular regarding religious activities in schools which we update from time to time. If there is any visitor to our schools, even if they want to donate materials there, after meeting the principals, they must get approvals from the Ministry before such visitors could address the students. We don\u2019t allow students to interact with visitors without observing the protocols.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident rally baffled us in the Ministry and personally I have sleepless nights on the case and we have taken a lot of steps which I might not be able to reveal now but I\u2019m assuring you that the case\n\nwill not be swept under the carpets. We must check such excesses. \u201d\n\nThe Commissioner exonerated both the Chairman and Permanent Secretary of the State Teaching Service Commission, TESCOM from the incident stressing that they were not pre-informed of the visits to schools by the Evangelist Kolenda\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cThough, both the Chairman and the Permanent Secretary of TESCOM are Christians but the truth is that they were not responsible for the incident. They are innocent regarding the matter\u201d.\n\nBarrister Abdraheem explained that measures had also been adopted to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future emphasising that excesses like preaching in schools would be checked.\n\n\u201cWe will make necessary amendments and forgive us and we are assuring you that such will not happen again\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw their letter of apology, I was happy but when there was a report the following day of another visit, it really saddened my heart but we have taken different steps and you will soon see the result\u201d.\n\nHe confirmed the receipt of the letter by Muslim Students\u2019 Society of Nigeria on the development explaining that he has had an interaction with the executives of the body on the situation.\n\nThe Commissioner noted that in line with the open door policy of Engr Seyi Makinde\u2019s administration, his office is always open urging people to channel their complaints directly to him rather than going on social media.\n\nCommissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr Wasiu Olatubosun explained that Governor Seyi Makinde would continue to be fair to all religions noting that out of the 17 new commissioners, 9 are Muslims while 8 are Christians.\n\nHe called for continuous prayers for the success of Governor Makinde in line \u201cwith Prophet Muhammad\u2019s instructions that we should pray for our leaders\u201d\n\nThe Chairman on the occasion, Professor Rashid Aderinoye enjoined NACOMYO and other Islamic organisations not to be far from their representatives in government stressing that their regular interaction would resolve many agitations.\n\nIn a lecture by Imam Habeebulahi Buhari, the Islamic cleric enjoined the Muslim political office holders to ensure the fear of Allah in all their dealings while workings in the cause of Allah should also be paramount in their undertakings.\n\nEarlier, the coordinator, NACOMYO, Oyo State Chapter, Alhaji Dawood Afolabi\u013a said it has become the tradition of the Chapter to organise a prayer reception for Muslim political appointees and other personalities in order to team up to advance the cause of Islam.\n\nHe emphasized that no individual could buy NACOMYO as the organisation stands for justice and fair treatment adding that as long as the government played its part, there would not be cause for any clash.\n\nCommissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Titles, Chief Bayo Lawal was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr. Bashir Olanrewaju while the Commissioner for Women Affairs, Alhaja Kafilah Omolabake Olayiwola also has a representative at the reception.\n\nOther political functionaries in attendance are Chairman, Oyo State Civil Service Commission, Alhaji Kamorudeen Aderibigbe Chairman Ibadan North Local Government, Hon.

          "text": "The US has condemned Russia for conducting a \u201cdangerous and irresponsible\u201d missile test that it says endangered the crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe test blew up one of Russia\u2019s own satellites, creating debris that forced the ISS crew to shelter in capsules.\n\nThe station currently has seven crew members on board \u2013 four Americans, a German and two Russians.\n\nThe space station orbits at an altitude of about 420km (260 miles).\n\n\u201cEarlier today, the Russian Federation recklessly conducted a destructive satellite test of a direct ascent anti-satellite missile against one of its own satellites,\u201d US state department spokesman Ned Price said at a briefing.\n\n\u201cThe test has so far generated over 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris that now threaten the interests of all nations.\u201d\n\nNasa administrator Bill Nelson said he was outraged at the incident.\n\n\u201cWith its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts\u201d as well as Chinese \u201ctaikonauts\u201d aboard China\u2019s space station, he said in a statement.\n\nRussian space agency Roscosmos downplayed the incident.\n\n\u201cThe orbit of the object, which forced the crew today to move into spacecraft according to standard procedures, has moved away from the ISS orbit. The station is in the green zone,\u201d the agency tweeted.\n\nThe wayward material passed by without incident, but its origin is now under the spotlight.\n\nIt appears to have come from a broken-up Russian satellite, Kosmos-1408. A spy satellite launched in 1982, it weighed over a tonne and had ceased working many years ago.\n\nLeoLabs, a space debris-tracking company, said its radar facility in New Zealand had picked up multiple objects where the long-defunct spacecraft should have been.\n\nMr Price described the Russian action as \u201cdangerous and irresponsible\u201d and said it demonstrated the country\u2019s \u201cclaims of opposing weaponisation of space are disingenuous and hypocritical.\n\n\u201cThe US will work with our partners and allies to respond to their irresponsible act,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the test \u201cshows a complete disregard for the security, safety and sustainability of space\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe debris resulting from this test will remain in orbit putting satellites and human spaceflight at risk for years to come,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to view anti-satellite missile tests as a form of madness.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to control the debris field that results from a high-velocity impact. Thousands of fragments are produced. Some will be propelled downwards towards Earth and out of harm\u2019s way, but many will also head to higher altitudes where they will harass operational missions for years into the future \u2013 including those of the nation state that carried out the test.\n\nWhat must the Russian cosmonauts on the space station have been thinking when they took shelter in their Soyuz capsule early on Monday because of the risk debris from this test might intersect with their orbital home?\n\nSpace junk is a rapidly worsening situation. Sixty-four years of activity above our heads means there are now roughly a million objects running around up there uncontrolled in the size range of 1cm (0.4in) to 10cm.\n\nAn impact from any one of these could be mission-ending for a vital weather or telecommunications satellite. Nations need to be clearing up the space environment, not polluting it still further.\n\nA number of countries have the ability to take out satellites from the ground, including the US, Russia, China and India.\n\nTesting of such missiles is rare, but always draws widespread condemnation whenever it occurs, because it pollutes the space environment for everyone.\n\nWhen China destroyed one of its retired weather satellites in 2007, it created more than 2,000 pieces of trackable debris. This material posed an ongoing hazard to operational space missions, not least those of China itself.\n\nBrian Weeden, an expert in space situational awareness, earlier said that if it was confirmed Russia had conducted a test that endangered the ISS, the conduct would have been \u201cbeyond irresponsible\u201d.\n\nThe space station occupies an orbital shell that other operators try to keep clear of hardware, either working or retired.\n\nHowever, the astronauts are increasingly having to take precautionary measures when fragments from old satellites and rockets come uncomfortably close.\n\nThe velocities at which this material moves means it could easily puncture the walls of the station\u2019s modules.\n\nPrecautionary measures usually involve closing hatches between the modules, and, as happened on Monday, climbing into the capsules that took the astronauts up to the station. These vehicles stay attached to the ISS throughout the crews\u2019 tours of duty in case there is a need for a rapid \u201clifeboat\u201d escape.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden called for better and more \u201chonest\u201d communication between China and the US during a virtual call with Chinese President Xi Jinping where both leaders played up their close relationship.\n\nThe two leaders were holding discussions over video conference at a time when the two countries\u2019 relationship is deteriorating over issues including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Beijing\u2019s treatment of the predominantly Muslim Uighurs in its far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nIn his opening remarks ahead of the call on Monday night in the US, Biden acknowledged that competition between the US and China was expected but said it was his and Xi\u2019s personal responsibility as leaders to ensure that rivalry did not veer into conflict, according to a White House transcript.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me we need to establish some common sense guardrails, to be clear and honest where we disagree, and work together where our interests intersect, especially on vital global issues like climate change,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s very important, as I\u2019ve told other world leaders when they ask about our relationship, is that we have always communicated with one another \u2014 with one another very honestly and candidly,\u201d he also said. \u201cWe never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments contrast with the early days of his administration when a meeting in March between top US and Chinese officials turned into an acrimonious confrontation as Yang Jiechi, China\u2019s top diplomat and a member of the Politburo, told Secretary of State Antony Blinken not to meddle in China\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nXi and Biden have met several times before. Monday\u2019s virtual meeting is their first since Biden took office in January and comes amid deteriorating ties between the two countries [File: Lintao Zhang/Pool via AP Photo]\n\nSince then, the Biden administration and Beijing have traded barbs over sensitive topics, including recent Chinese incursions into Taiwan\u2019s Air Defence Identification Zone. China claims the island, a self-ruled democracy of more than 23 million people, as its own, while the US views it as a key ally in its Indo-Pacific defence strategy.\n\nDuring the vcall with Xi, Biden said the US opposes \u201cunilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d according to a White House statement.\n\nThe US maintains a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d towards Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, but since the Trump Administration, US officials are increasingly outspoken offering assistance to the democracy in an event of an attack.\n\n\u201cThey are moving towards strategic clarity, although the official policy will not abandon \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019 in the short term. Biden has already talked about this several times and then reports from the Pentagon also stressed that the US they must \u2018deter\u2019 China\u2019s use of force,\u201d said Fang-Yu Chen, an assistant professor of Political Science at Soochow University in Taiwan. \u201cIt is very clear that US is concerned about the Taiwan Strait.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from Beijing, Xi said the two countries faced multiple challenges.\n\nHe referred to Biden as \u201cmy old friend,\u201d and said the rivals must work more closely together. \u201cChina and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s state media noted the \u201cfriendly tone\u201d of the opening of the discussions, and reflected the \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d between the two leaders, Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, told the state-run Global Times. The two men previously met in person while each was serving as vice president under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hu Jintao respectively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare for heads of state to have such a long conversation, and such a good relationship is seen as a positive condition for handling bilateral ties,\u201d Wu told the paper.\n\nThe virtual summit lasted for more than three and a half hours, wrapping up shortly before 12.30pm (04:30 GMT) Beijing time, according to Chinese state media.\n\nThe two leaders have spoken by phone twice since Biden\u2019s inauguration in January, but Xi has not travelled overseas since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, ruling out the chance of a face-to-face meeting.\n\nChen said he did not expect the largely ceremonial meeting would have a major impact on US-China relations, but it did show how US policy towards China had changed to viewing the country as a potentially risky competitor.\n\n\u201cMany, many analysts say that is the first time that the US is not pretending to be (friends.) The US is, frankly speaking, trying to contain China,\u201d Chen said. \u201cSince the Trump administration\u2019s trade war and now with the Biden administration (we see the US) taking a full government-approach to try to compete with China. So it is a very clear trend, and I don\u2019t see any change, even though there are some meetings or conferences, in the US China policy.\u201d\n\nIn a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ahead of the talks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted Taiwan as a critical point of contention between the two countries.",

          "text": "The Dutch government on Monday launched an eleventh-hour attempt to keep Shell in the Netherlands by seeking to abolish a controversial dividend tax cited by the energy group as reason to unify its share structure and move its headquarters to the UK.\n\nOfficials from the Dutch government told the Financial Times that the caretaker government of Mark Rutte was seeking to find a last-minute parliamentary majority to scrap a 15 per cent withholding tax that has long been a source of complaint for Shell and fellow Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever.\n\nThe political machinations came hours after Shell announced it would end its dual share structure and shift its entire tax base to the UK, but the Dutch government said the announcement was an \u201cunwelcome surprise\u201d and is now scrambling to keep Shell from leaving.\n\nEarlier this year, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden cited the Netherlands\u2019 failure to abolish the dividend tax as a potential reason for leaving the country. The UK is an exception among most European countries by not having a withholding dividend tax.\n\nUnder the plan, Shell would still be listed in Amsterdam, London and New York but with a single line of shares, widening the pool to which the 25 per cent cap is applied and so allowing it to boost its buybacks.\n\nFT recalled that Rutte\u2019s coalition government promised in 2017, to scrap the 15 per cent withholding tax to make the country more business-friendly, and encouraged both Unilever and Shell to relocate entirely to the Netherlands.\n\nBut the proposal was shelved after sparking political uproar among green and left parties, which objected to the government offering tax favours to multinationals worth about \u20ac1.9 billion a year. Unilever subsequently announced last year it was moving its headquarters from Rotterdam to London.\n\nShell has faced other problems in the Netherlands this year. In May, a court in The Hague ordered the company to make bigger and faster cuts to its carbon emissions than it had planned, a ruling against which Shell is appealing. Then last month Dutch pension fund ABP said it was divesting from all fossil fuel companies, including a significant stake in Shell.\n\nThe energy group was also under fire from US activist hedge fund Third Point, which after having built a large stake is calling for a split of the company, which it accuses it of being bogged down by an incoherent strategy.\n\nShell shareholders are set to vote on the company\u2019s planned changes at a general meeting on December 10.\n\nA Reuters report stated Monday that Shell\u2019s chief executive announced that he was proposing to move the $170 billion oil giant\u2019s headquarters, its corporate tax residency and himself from the Netherlands to the UK.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s the recent Dutch court ruling obliging Shell to slash its annual emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. The company says it will do that regardless of where it\u2019s based.\n\n\u201cBut its own target only applies to the fraction of its 1.6 billion tonnes of annual emissions that come from its own operations, rather than those produced by its customers,\u201d it had reported.\n\nThe departure and loss of the Dutch \u201croyal\u201d label will win Shell few friends in its former home. But with the Dutch government in post-election limbo and a parliamentary proposal to tax departing conglomerates stalled, the downside at least for now seems limited, Reuters said.\n\nEarlier this year, Shell, which has been restructuring its operations in many parts of the world, also announced that it was selling off its onshore and shallow water assets in Nigeria, saying it could no longer cope with community issues in the Niger Delta.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nwith agency report",

          "text": "The World Bank has stated that the destruction caused by the Boko Haram sect caused economic activities in the north-eastern part of the country to decline by 50 per cent.\n\nThe multilateral institution noted that Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states which are in the Lake Chad region saw economic activities decline from 10 to 14 per cent between 2009 and 2013, adding that the region has recorded 50 per cent decline in activities from 2018.\n\nSpeaking at the Launch of the Lake Chad regional economic memorandum, Lead Economist, World Bank and Co-author of the report, Mr. Marco Hernandez said: \u201cIn northern Nigeria, we see that 50 per cent or more of crop yields have been affected as a result of conflict, there is a huge cost that could very well turns into a benefit because that takes into account other factors that have been going on at the time, including, for instance, issues related to climate.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the effects of Boko Haram alone, once again, you now isolate it from all the different things that are going on in the region, what we have seen is that there are two messages to highlight on the one hand, that economic activity has fallen and the large reduction in economic activity has become even more apparent with time.\n\n\u201cIt used to be 10 to 14 per cent of reduced economic activity when Boko Haram was just starting, but now closer to 2018 and so it has been closer to 50 per cent of economic activity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBoko Haram is not just on those places where insurgency happens, it also affects neighbouring parts for where the actual attack happens as well.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, for the region to grow, the bank called for enhanced trade, improved infrastructure to move people good and services, improved governance and management of natural resources.\n\nHe added: \u201cNow, when we take into account that security as an underlying precondition for developing the Lake Chad region, we focus on four key areas that we believe are essential to help break that cycle.\n\n\u201cThe first one is trade facilitation; the ability to move goods and services from one place to another; connected infrastructure specially to make it easier for those goods and services to move in and including labour as well.\n\n\u201cThe third area is governance and the importance that it has across all the different development challenges that Lake Chad region faces. And the fourth one is about natural resource management.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Country Director for Nigeria, World Bank, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri advised Nigeria to urgently tackle insecurity to enhance growth especially in the north-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think especially for an institution like the World Bank, you know we are for development and for that, we need peace and security to proceed with development.\u201d\n\nNume Ekeghe",
