          "title": "Media not friendly with bandits, terrorists, says NGE",
          "text": "The Nigerian Guild of Editors on Wednesday dismissed the statement by the National Broadcasting Commission that journalists were best friends of terrorists and bandits.\n\nThe organisation said since journalists have a responsibility to help the country cope with the prevailing threat and consequences of banditry, kidnapping and terrorism in Nigeria, they would continue to be responsible and responsive in their reports.\n\nThe NGE in a statement by its President, Mustapha Isah; and General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, titled, \u2018NGE: Media not disposed to giving terrorists exposure,\u2019 said it would never be disposed to giving the bloodthirsty criminals any exposure.\n\nThe NGE was responding to the recent directive by the NBC, which warned journalists, television and radio stations in Nigeria against \u201cglamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers,\u201d their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nThe NBC had in the directive cautioned broadcasters against glamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nHowever, the NGE described the directive as a subtle threat to free press, freedom of expression, access to information, and victims\u2019 right to justice, which were essential ingredients for public debate and accountability in a democratic space.\n\nThe organisation said given the consistent anti-media policy of the NBC in recent times, its members were concerned about what the agency meant by the expansive definitions of what may constitute \u201ctoo many details,\u201d \u201cglamorising,\u2019\u2019 \u201cdivisive rhetoric,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019security issues.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads partly, \u201cWe hope it is not a ploy by the NBC to ban newspapers review in broadcasting stations because the content of the directive doesn\u2019t specify what kind of conduct would fall within their realm. It is our view that the role of independent, critical, and trustworthy journalism has never been more important than now in our country.\u201d\n\nThe NGE stated that the Nigerian media were mindful of their responsibility in the current collective efforts to address the security challenges in the country.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cWe must also not lose ability to see that security, in a democratic nation, is not an end in itself.\n\n\u201cIts single purpose is to protect the capability of institutions, including the media, to guarantee citizens the free exercise of their fundamental human rights, without discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe NGE reiterated that there were no security without free media and free expression, and no free expression and free media without security, saying the two terms should come hand-in-hand and not fight each other in the general interest of the nation.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "NDDC is victim of prebendalism \u2013 Tony Osborg",
          "text": ".\n\nA foremost Federalist and a PhD Researcher at the University of Port Harcourt, Mr Tony Osborg, has described the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as a victim of prebendalism.\n\nSpeaking earlier this week on Monday the 19th of July 2021 with his co-researchers during a socio-political policy dialogue at the Department of Philosophy, University of Port Harcourt, Osborg described the NDDC as a victim of a patronage system which is an inevitable by-product of the bad unitary structure that we falsely call a federation in Nigeria.\n\nHe argued that \u201cfirst and foremost we need to understand that the problem we have in Nigeria is not necessarily that of leadership and or corruption. Our political structure is so faulty to the extent that it affects everything else, including the performance of good and visionary leaders.\n\n\u201cBring back Jonathan or retain President Buhari and their political parties for another ten years and I can assure you that the result will likely be the same because no matter how good a driver is if the car has a flat tyre or a bad engine, there will no motion for the car. This is the situation we have found ourselves in in Nigeria today. Sadly our leaders have failed to understand this critical point in our politics\u2019.\n\nHe went further \u201cIn my book published in 2015 titled \u2018Can Nigeria Bake Her Own Bread?\u2019 I argued that corruption was not Nigeria\u2019s biggest problem like our leaders have made us believe over the years. Corruption in Nigeria is a symptom of a bad structure. The system we operate needs corruption to survive.\n\n\u201cIf you eliminate corruption from our system, that is if you can, then the Nigerian political patronage system as we know it today will obviously collapse. Sadly, that will not happen because corruption and our political structure are in a symbiotic relationship. We all love and anticipate to benefit from corruption even though we are mostly publicly hypocritical about it.\u2019\n\nHe added \u201cin my Master\u2019s Degree research, I argued that Nigeria does not yet qualify to be called a country because it does not yet possess the basic elements that make a functional society. Aside from that, even in our so-called federal system, we also do not possess the minimum requirement of federalism so we should not be called a federation. That is a topic for another day.\n\n\u201cTake a look at the NDDC, I mean a real look at the structure of the commission. First, the Act says you must rotate the executive positions amongst the various states, that is a kind of zoning. Do Nigerians know that zoning is a form of corruption under the patron-clientelism arrangement? Let me explain, here in the academic world, there is a word called prebendalism, that word defines everything we know today as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWikipedia defines prebendalism as \u2018political systems in which elected officials and government workers feel they have a right to a share of government revenues, and use them to benefit their supporters, co-religionists and members of their ethnic group\u2019. So, as you can see prebendalism defines Nigeria\u2019s patronage system. Nigeria is prebendalism and prebendalism is Nigeria.\n\nHe went further \u201cthe only reason the Minister of the Niger Delta wants to retain full grip of the NDDC is simply to solely benefit from prebendalism. The rest of the Niger Delta leaders also scheming to make nominations into the NDDC board are all doing so for the same purpose of benefitting from prebendalism, even their concept of development is faulty because it is still tied to prebendalism.\n\n\u201cNDDC, just like every other federal institution of Nigeria is simply a victim of prebendalism. It is even worse at the state level, look at my home state of Delta. The Urhobos and Ijaws are scheming to take over from the Ika man not on the basis of competence or development vision of the aspirants but on the basis of \u2018na our turn\u2019. Turn to do what, to obviously benefit from prebendalism and continue with the neopatrimonialism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile the elites sell zoning as a form of justice and fairness to the populace, in reality, it is their own strategy to redistribute wealth amongst themselves using a rotational mechanism that seems fair to the public. Nigerians now believe that the fastest way of bringing development to their region or community is to have their own power.\n\n\u201cHow this aberration has become a national philosophy beats my imagination as a critical thinker. In our desperation to patronize prebendalism, we ignore merit and competence and this is exactly how we have arrived where we are today as a country with only growth but little development.\n\n\u201cLike Prof Claude Ake once said, Development is supposed to be a process of social transformation in which the people themselves are in charge of the process. You cannot sit in Abuja or Asaba and decide the development of my community, the people of that community must be part of the process and only then can they take ownership of their future by directing the process.\n\n\u201cSadly the unitary system we operate in Nigeria forbids that kind of peoples participation in governance and that is why what we have across the country is simply growth and not development. The people cannot control their security, economy, education, etc. Everything is dictated from the centre so everybody wants to send their people to that centre rather than question why the centre should dictate everything and not grant them autonomy to determine their future.\u201d\n\nTony Osborg who is also the Founder of Hometown Development Initiative (HDI), a think-tank organization founded in the year 2018 to proffer pragmatic solutions to social problems in Nigeria called on his fellow Philosophy PhD researchers to focus on addressing social issues with their theorization rather than theorizing on the abstract ideas of dead philosophers whose ideas have become redundant to the political realities of today.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "A foremost Federalist and a PhD Researcher at the University of Port Harcourt, Mr Tony Osborg, has described the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as a victim of prebendalism.\nOur political structure is so faulty to the extent that it affects everything else, including the performance of good and visionary leaders.\nThis is the situation we have found ourselves in in Nigeria today.\nNigeria is prebendalism and prebendalism is Nigeria.\n\u201cNDDC, just like every other federal institution of Nigeria is simply a victim of prebendalism.",

Let sleeping dog my dear DSS.\n\n\u201cI suggest giving a sound of warning through the Yoruba leaders of thought and their Royal fathers before carrying out an attack on someone who is representing the Yoruba race peacefully. God bless Federal Republic of Nigeria. God bless His Excellency.\n\n\u201cLet peace reign in Nigeria and stop using violence to correct your citizens\n\nWhatever reason behind this attack is not comely enough to result to manhandling of human beings this way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sent by God to give this piece of advice to avoid escalated crisis in the Country, especially in the South West.\n\nAdegboye, Gabriel Olabisi is my name\n\nThe Convener of Save Nigeria Network.\u201d\n\nSunday Igboho was reportedly arrested in Cotonou, Benin Republic on Monday night and the Federal Government of Nigeria has been battling to repatriate him back to the country.",

Mathew Hassan Kukah.\n\nHURIWA accused Shehu of having used his words carelessly in the rejoinder he issued against Kukah\u2019s presentation to the American Congress recently.\n\nThe rights group believes that Kukah\u2019s statement to the US congress Committee on Foreign Affairs needed not to have generated controversy if not that Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari has degenerated to a Banana Republic whereby the elected leaders have turned themselves into tyrants who are scared of the truth.\n\nIn his statement before the Congress, as DAILY POST reported, the cleric had, among other things, alleged that Christians were being targeted by insurgents and bandits and Buhari was showing preference for people of his religion and ethnic group in matters of appointments and in the enforcement of the relevant policies and legal framework against the rising insecurity.\n\nAngered by this, Garba Shehu, in a scathing response on behalf of the Presidency, described the cleric\u2019s allegations as false and lambasted the revered Bishop.\n\nShehu considered it \u201ctroubling when a so-called man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency also expressed disappointment that some citizens threw their weight behind Kukah following his comments.\n\nHowever, HURIWA, in its reaction through the National Coordinator Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf said that Shehu has only succeeded in celebrating his scanty understanding of the Constitution by making unintelligent and insensitive remarks.\n\nHURIWA has asked Shehu to do a short intensive programme on the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999 so he understands the fuller intents of the relevant sections that speak to the issues of Federal character principles.\n\nThe Rights group said the Federal character of Nigeria includes the fact that Nigeria is a country with two dominant religions of Christians and Moslems and others such as African traditional worshippers.\n\n\u201cWe totally endorse the presentation made by His Lordship the Bishop of the Catholic diocese of Sokoto for these are facts that are empirical and we are witnesses to the ongoing nepotistic appointments of President Muhammadu Buhari and the consistent killings of Christian clerics by Islamists are facts which the President can\u2019t hide from.\u201d",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nLeading lawyers, yesterday, swung into action to avert the repatriation of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemi popularly known as Sunday Igboho to Nigeria from Cotonou, Republic of Benin.\n\nThey claimed the way his house was raided by the Department of State Security (DSS) in collaboration with other security agencies in the early hours of June 1 showed he would not get justice if extradited to Nigeria.\n\nThey also said he had not committed any offence arguing that he was merely fighting for freedom for his people and self-determination which is recognised under the United Nations charter.\n\nLeader of the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), Emeritus Prof Banji Akintoye, also said frontline Yoruba patriots were working to provide assistance, saying, \u201cBenin Republic is a land that respect the rules of law.\u201d\n\nHe spoke amidst viral rumour that he had been released. It was even accompanied with a photograph aboard an aeroplane purportedly on his way to Germany, which his lawyer has denied\n\nThe activist was arrested alongside his wife, Ropo, a German citizen by men of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) while trying to board a flight to Germany Monday night.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer based in Texas, United States of America, Leesi Ebenezer Olarewaju, has ruled out the possibility of his repatriation.\n\nHe said: \u201cSunday Adeyemo can only be returned back to Nigeria if only he is found to have broken any law in Benin Republic. Sunday Igboho, as we know, did not break any law in Benin. He was arrested under false alarm raised by the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cWe are on top of the situation right now. We have successfully notified the British government on the dangers of letting Sunday Adeyemo be returned to Nigeria where his life is at risk. We believe that before the end of today (yesterday), Britain would have granted his request for asylum in good faith.\u201d\n\nCorroborating him, Igboho\u2019s lead counsel, Yomi Alliyu (SAN), said he cannot be extradited to Nigeria because of the extradition treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin.\n\nHe condemned the arrest which he described as impunity and called on the government of Germany, Benin Republic and the international community \u201cto rise up and curb the impunity of the Nigerian government by refusing any application for extradition of our Client who already has application before the International Criminal Court duly acknowledged.\u201d\n\nHis statement read: \u201cIt is a shocking news that Nigerian Government has gotten Chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho Oosa arrested by INTERPOL in Republic of Benin notwithstanding the political nature of his offence and what the DSS earlier said that they refrained from arresting him so as not to overheat the polity of Southwestern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\n\u201cNow, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries. This made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a political offender who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason.\n\n\u201cSecondly, that he cannot get Justice or even be killed is apparent in how those arrested in his house were detained for more than 21 days now without access to their lawyers. Even the wife among them could not change her undies for 21days! Which inhuman treatment can be more this?\n\n\u201cAgain, another wife of our client Mrs Ropo Adeyemo, a German Citizen, has been arrested together with her husband in Cotonou. What offence has she committed to warrant this?\n\n\u201cWe urge the good government of the Republic of Benin and international community, especially Germany, to rise up and curb the impunity of the Nigerian Government by refusing any application for extradition of our Client who already has application before ICC duly acknowledged.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Akintoye called on all Yoruba people within and beyond the shores of Nigeria to come out and ensure their ancestral land is not defeated by invaders.\n\n\u201cWhat the situation now calls for is that the Yoruba nation at home and in Diapora must stand strong, resolved that neither Sunday Igboho, nor any other Yoruba person will henceforth be subjected to inhuman or dehumanizing treatment of any kind.\n\n\u201cWe Yoruba nation are, by the grace of God, a very strong nation. We must arise now to show that strength. For a start, we must all see to it now that Sunday Ighoho will get his freedom back so as to be able to move and operate as a free person. We all know he has committed no crime.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people are trying to suppress or even eliminate him only because he stood up to defend his kinsmen, women and children who are being massively killed and raped in their ancestral home land; who are having their assets and means of livelihood destroyed, and who are facing ethnic cleansing and even genocide without having the benefit of protection by the rulers of their country.\n\n\u201cWe know, furthermore, that for the protection of his people who are being brutalized, he has joined hands with many of his brethren to take the legally-approriate step, namely to seek the intervention of the International Criminal Court.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG), in a statement by its chairman, Olawale Oshun and secretary, Ayo Afolabi, described Igboho as one of the leading activists against the unmitigated terror of herdsmen.\n\n\u2022Juju has failed, Joe Igbokwe taunts\n\nHowever, Joe Igbokwe, chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday mocked Igboho.\n\nIgbokwe sharing a photograph of Igboho wearing charms on his Facebook wall, taunted the Yoruba separatist leader\u2019s repeated bragging about his indomitability as an African traditional worshiper \u2013 often referred to as Juju \u2013 in separate instances where security forces tried to arrest him and he escaped.\n\nIgbokwe, who also taunted IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu after he was arrested and flown to Nigeria from Kenya, likened Igboho\u2019s arrest to the arrest of several IPOB members who also bragged about the potency of charms they wore as protection against police and soldiers attempting to arrest them.\n\nThe aide to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State wrote: \u201cJuju no de work again ooo.

          "text": "By Wale Ajimotokan\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has said that Nigerian journalists, especially its members, are not terrorists and bandits\u2019 best friends, against the wicked insinuation by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), and so, will never be disposed to giving the bloodthirsty criminals any exposure.\n\nThe Nigerian editors also stated that giving the fact that journalists have a responsibility to help the country cope with the prevailing threat and consequences of banditry, kidnapping and terrorism in Nigeria, they will continue to be responsible and responsive in their reports.\n\nThe professional group of all the editors in Nigeria stated this on Wednesday while expressing concern over the recent directive by the NBC, warning journalists, television and radio stations in Nigeria against \u201cglamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers\u201d during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nIn a directive, titled \u201cNewspaper Reviews And Current Affairs Programmes: A Need For Caution\u2019\u2019, signed by the Director, Broadcast Monitoring, Francisca Aiyetan, on behalf of the new Director-General of the Commission, Balarabe IIeah, the regulatory agency had cautioned broadcasters against glamorising and giving too many details on the nefarious activities of terrorists and kidnappers during their daily newspaper reviews.\n\nHowever, in a statement signed by the NGE\u2019s President, Mustapha Isah, and the General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, the group said that the directive is unhelpful, describing it as a subtle threat to free press, freedom of expression, access to information, and victims\u2019 right to justice, which are essential to public debate and accountability in a democratic space.\n\nThe Guild added that giving the consistent anti-media policy of NBC in recent times, its members are concerned about what the commission means by the expansive definitions of what may constitute \u2018\u2019too many details\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019glamorising\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019divisive rhetoric\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2019security issues\u2019\u2019 in its directive.\n\n\u2018\u2019We hope it is not a ploy by the NBC to ban newspapers review in broadcasting stations. Because, the content of the directive doesn\u2019t specify what kind of conduct would fall within their realm. It is our view that the role of independent, critical and trustworthy journalism has never been more important than now in our country,\u201d the Guild explained.\n\nThe Guild added that the Nigerian media are very mindful of their responsibility in the current collective efforts to address the security challenges in the country, adding that the relationship between the security agencies and the media has been more respectful and trustful along this mission in the past few years.\n\nNGE added: \u2018\u2019While we are mindful of our responsibility at this trying moment of our nation, we must also not lose ability to see that security, in a democratic nation, is not an end in itself.\n\n\u2018\u2019Its single purpose is to protect the capability of institutions, including the media, to guarantee citizens the free exercise of their fundamental human rights, without discrimination.\n\n\u2018\u2019History has revealed time and again that efforts to increase security through the clampdown of liberty and freedom have threatened both liberty and security.\u201d\n\nNGE reiterated that there is no security without free media and free expression, and no free expression and free media without security, saying these two terms should come hand in hand and not fight each other in the general interest of the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Hails Dairo\u2019s gallantry\n\nBandits wanted me alive, says officer\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said he was initially devastated by the news of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet, which was downed over the weekend by terrorist bandits in Zamfara State, but that the survival of the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, who successfully ejected from the aircraft after it came under \u201cintense ground fire\u201d later relieved him.\n\nWhile Buhari, however, hailed the pilot\u2019s gallantry in the face of intense fire power, Dairo too said his survival was only made possible by God because the bandits wanted him alive than killing him after they knew he had ejected.\n\nThe pilot had finished a raid against kidnappers, when he came under intense fire, the Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBut Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several strongholds of the bandits by using the cover of darkness and his phone set to navigate and maneuver his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\nReacting to the development in a statement issued last night by a presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, President Buhari said he was pained by the news of the air crash.\n\n\u201cI was shocked by the devastating news of the air crash but felt much relieved, following the successful ejection by the pilot and his eventual rescue. May the injured pilot recover at the earliest time,\u201d President Buhari was quoted as saying.\n\nShehu said President Buhari had been briefed on the successful operation by the nation\u2019s defence forces to rescue the pilot, few days after armed bandits gunned down the military aircraft.\n\nThe attack happened on the border of the northern Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, had immediately commended the pilot for his bravery.\n\nIrabor, who met the pilot in company with the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, before proceeding to a meeting with military veterans in the North-west, commended the pilot for the gallantry and bravery he demonstrated in the fight against banditry.\n\nHowever, giving a personal account of what happened, Dairo, who declared that God made his survival possible as he waded through the stronghold of armed bandits in the Zamfara bushes at night until his rescue, said the bandits, who operated more like Boko Haram, were interested in capturing him alive than shooting him with the way they combed the bushes in search of him.\n\nIn a testimony he gave to his high school group in a WhatsApp platform, he said he prayed from the moment his plane was shot and throughout the ordeal and God answered his supplications.\n\nHe told his colleagues on the social media platform that prior to the incident, he had dreams of fighting and evading enemies.\n\n\u201cBefore Sunday I had been having dreams, where I saw myself fighting and evading enemies like real-time war, day in day out, like nightmares, so when my jet got shot with the explosives and my flight controls were destroyed and I had no choice than to eject, I just said \u2018God, finally, here we go\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs I was flanked by the bandits, I kept praying and I kept telling God to answer your prayers, because I know you (his group) were all praying for me. I love you all and I thank God for bestowing his love on me and saving me from death several times within that period\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI will still share my testimonies but truly God ordered my steps, the bandits (meanwhile they are ruthless like Boko haram, I don\u2019t know why we still call them bandits) were more interested in capturing me than shooting me (even at point blank range), eventually they got neither.\n\n\u201cHe gave me the strength to run and walk covering almost 30kms even with one strained leg. Having not had any food or water all day, I prayed for strength, because I needed it, and he gave me\u201d.\n\nFurther, the gallant pilot said, \u201cI can spend hours talking of how I lost and regained hope multiple times throughout my adventure but God is faithful. It\u2019s now that I feel all the pains I suffered from the ejection (including a fracture in my neck and painful back and chest) but God didn\u2019t allow those pains to slow me down for the bandits to capture me.\n\n\u201cNAF platforms overhead also helped me to deter them a lot by making some of them to pin down while I kept running, and when they got close to me, I was still able to evade them by camouflaging (I was wearing green fg suits \u2013 in the green forest) and concealing myself\u201d, Dairo said, adding that he encountered many obstacles in the forest but survived with God\u2019s help.\n\n\u201cI ran into plenty spiders and I laid down several times out of weakness not knowing if anything poisonous would sting or bite me. All glory is to God, all glory. I have not been your most righteous brother, but I felt God\u2019s hands in everything, even in every decisions I took immediately I was shot, all the decisions worked together to save my life\u201d.\n\nHe narrated that that he was able to remove his phone from his lap to his protective suit before pulling the ejection handle.\n\n\u201cFor example, removing my phone from my lap and putting it in my G -suit before pulling the ejection handle (I had to use the compass of the phone and AirNav Pro application to navigate), and making the decision to turn hard 90 degrees immediately the bandits lost sight of me on a sandy cliff, where they couldn\u2019t trace my footpath again (the CAS told me they got information that in turn, the bandits kept going straight in the direction I was initially going and they destroyed several villages and camps, killing plenty people, thinking those people harbored me).\n\n\u201cSo much more\u2026 the village I eventually entered at night, I told God that the first person I see and call should favour me and that happened, he gave me clothes, pain-relieving drugs, food and water and even malt, and he organised for a bike to carry me to Dansadau early next morning (throughout the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, I was praying that the bandits don\u2019t attack the village because my right leg was already swollen and very painful so I couldn\u2019t jump fences or run again, plus I didn\u2019t want to bring death upon innocent people, and it may force the guy to give me out to the bandits\u201d, he narrated.\n\nThe pilot said his helpers dropped him where he was picked up by soldiers.\n\n\u201cThey dropped me with the person, who with pride and joy called the army guys to come and meet me (they all had sleepless nights). NAF helicopters came to pick me up from there. There are so much to say. All thanks to God, thank you so much\u201d, he said.\n\nSpokesman of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed the pilot\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s from the pilot. He sent it to his high school WhatsApp chat group\u201d, he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down.

Image credit: AP via NZHerald\n\nOnly Cell C\u2019s facilities had not experienced significant damage from the unrest as of Friday, according to its chief operations officer Andre Ittman.\n\nJust one of its network towers was vandalised within the Durban area but it did not affect service delivery to consumers.\n\nAccording to Ittman, there are six other sites available within a two-kilometre radius of the damaged site, which helped to absorb the coverage provided to ensure customers stayed connected.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe ongoing unrest in South Africa, said to be the worst since the end of the apartheid regime 27 years ago, was sparked by the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nLast month, the ex-leader was sentenced to 15 months jail time for defying an order to provide evidence at a judicial inquiry set up to probe high-level corruption during his nine-year tenure (from 2009 \u2013 2018).\n\nProtests swiftly degenerated into violent marches and looting. Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Google\u2019s interest in Africa\u2019s tech talent pool deepens, the tech giant has partnered with Nigerian-founded game development studio, Maliyo Games, to open applications for a mobile game developer training program. Called GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, the program is available to interested individuals in Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\nThe applications, which opened on Monday, July 19, 2021 \u2014 and closes by August 2 \u2014 will offer developers planning to build a career in game development access to mentorship and relevant tools. Selected applicants will go through a virtual training program from August 16 to December 23, 2021, where they will learn to refine, package, and develop Android games.\n\nBeing a project-based learning program, by the end of the training period, successful participants will be evaluated based on the completion of the curriculum and ability to publish a game on the Google Play Store successfully.\n\nParticipants will pass through three levels of training, themed: Game Development Fundamentals, Succeed on the Play Store, and Publish Your First Game. The successful completion of one level validates moving to the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEligibility\n\nIntending applicants must:\n\nReside in Nigeria, Ghana, or Kenya\n\nHave a basic background in programming languages like C#, C++, and PHP.\n\nOwn a PC.\n\nBe available to commence Bootcamp by August 16, 2021\n\nNote: Selected participants will be judged based on three metrics: competence, commitment, and creativity.\n\nApplication process\n\nApplicants will pass through two stages before final shortlisting.\n\nStage one: Fill the online application form on the company website.\n\nStage two: After scaling the first stage, shortlisted candidates will have to undergo a C# (a core language for game developers) assessment to demonstrate their competence in the programming language. The assessment is scheduled to hold on August 9, 2021.\n\nNote: The organisers will provide data allowance for selected developers during the training.\n\nAbout GameUpAfrica Bootcamp\n\nThe GameUpAfrica Bootcamp is an adaptation of an existing training project by Maliyo Games, which was instituted in 2020. It is a curriculum-based training program that prospective hires must go through before they are accepted into the company.\n\nBetween 2020 and now, the company has trained seven people and absorbed one into the company. Interestingly, the program was born out of the need to solve the problem of talent acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually launched this program because, as a game development studio, we are constantly looking for talented individuals to join our team. And because of a lack of structured education system that produces competent game developers in Nigeria, we made the decision last year to launch an in-house program that will enable us to train individuals who are interested in becoming game developers.\u201d That\u2019s Hugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games. Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2012, the company has grown to become one of Nigeria\u2019s longest-standing Android game development studios. According to the founder, this is one of the qualities that attracted Google to the project, aside from the fact that Maliyo Games has published some Africa-themed games on the Google Play Store.\n\nNotable mentions include Aboki Run (similar to Temple Run), Whot King, and Jungle escape. Others like Danfo Racing are still in development.\n\nEven though the company\u2019s initial intention for the curriculum is limited to the Nigerian market, Google\u2019s partnership increased the scope to reach multiple locations, thereby raising the number of selected applicants to 500. In addition to that, Google will also provide support for app store success, which includes successful publishing of content on Google Play Store.\n\nAnother way this program will help beginner game developers is by providing them with a pool of mentors. Going by the number of admitted candidates, mentorship will not only come from Maliyo Games team, but the company will also crowdsource mentors from the international gaming ecosystem.\n\nExperienced mentors can volunteer through this link.\n\nMaliyo Games\u2019 fit\n\nAs is typical of content from many indigenous companies, Maliyo Games studio ensures that its content reflects the African scene.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t do the generic stuff, like working for third parties and designing based on their requirements or being part of a production team where we only look after one aspect of e development. For us, it has always been about African-inspired. And this is what stands us out in the gaming community,\u201d the founder explains.\n\nFor Obi, the ultimate goal of the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp \u2014 which could become a yearly affair \u2014 is to upskill people and have more game developers in the African gaming ecosystem. In addition to that, to increase the number of African-published content on the Google Play Store, and help to identify and attract talents into the company as it plans to grow its team.\n\nIn achieving the former, Obi reveals that top candidates from the Bootcamp will be linked with other studios across the continent. Already, there are existing internal partnerships with studios in Kenya, Ghana, and Senegal.\n\nAside from that, Maliyo Games is part of the Africa Game Developer Community, where it networks with gaming studios in South Africa, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. Eventually, Obi believes that the Bootcamp will become a talent pipeline for these studios.\n\nMeanwhile, game studios looking to hire developers through the program can show their interest here.\n\nAfrica\u2019s gaming industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth of the African gaming industry has been gaining momentum for the past three years with growing broadband and smartphone penetration. In fact, prospects are increasing despite the pandemic.\n\nObi likens games to music and movies, not only as a form of escape, but also entertainment which is universally accepted without discrimination of the source.\n\nHe identifies three major challenges that may have stalled the growth of the country\u2019s gaming industry in the past decade: talent, distribution, and monetisation.\n\nIn his opinion, in the past 9 years of running Maliyo Games, opportunities that exist now are thinning out the effects of these challenges. For instance, global distribution channels now exist \u2014 the likes of app stores \u2014 supporting reach and marketing, and payment solutions abound.\n\nWith this, creators can focus on developing and releasing content. If anything, local content are assured of global consumption. Obi\u2019s dream is that by the end of 2022, a product of the Bootcamp would become a highly grossed game on the Google Play Store.\n\nWith projects like this, Africa\u2019s gaming community is, perhaps, on its way to becoming a major contributor to the over $121.1 billion global mobile gaming industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Well, its website is live now. Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, revealed this in a tweet yesterday.\n\nWhat\u2019s the fuss about? Since the 90s, when the first tech companies were founded, Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem has progressed. Since then, we\u2019ve seen Paystack get acquired, Interswitch and Flutterwave become unicorns, and Jumia get listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are supposed to be exciting times, but it appears government policies are making it difficult for entrepreneurs and investors to remain excited. This year alone, the transacting of cryptocurrency through banks has been regulated, while Twitter has been temporarily banned in the country.\n\nEvents like this have made it important for founders to interact with the government, hence, the Startup Bill. At the time of the first report, it was revealed that a first draft of the bill would be ready by August 2021.\n\nWith the website launching only 11 days to the end of July, it could be that plans are on track.\n\nAccording to a Medium post on the website, the first draft of the bill would be reviewed by ecosystem leaders and representatives in July, while town halls would be held in August 2021. A final draft would be produced in September 2021 and submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari in October 2021.\n\nCause for optimism? Should plans for the bill go as planned, it could unlock a lot of value for Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. For one, investors are assured that sudden government policies would not destroy their investments. More capital being injected into the tech ecosystem would also mean more jobs, and who can complain about that?\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ll keep you informed of any new developments.\n\nKenyans to pay VAT for using Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>Photo Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-mbabazi-001a331a/\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d rel=\u201dnoopener\u201d>Morgan Mbabazi</a> (National Media Group).</em>\n\nStarting August 2021, Kenyans will begin paying Value Added Tax (VAT) for using video conferencing platform, Zoom. The company joins the ranks of YouTube and Facebook as Internet platforms charging VAT in the country.\n\nWho is this for? Not everyone. Customers will be issued a VAT invoice showing the tax at the appropriate rate if they are not registered for VAT in Kenya. For registered VAT customers, they must provide Zoom with their Personal Identification Number (PIN) and a declaration that they are registered for VAT in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a customer\u2019s \u2018sold to\u2019 location indicates Kenya, but they have not provided a valid PIN and the required declaration, Zoom will charge Kenyan VAT on the invoice.\n\nThis development is not surprising. To increase revenue, the Kenyan government has revealed plans to tax companies that generate profit from the country.\n\nChanging times. Across the world, attempts by governments to tax digital businesses have increased. However, it is not straightforward as they operate models that are not catered to by most taxation laws.\n\nAs we revealed in a previous article, the existing agreement under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stipulates that companies pay taxes where their goods/services are produced instead of where they are consumed.\n\nThat has not stopped governments from trying, and the Kenyan government has led the way on the African continent. These are still early days, but it seems companies are getting on board quickly, and it might be a matter of time before other African countries follow suit.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nZimbabwe to include VASPs as securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@ewankennedy19?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Ewan Kennedy</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-trading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has revealed its intention to widen the definition of securities to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n\nVASPs refer to entities that facilitate the transaction, safekeeping, and administration of digital currencies. Consequently, cryptocurrency exchanges in Zimbabwe would now be regulated under the amended Securities and Exchange Act.\n\nThis move, which is the first time digital assets are mentioned under Zimbabwean law, suggests that the government is open to cryptocurrencies as stores of value and could facilitate their adoption in the South African country.\n\nBecause of attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies by governments, a common debate has been that of their status as securities. Classifying them as securities would mean that governments would regulate their usage, something that proponents say goes against the nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBy the way, seeing you love reading our newsletter this much, invite your friends and family to join you.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dominance of Nigeria\u2019s palm oil industry during the 1960s is often repeated when tales of the country\u2019s glory days are told. In the years following independence, Nigeria was the world\u2019s largest palm oil producer with a whopping 43% market share.\n\nThe story is different today as the country is the fifth-largest palm oil producer, but with only 2% of world production, it is far from a major player in the industry.\n\nAccording to Bernard Okata, a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, the annual demand for oil palm in Nigeria stands at 3 million metric tonnes. However, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, the country only produces 1.02 million metric tonnes.\n\nSuch a considerable gap means that Nigeria has to supplement local demand using imports. And as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, revealed, the country spends about $500 million annually to meet this demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious reports suggest that a lack of funding is responsible for Nigeria\u2019s loss of dominance in the oil palm industry, but that may not be entirely true. In 1965, several countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America received nearly $2 billion from the World Bank for the oil palm industry.\n\nNigeria was the second-highest recipient of this funding with $451.5 million. Furthermore, between 1975 and 2009, it was the second-largest recipient of funding from the World Bank. Therefore, it seems funding was not the major reason for the drop in production.\n\nIt is in this market that agritech startup, Releaf, is looking to make its mark. Founded in 2017 by Ikenna Nzewi (Co-founder and CEO), Isaiah Udotong (Co-founder and Chief Growth Officer), and Uzoma Ayogu (Co-founder and CTO), the startup briefly functioned as a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities.\n\nWhile doing this, the founders realised that food factories could not get enough high-quality raw materials to operate their factories at maximum capacity. They typically have fixed production costs, and the inability to run at optimal levels would mean they pass these costs down to the final consumer.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from leading with solutions, the founders set about understanding the market before making a move. They spent some time interacting with farmers and understanding how the market works. Armed with this knowledge, they changed their focus from a marketplace to an agro-processor producing palm kernel oil (PKO).\n\nPKO \u2014 extracted from the palm seed or kernel \u2014 is often used in food processing industries and cosmetics manufacturing. And according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), it is responsible for about 45% of the fat intake in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, getting quality PKO is difficult, and most factories depend on smallholder farmers responsible for about 80% of the industry\u2019s output. Others rely on importation to meet their needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith little financial assistance, these farmers have to crack the kernels manually, wasting precious person-hours that could be spent producing palm oil.\n\nThis is where Releaf plays. They buy the palm nuts and process them into PKO \u2014 using Kraken, a machine they created \u2014 before selling to factories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nEmployers of labour in Nigeria often complain about the unemployability of Nigerian youth. Still, Nzewi reveals that while it was a bit difficult, they got capable hands who assisted in the development of Kraken.\n\nIt also helped that Ayogu has a mechanical engineering degree from Duke University and previously worked at General Electric.\n\nEmpowering smallholder farmers\n\nSmallholder farmers currently drive the startup\u2019s supply, and Nzewi reveals that they are trying to reorient their mindset from what he calls a margin mentality to a volume mentality.\n\n\u201cA margin mentality is, \u2018okay, I have one ton of these palm kernels, how can I make 10,000 profit off it?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to make as much profit off whatever I have. That\u2019s the mentality I have. A volume mentality is, \u2018how can I work with the partners so I can produce 10 tons of this a week instead of the one tonne I\u2019m currently doing?'\u201d\n\nThis is done through various means, including financing and educating the farmers. With more money and knowledge of agricultural best practices, they can improve their production capacity.\n\nNzewi reveals that there are farmers in their network whose incomes have increased 5x since they started working with them.\n\nIn June 2021, the startup revealed a partnership with OnePipe to enable farmers to access digital financial services. The startup says that over 60% of the beneficiaries are women, with a 100% repayment rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm kernel mill. Image source: Supplied\n\nThis is significant because women constitute 75% of the workforce in the agricultural sector but do not earn enough and can often lose their land when their husbands or male relatives die.\n\nIt is common for agritech startups that work with smallholder farmers to have an extensive network of farmers, but this is not the route Releaf has chosen. Instead, they are focused on increasing the production capacities of the 3,000 farmers in their network.\n\nAccording to Nzewi, \u201cYou might not see that we have 100,000 farmers that we\u2019re working with in the first year, but you will see that many of our farmers are tripling, quadrupling or 5xing their income, and that\u2019s where our focus is. We\u2019re focusing on rural industrialisation, and we understand that takes concerted effort rather than just giving everyone a t-shirt or giving everyone a form to fill or something.\u201d\n\nDecentralising food production\n\nMost food factories in Nigeria are located in big cities such as Lagos, Kaduna, and Ibadan, but Releaf has taken a different approach.\n\nTheir factory is located in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. As it turns out, the South-South of Nigeria is responsible for 42% of Nigeria\u2019s palm oil production.\n\nOn what the startup\u2019s vision for food processing in Africa is, Nzewi says, \u201cMany people have tried to take Western models and fit them into Nigeria because they see a country with many people. The same thing has been done to the food processing industry, so most food processing factories are set up in big cities like Ibadan, Kaduna, or Lagos.\n\n\u201cThey are big factories with large capacity, but when you go into those factories, you will see that they are using about 30% of the capacity, and that is generally driven by the fact that they cannot get access to high-quality raw material.\u201d\n\nNzewi points out that while food factories in the West often have the luxury of sourcing raw materials from large farms, the same method can\u2019t be applied in Africa. By building factories in these big cities, they have to source their raw materials from distant farmers, which increases their production costs.\n\nConsequently, they can\u2019t pay farmers well. However, by locating factories close to these farmers, Releaf can help them increase their productivity and pay them more than the bigger factories.\n\nPalm trees grow in other parts of Africa, and Nzewi revealed expansion plans in the works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just trying to colour the African map with a presence in different countries, but we\u2019re more focused on deep impact. That\u2019s why I talk about things like the volume mentality and increasing the income of one of our smallholders 5x because that\u2019s the type of impact you should expect to see with Releaf,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm trees.

The startup reveals that it can produce 500 tonnes of PKO every week. In addition, Kraken can crack palm kernel nuts with a 95% efficiency, ensuring little wastage.\n\nWith smallholder farmers as their major competitors, its network of 3,000 farmers supplying them with the necessary raw materials gives Releaf a huge advantage.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nHaving created their proprietary technology, I was curious to know if that could change the startup\u2019s focus, but that does not seem to be the case. Releaf plans to build a network of decentralised factories powered by its technology close to farming hotspots on the continent.\n\nHowever, they revealed a willingness to adjust their approach as long as it ties in with their overarching mission to empower farmers and factories.\n\nSixty per cent of the world\u2019s uncultivated land lies in Africa, and experts believe that with the aid of technology and adequate help from research institutions, the continent can feed the world.\n\nWith the help of Kraken, Releaf is gunning for a portion of the global $61 billion palm oil market.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Short-term borrowing costs for banks still rising",
          "text": "The costs of short-term borrowing among Nigerian banks have risen sharply in the interbank market this year following the liquidity management strategies of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nInterbank borrowing costs were close to half a percent at the beginning of the year and are currently around 12 percent, according to Guy Czartoryski of Coronation Research.\n\nThe cost of borrowing is the price you pay for taking a loan, and this can come in the form of Overnight (O/N) rate or Open Buy Back (OBB) rate.\n\nThe Overnight (O/N) rate increased by 6.75 basis points to close at 11.50 percent on Monday as against the last close of 4.75 percent on Friday last week, a report by FSDH Research indicated.\n\nRead Also: CBN issues guidelines for banks borrowing from its window\n\nSimilarly, the Open Buy Back (OBB) rate increased by 6.50 percent to close at 11 percent on Monday compared to 4.50 percent on Friday.\n\nCash Reserve Requirement (CRR) is one of the tools used by the CBN in managing liquidity. The CBN has been controlling banking system liquidity this year by tightening the CRR.\n\nOn January 27, 2020, the CBN raised the CRR by 500 basis points to 27.5 percent from 22.5 percent previously, following high inflation rate and surging liquidity in the banking system.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, governor of the CBN, then assured of CBN confidence that the raised CRR would not in any way impede lending but would rather help strengthen growth.\n\nAs of July 2020, the CBN debited banks about N2.2 trillion for breaching its CRR requirements. One of the implications of CRR debit, according to FBNQuest, is pressure on banks liquidity ratios as well as an uptick in funding cost of banks, especially the smaller tier 2 banks.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Ope Ani and Czartoryski of Coronation Research, they noted that the inflection came last December when the CBN attached a small interest rate to its Special Bills of half a percent.\n\nThis, they said, signalled that it was putting floor under interest rates. \u201cThen, in early 2021, it flexed the CRR in such a way as to make liquidity just a little more scarce than it had been before. As we saw interbank rates, as well as Nigerian Treasury Bill rates, rose consistently from January through to June,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Special Bills were issued because the Cash Reserve Requirement was imposing liquidity constraints on banks.\n\nAni and Czartoryski said the Special Bills helped boost banks\u2019 liquidity ratios. However, they put downward pressure on some banks\u2019 Net Interest Margins as their interest-earning assets ballooned with the addition of the bills to their balance sheets, while they attracted an interest rate of just 0.5 percent. And then, the CBN\u2019s actions last December were a prelude to enabling market interest rates to climb quite quickly in the first half of this year.\n\nEmefiele noted at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting that the liquidity condition in the banking system in the review period was determined by several factors including \u2013 fiscal disbursements and withdrawals by states and local governments, periodic CRR debits, foreign exchange interventions, Open Market Operations, and maturing CBN bills, the net effect of which imposed liquidity constraints on the banking system.\n\nThe MPC noted that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above their prudential limits at 15.8 and 38.9 percent, respectively. The Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) at 5.89 percent in April 2021, showed progressive improvement compared with 6.6 percent in April 2020. The MPC, however, urged the bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to further reduce the level of NPLs in the industry.\n\nThe committee further recognised that the strategies put in place to rein in inflation through the use of a series of administrative measures by the bank to control money supply through liquidity mop up in the banking industry had started to yield results.",

          "title": "Netflix turns to games as streaming growth slows",
          "text": "Netflix is facing a formidable challenge as it expands into video games to keep the attention of customers in the increasingly competitive world of streaming television.\n\nThe streaming television leader offered details of its plans to move into games in its latest update confirming cooling growth even as the Silicon Valley giant spins off hit shows.\n\nAnalysts said the Netflix move is not aimed at disrupting the expanding gaming market but keeping its own viewers interested by offering new kinds of content.\n\n\u201cEntertainment and tech brands are adding gaming because it is adjacent to their video products, which makes gaming a somewhat natural extension of what they already do,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Ross Benes.\n\n\u201cAdding gaming allows them to suck up more of people\u2019s time and become further embedded within their customers\u2019 daily habits.\u201d\n\nBenes reasoned that Netflix games will give people impetus to stick with the service but are unlikely to significantly boost subscriptions.\n\nLoup Ventures manager partner Gene Munster called Netflix\u2019s action a \u201csmart move to retain and inch up paid subscriptions\u201d noting there are some two billion gamers worldwide.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter on Wednesday expected the Netflix move to have \u201czero\u201d impact on the game world.\n\n\u201cWe view the foray into games as an acknowledgement by management that the video content pipeline is flowing more slowly, with content costs continually on the rise,\u201d Pachter said in a note to investors.\n\n\u201cWe also view games as a \u2018shiny new object\u2019 that might distract investors from what we perceive to be Netflix\u2019s slowing growth.\u201d\n\nChief product officer Greg Peters said during an earnings call that getting into video games will be a multiyear effort with Netflix starting small in the mobile games arena.\n\n\u201cWe really see this as an extension of the core entertainment offering that we\u2019ve been focused on for the last 20 years,\u201d Peters said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try a bunch of different games through a variety of different mechanisms to see what\u2019s really working for our members.\u201d\n\nNetflix executives said they would play to the strengths of shows to create interactive fantasy worlds for fans, and that they are talking with video game makers about licensing deals.\n\n\u2013 Game gauntlet \u2013\n\nNetflix said games will be included in members\u2019 Netflix subscription at no additional cost, augmenting shows and films.\n\nNetflix has dabbled with games before, releasing an interactive \u201cBandersnatch\u201d episode of original series \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d and also a free mobile game spinning off its hit show \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will attract few gamers, if any, and don\u2019t have compelling (intellectual property) that will allow them to create compelling games,\u201d Pachter said in the note.\n\n\u201cThe business graveyard is littered with the corpses of content companies that have failed at making mobile games, with Disney the most prominent failure.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven video game industry veterans have missed the mark with mobile games.\n\nHit games spinning off of television shows are rarities, as are winning titles based on films, raising the question of why Netflix believes it can succeed where those with more experience have failed.\n\n\u201cThe marriage of Hollywood video production and games based on that content has faced a troubled history,\u201d said Third Bridge senior analyst Joe McCormack, noting that both Disney and NBCUniversal have shuttered video game units.\n\n\u201cWhether Netflix can change the script seems primarily driven by cultural differences between those Hollywood and video gaming studios.\u201d\n\nCompetition in the mobile game industry is intense. If Netflix wants to field more sophisticated games, it faces technological hurdles.\n\nConsole quality games streamed from the cloud require high-speed internet connections to avoid lag and controllers players can use to command action.\n\nAnd in that arena, Netflix would be up against cloud game services run by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Sony.\n\n\u201cThis is complex stuff, and we think that while Netflix has vast plans for succeeding in games, it has started its efforts with half-vast ideas,\u201d Pachter said of cloud gaming.\n\nNetflix\u2019s push into video games plays to its strengths of storytelling and content creation, and is intended to help the core subscription service grow, according to executives.\n\n\u201cWe are in the business of making these amazing worlds and great storylines and incredible characters,\u201d Peters said.\n\n\u201cAnd we know the fans of those stories want to go deeper; they want to engage further.\u201d\n\nFrance 24 is Premium Times syndication partner.

          "text": "Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Abiodun Ige Adams, has condemned in strong terms, the arrest on Monday of Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho in Cotonou, Republic of Benin.\n\nReacting in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, Iba Adams urged the Federal Government not to trivialise issues of agitations, saying the call for a Yoruba nation came to the front burner in Nigeria\u2019s political history because of growing injustice, nepotism, corruption and maladministration in the various sectors of the country.\n\nAare Adams, while picking holes in the manner by which the Federal Government had treated Igboho\n\nin recent time, expressed sadness over the way the FG had trampled upon the rights of the Yoruba nation activist, declaring that government must be fair in handling his case and that of other agitators.\n\nWondering how the Federal Government has decided to dissipate so much energy in clamping down on agitators of self determination,Iba Adams however, maintained that the country would have been alot more better for the mass of the people if such energy had been used in dealing with the various problems bedevilling the country in all areas, including economic, political and social challenges as well as the rising spate of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI feel bad when the news of his arrest broke out on Monday evening and I started monitoring unfolding events. But I think the FG should be fair to the young man because any attempt to trivialize issues of agitations might set this nation on fire. For example, the issue of self determination didn\u2019t come up overnight. It was as a result of the long years of injustice, nepotism, and corruption occasioned by bad leadership. So, the FG will be making a big mistake if it decides to treat agitators of Yoruba nation as common criminals or enemies.\n\n\u201cIgboho has a right to his freedom. There is nothing bad for him to seek assylum in Republic of Benin, and he is entitled to seek refuge in a foreign land if he thinks his safety cannot be guaranteed here in Nigeria. He is still a freedom fighter, and had never been violent in the struggle.So, FG must must stop hunting him around like a common criminal. He deserves his liberty under the law, that is why the Federal Government must handle his case with alot of care. Besides, the Government of the Republic of Benin has a duty to also protect him under the law,\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution the host country should not release the fugitive, \u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries were signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries.This made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a political offender who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason.\u201d\n\nIgboho\u2019s case is gradually exposing FG\u2019s plan to clamp down on all agitators and that is undemocratic,\n\nand also capable of turning govt to tyranny of the majority, especially,\n\nfrom a government that came to power with a lot of hope and support from the people of the South-West\u201d\n\n\u201cRight to Self Determination is also enthrenched in Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on People\u2019s Right\u201d\n\nIba Adams, however, urged the Federal Government to work out a well defined and articulate modality to accommodate the views of other well-meaning Nigerians, saying the forlorn that came with the issues of electronic transmission of election results had exposed the National Assembly that federal lawmakers are not in tune with the realities of the global community.\n\n\u201cDemocracy thrives when there is a free and fair election. In other climes, transparency is an integral part of election process. But here in Nigeria, it is a different ball game because we usually shy away from the reality of the present situation in the world. However, we cannot continue to live as if we are in the dark ages when there was no access to information, when there was no communication facilities like mobile phones and other facilities.This is 21st century, and it is an information age where countries of the world live and thrive on information. Therefore, it is sad to know that our lawmakers, who daily use mobile phones, operate mobile banking system with various network services, are now giving unnecessary excuses on the use of electronic transmission of election results. It is sad\u201d.",

          "text": "There are concerns over the arrest of popular Yoruba activist, Mr. Sunday Igboho at an airport in Cotonou, Benin Republic Monday night while attempting to flee to Germany.\n\nIgboho was declared wanted early July by the Department of State Services (DSS) following a raid carried out on his Soka residence in Oyo state.\n\nThe raid was based on intelligence reports received by the DSS on alleged stockpiling of arms.\n\nThe secret police directed Igboho to turn himself in or risk arrest.\n\nIn a bloody gun duel during the raid, two guards died while others sustained several degrees of injuries on both sides.\n\nSome 12 individuals were also whisked away from the house to Abuja by the DSS.\n\nThe Cotonou arrest\n\nBut with his arrest, prominent Yoruba leaders and Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-cultural group, have cautioned the federal government on the handling of the situation.\n\nIgboho, Blueprint gathered from multiple sources, Tuesday, was in possession of a Benin Republic passport at the time of his arrest.\n\nThe operation, it was further learnt, was said to have been carried out by DSS operatives in collaboration with Interpol.\n\nA source said: \u201cIt would have been difficult for authorities to arrest him outside the country. He had a German passport with 10-year validity. Forget the insinuations and reports that his location was tracked in Nigeria, it was difficult for intelligence sources to track his location; he has been in an undisclosed location in Benin Republic since about two weeks.\u201d\n\nCounsel speaks\n\nAnd in quick reaction to the arrest, Igboho\u2019s counsel, Yomi Aliyu (SAN), asked the government of Republic of Benin to refuse any application for his client\u2019s extradition by the Nigerian government.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, Tuesday, Aliyu said granting such extradition application would amount to flouting the extradition Treaty of 1984 among the quartet of Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin.\n\nHe claimed Igboho, who presently has a duly acknowledged application before the International Criminal Court (ICC), narrowly escaped death when DSS invaded his residence in Ibadan, shooting sporadically in search of him and killing at least two people with many, including one of his wives, arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution, the host country should not release the fugitive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories, made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries.\n\n\u201cThis made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a POLITICAL OFFENDER who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason. Secondly, that he cannot get justice or even be killed is apparent in how those arrested in his house were detained for more than 21days now without access to their lawyers. Even the wife among them could not change her undies for 21 days! Which inhuman treatment can be more than this?\u201d the silk queried.\n\nHe further said: \u201cIt is a shocking news that Nigerian Government has gotten Chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho Oosa arrested by INTERPOL in Republic of Benin notwithstanding the political nature of his offence and what the DSS earlier said that they refrained from arresting him so as not to overheat the polity of Southwestern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is advisable for the INTERPOL and Benin Republic to be aware of the savagery acts committed in our client\u2019s house in the wee hours of 1st July, 2021 between 1.00am and 3.00am; shooting their way through and killing 2 people in the process and maliciously damaging his properties in the course of that illegal invasion.\u201d\n\nYoruba group backs move\n\nAlso, a prominent Yoruba scholar, Banji Akintoye, has confirmed Igboho\u2019s arrest, saying Yoruba leaders were \u201ccurrently working to provide assistance to prevent his extradition from Benin Republic.\u201d\n\nAkintoye, leader of \u2018Ilana Omo Oodua\u2019 and a prominent campaigner for Yoruba self-determination, said in a statement Tuesday that Igboho committed no crime.\n\nThe emeritus professor who said \u201cleading lawyers in Benin Republic are now in charge,\u201d also added that \u201cfor a start, we must all see to it now that Sunday Ighoho will get his freedom back so as to be able to move and operate as a free person.\n\n\u201cWe have secured the services of a leading and highly respected lawyer whom we can confidently rely on. We know, furthermore, that for the protection of his people who are being brutalized, he has joined hands with many of his brethren to take the legally-appropriate step, namely to seek the intervention of the International Criminal Court.\u201d\n\nWe\u2018re studying situation \u2013 Afenifere\n\nAnd when contacted, the spokesman ofAfenifere, Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cThe news of the arrest was a surprise. But the body is still studying the situation before making a formal statement as details of the arrest is still sketchy.\u201d\n\nHe, however, added that \u201csecurity agencies appear to be more active in hunting those who are peacefully agitating for the rights and better deals for their people than they appear to be in dealing with bandits and terrorists who have deprived thousands of innocent Nigerians of their lives and properties.\n\n\u201cIf half of the energy deployed to apprehend Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho had been deployed to the menace of terrorists and bandits who kill, rape, rob and kidnap people, we would not have been in the unfortunate security mess that we are presently.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that government will direct more attention to addressing issues that gave birth to ethnic agitations. The earlier this is done the better.\u201d\n\nLadoja cautions\n\nAlso sounding some caution, the Osi Olubadan and former governor of Oyo state, High Chief Rashidi Ladoja asked the federal government to handle the issue of Igboho\u2019s arrest with utmost caution.\n\nLadoja stated this in Ibadan Tuesday while speaking to journalists at his Bodija residents after observing his Eid-el-Kabir prayers at the University of Ibadan praying ground.\n\nHe said rather than treating Igboho as a criminal, the government should consider giving him amnesty as a citizen of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is not the arrest that is important to me. It is the federal government that created Sunday Igboho. It is the federal government that created him. It was in respect of killings in Igangan and other areas. When the perpetrators are arrested, they will claim that they have power from above and they will release them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf Sunday Igboho is arrested today and the attitude did not change, many Sunday Igboho will surface. It has never been bad like this. It is unfortunate that the President is turning deaf ears. Just like Kanu has become a leader to some people, Sunday Igboho is also a leader to some people,\u201d the former governor added.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani herdsmen have killed many people, Dr. Fatai Aborode, Alhaji Sherifat Adisa were killed, nobody was arrested. That is why Sunday Igboho resorted into self help. It was because of these that Sunday Igboho came and became a hero.\n\n\u201cIf the situation is not well managed, many Kanu, Igboho will surface. They should give them amnesty just like the way they are giving Boko Haram,\u201d he said.\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his deep attachment to the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and impact so far, saying it had broadened the horizon of citizens, opened up opportunities and enhanced understanding of cultural differences.\n\nHe spoke when he received in audience corps members serving in his Daura country home in Katsina state, who paid him Sallah homage.\n\nThe president said he had consistently commended former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon for the initiative, which Buhari said had created more opportunities for uniting the country.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the youth corps members to make the most of the opportunity of travelling around the country, especially in understanding different climates, cultures, languages and views on life.\n\n\u201cEvery time I meet with former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, like recently, I still commend him for the initiative of the NYSC. The NYSC is spectacular in many ways.\n\n\u201cSome of you have come from Port Harcourt, Lagos and Calabar and you can now feel the heat of Daura and how close it is to the desert,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said the NYSC scheme was well thought-out to unite the country through understanding.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly about the NYSC and I am wishing you all the very best. I assure you that you will be much better as Nigerians after your experience,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the corps members two cows from his farm, 20 bags of rice and N1, 000,000 (one million naira).\n\nExpressing their gratitude, the Corps Liaison Officer, Umaru Babayo, thanked President Buhari for all the efforts and sacrifices to restore peace in the country, and the policies to diversify the economy, with agriculture as the main driver.\n\nHe said the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk, had shown a lot of kindness and warmth to corps members as well in his domain, appreciating the community for always supporting them.\n\nFaruk assured the president of prayers for a successful tenure in office, and God\u2019s providence in decision making that would move the country forward.\n\nOn 2.5% of Nigerian arable land\n\nIn a related development, President Buhari has urged more Nigerians to embrace farming, saying he was surprised to hear only 2.5 per cent of arable lands in the country was being cultivated.\n\nPresident Buhari told newsmen at his residence in Daura, after the Eid-el-Kabir prayers, that the Presidential Economic Advisory Council notified him that only a small percentage of the land in the country was being used for farming, directing security outfits to work more with communities to create a more friendly environment for farmers.\n\nThe president mandated security outfits to be more relentless in maintaining peace in the country, and ensure a more harmonious relationship with communities so that they can glean intelligence.\n\nHe said the security situation had improved considerably over time in the North East and South South, and efforts were being made in North Central and North West, assuring that more would be done to fish out those that had been troubling the peace of the nation and citizens.\n\nEarlier at the prayer ground, Emir of Daura Faruk Umar Faruk had called on citizens to be more supportive of the president so that he could actualise his vision of improving security and boosting the economy.\n\n\u201cSince the president came into power we have seen some positive changes in the country. May God continue to strengthen the President with good health and courage to bring peace to the country. God will not allow Nigeria to see shame. God has been keeping the country and he will keep the country,\u201d he said.\n\no\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "My Client Is Being Tortured In Cotonou, Igboho\u2019s Lead Counsel Cries Out",
          "text": "The Counsel to Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), has alleged that his client is going through harrowing torture and pains, having been put in chains in a police cell in Cotonou, the capital of the Republic of Benin.\n\nThe Senior Advocate who spoke to our judiciary correspondent, Shola Soyele last night also disclosed that Igboho would appear before a court in Benin by Wednesday morning, for an extradition order.\n\nIgboho was arrested on Monday by the security forces at an airport in Cotonou while trying to flee to Germany. He had earlier been declared a fugitive by the Department of State Services (DSS) and asked to turn himself in.\n\nThere were speculations that Igboho had been released by security operatives in the neighbouring West African nation, however, the counsel said his client was still in custody.\n\nMr Alliyu however stressed that rather than being releases, \u201cIgboho is being treated like an animal in the cell \u201cbased on an order from the above.\n\n\u201cI got a call from a reliable source from the authorities in the Republic of Benin that Sunday Igboho has been put in a very dehumanizing condition in a police cell in Cotonou.\n\n\u201cThe police source told me that they are under instruction by an order from above that Igboho should be chained like an animal waiting to be slaughtered. He told me that Igboho was tightly chained to the floor and he is in serious pain.\n\n\u201cWhile I was talking to the police officer on the telephone, I could hear our client crying and asking that the chains should be removed as he is in pain. But the officer told him that they cannot remove the chains as they are acting on instruction,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Sunday Igboho Arrested In Benin Republic\n\nAlliyu, also restated that the extradition order being sought for by the Nigerian authorities may not likely sail through, given the status of Igboho as a political offender.\n\n\u201cI know that our client, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho Oosa), would be taken to a court in Cotonou, the capital of the Republic of Benin, tomorrow, Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities and security operatives that arrested him would be approaching the court for an extradition order to bring Sunday Igboho back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut it is not likely that the extradition order being sought for would sail through. This is because of the status of our client as a political offender who enjoys immunity against extradition.\n\n\u201cLike I said in a press release earlier today, even his arrest by security operatives was against the political nature of his offense.\n\n\u201cThere is an existing extradition treaty between four West African countries, including Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, and Republic, which grants Igboho immunity from being extradited from the Republic of Benin.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana, and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution, the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\n\u201cArticle 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries,\u201d he said.\n\nRaid on Igboho\u2019s house and arrest of Yoruba Nation Agitators\n\nOn July 1, the Department of State Services (DSS) said a team of joint security operatives raided the home of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho in Ibadan, arresting 13 of his armed men.\n\nDSS Spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya in a briefing with journalists said the raid was based on intelligence that Igboho was stockpiling arms to cause chaos within the region.\n\nAfunanya said when the security operatives approached the house, they were attacked by nine of Igboho\u2019s boys who engaged them in a gun duel but were subsequently overpowered.\n\nAccording to him, two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed while an operative sustained injuries, however, Igboho escaped during the gun battle and is currently on the run.\n\nAfunanya who said the long arm of the law will still reach Igboho, urged the agitator to turn himself in or be tracked down.\n\nThe 13 suspected armed agitators that were arrested consist of 12 males and 1 female. A large cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered by the operatives.",

          "text": "Giannis Antetokounmpo had the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in one arm, the NBA Finals MVP trophy in the other and there was a cigar on the table in front of him.\n\nAll the work it took to lift the Milwaukee Bucks from a team that won 15 games when he was a rookie to one with 16 wins this postseason was finally finished.\n\n\u201cThis is time to celebrate,\u201d Antetokounmpo said.\n\nMilwaukee waited 50 years for that.\n\nAntetokounmpo ended one of the greatest NBA Finals ever with 50 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns 105-98 on Tuesday night to win an entertaining series 4-2 and cap off a joyous return to a fan-filled postseason after last year\u2019s NBA bubble.\n\nIt was the third game this series with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds for Antetokounmpo, a dominant debut finals performance that takes its place among some of the game\u2019s greatest.\n\nAntetokounmpo finished with 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game while shooting 61.8%, the first player in finals history to reach those numbers.\n\nHe shot 16 for 25 from the field and made an unbelievable 17-of-19 free throws \u2014 a spectacular showing for any shooter, let alone one who was hitting just 55.6% in the postseason and was ridiculed for it at times.\n\n\u201cPeople told me I can\u2019t make free throws and I made them tonight. And I\u2019m a freaking champion,\u201d Antetokounmpo said.\n\nHe hopped around the court waving his arms with 20 seconds remaining to encourage fans to cheer, but there was no need.\n\nTheir voices had been booming inside and outside for hours by then, having waited 50 years to celebrate a winner after Lew Alcindor \u2014 before becoming Kareem Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 and Oscar Robertson led the Bucks to their first championship in 1971.\n\n\u201cFor the city, I\u2019m sure it means everything,\u201d said Khris Middleton, the other player left from that 15-67 team in 2013-14. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen the work that we put in over the years for them to get to this point.\u201d\n\nIn a season played played largely without fans, the Bucks had 65,000 of them packed into the Deer District outside, a wild party that figured to last deep into the Midwestern night.\n\nThe party wasn\u2019t bad inside, either: Confetti rained down inside as fans chanted \u201cBucks in 6! Bucks in 6!\u201d \u2014 a hopeful boast by former player that turned out to be a prophetic rallying cry.\n\n\u201cI hope they enjoyed it just like we are now,\u201d Middleton added.\n\nThe Bucks became the fifth team to win the NBA Finals after trailing 2-0 and the first to do it by winning the next four games since Miami against Dallas in 2006.\n\nChris Paul scored 26 points to end his first NBA Finals appearance in his 16th season.\n\nDevin Booker added 19 points but shot just 8 for 22 and missed all seven 3-pointers after scoring 40 points in each of the last two games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a pain that goes with your season being over,\u201d Suns coach Monty Williams said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never dealt with this and so I\u2019m grateful, like I said, but I know this is going to hurt for a while.\u201d\n\nThe teams that came into the NBA together as expansion clubs in 1968 delivered a fine finals, with the last three games all in the balance deep into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bucks won them largely because of Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP in the regular season who raised his game even higher in the finals and was voted the unanimous NBA Finals MVP.\n\nHe was the star of these finals in every way, from his powerful play on the court to his humble thoughts in interviews to taking time after Tuesday night\u2019s win to find children to high-five amid the celebrations.\n\nHe teared up afterward talking about the sacrifices his family endured while he grew up in Greece.\n\nHe did all this after missing the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee, an injury he feared could be serious enough to end his season.\n\nJust think what people would have missed.\n\nWhat started as a gradual rise for Antetokounmpo and the Bucks sped up in the last few years and they thought they might be here the last two seasons.\n\nThey had the NBA\u2019s best record in 2018-19 but blew a 2-0 lead against Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThey came back with the best record again last season but never regained their momentum after the season was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic in March. They were eliminated in the second round by Miami in the bubble.\n\nThe Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday before this season and even though they weren\u2019t quite as strong in the regular season, they were finally NBA Finals ready.\n\nAnd Milwaukee was ready for the moment.\n\nMiddleton scored 17 points and Bobby Portis came off the bench with 16.\n\nHoliday had 12 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds to go along with his usual sturdy defense that helped finally cool off Booker.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a credit to the players,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing. We\u2019ve been trying to get better.\n\nThe players embrace everything. They\u2019re amazingly coachable. They take it, soak it in and make the best of it.\u201d\n\nFans began filling the streets and restaurants in the afternoon on what felt like a holiday in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Brewers moved up the start time of their home game against Kansas City to be played in the afternoon to accommodate Milwaukee fans \u2014 and Brewers star Christian Yelich, who was part of the crowd inside Fiserv Forum.\n\nThe game was tied at 77 after three quarters but Antetokoumpo had 13 points in the fourth to make sure Milwaukee wouldn\u2019t have to go back to Phoenix for Game 7 on Thursday.\n\nThe Suns returned to the postseason for the first time since 2010 but remain without a title and have never won more than two games in their three appearances in the NBA Finals.\n\n\u201cNobody probably expected us to be where we are except for us,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut it is what it is. Like I said all season long with our team, ain\u2019t no moral victories.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSuns: The Suns scored their fewest points in a first quarter in this postseason when they had 16. \u2026 Deandre Ayton, who was shooting 67.6% in the postseason, was 4 of 12 for 12 points.\n\nBucks: Brook Lopez had 10 points and eight rebounds. \u2026 Milwaukee\u2019s only other NBA Finals appearance was a loss in 1974.",

          "text": "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), has thrown his weight behind the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics, even as a surge in the Delta variant drives a resurgence of COVID-19 around the world and the event faces continued opposition just days before the opening ceremony.\n\nSpeaking to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Tokyo, Ghebreyesus, acknowledged the scale of the problem posed by the pandemic but drew parallels between the Olympic spirit and the need for governments and people around the world to work together to beat the virus.\n\n\u201cMay these Games be the moment that unites the world, and ignites the solidarity and determination we need to end the pandemic together, by vaccinating 70 percent of the population of every country by the middle of next year,\u201d the WHO chief said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMay the Olympic torch be a symbol of hope that traverses the planet. And may the rays of hope from this land of the rising sun illuminate a new dawn for a world that is healthier, safer and fairer.\u201d\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were forced into an unprecedented delay after the WHO declared a pandemic in March last year. Organisers have introduced a slew of measures, designed in conjunction with the WHO, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and ensure the Games remain safe and secure.\n\nBut rising cases around the world and in Japan, have undermined public confidence, increasing opposition to the event going ahead.\n\nTokyo recorded 1,387 new cases on Tuesday, bringing its total since the pandemic started to more than 840,000 cases. Some 15,055 people in Japan have died from the disease and more than 4.1 million worldwide.\n\nDozens of cases have already been linked to the Olympics, including a number of athletes, which has further undermined public trust in coronavirus mitigation efforts.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is a test. And the world is failing,\u201d Ghebreyesus told the IOC meeting.\n\n\u201cMore than four million people have died and more continue to die. Already this year, the number of deaths is more than double last year\u2019s total. In the time it takes me to make these remarks, more than 100 people will lose their lives to COVID-19. And by the time the Olympic flame is extinguished on the 8th of August, more than 100,000 more people will perish.\u201d\n\nHe noted that people around the world were \u201csick and tired\u201d of the virus and wanted the pandemic to be over but he said this could not happen until more people in more countries were vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe threat is not over anywhere until it\u2019s over everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who thinks the pandemic is over because it\u2019s over where they live is living in a fool\u2019s paradise.\u201d\n\nRounding on wealthier nations, the WHO chief said that the world had not made the best use of the vaccines that had been developed, with 75 percent of shots administered in just 10 countries. In low-income countries, only 1 percent of people have received at least one dose, compared with more than half the population in high-income countries, he said.\n\nVaccines had been \u201cconcentrated in the hands and arms of the lucky few\u201d he said, adding that the failure to share vaccines, tests and treatments was increasing a two-track pandemic that was not only a \u201cmoral outrage\u201d but risked heightening the emergence of new, perhaps more deadly, variants of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of this pandemic is that it could have been under control by now, if vaccines had been allocated more equitably,\u201d he said, adding that pharmaceutical companies should put profits and patents second in order to ensure wider access to vaccines.\n\nThe WHO, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the World Trade Organization are supporting a global push to vaccinate at least 10 percent of the population of every country by September, at least 40 percent by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of 2022.\n\nGhebreyesus also reiterated the importance of public health measures beyond vaccines \u2013 including testing, contact tracing, and quarantine \u2013 to control the spread of the virus.\n\nMany of the measures form part of the rules included in the Olympics\u2019 Playbook, which are supposed to help keep athletes, officials and media safe while they are in Japan and minimise the risk from coronavirus. Most events will be held in empty venues.\n\nThe WHO chief said the \u201d mark of success\u201d was not zero cases but that cases were identified, isolated, traced and cared for.\n\nSome 79 cases have been reported in connection with the event so far, according to official figures, with the opening ceremony due to take place on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn the 125-year history of the modern games, they have been held in the shadow of war, economic crisis and geopolitical turmoil. But never before have they been organised in the shadow of a pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although COVID-19 might have postponed the games, it has not defeated them.\u201d",

It has had fewer than 1,000 Covid deaths.\n\nBut the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant has created new challenges and exposed Australia\u2019s poor vaccination rate.\n\nDespite entering lockdown late last month, Sydney reported 110 new cases on Wednesday, taking its current outbreak to more than 1,300 cases.\n\nResidents must not leave their homes except for grocery shopping, exercise and other essential reasons.\n\nConstruction sites and specialty retail stores have also been closed.\n\nThere are fears Sydney\u2019s shutdown could be extended into September, after modelling showed the city may need months to reach zero new cases.\n\nMany Australians have compared their situation to re-openings happening in the UK and the US, placing pressure on the federal government.\n\nLast month, a total of seven cities were in lockdown for a brief period.\n\nAustralian authorities have committed to eliminating local cases altogether until more people are vaccinated.\n\nLess than 14% of Australians have been vaccinated \u2013 the slowest rate among OECD nations.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s government has been strongly criticised, after he said early this year that the vaccine rollout \u201cwas not a race\u201d.\n\nThe slow vaccine uptake has been blamed on the government\u2019s failure to secure Pfizer supplies and public fears about very rare clotting from the AstraZeneca jab.",

Surveys suggest there is widespread vaccine hesitancy in France.\n\nMr Macron\u2019s plans have proved controversial. Protests against new coronavirus rules in France saw demonstrators vandalising two vaccination centres this week.\n\n\u201cHealth Dictatorship\u201d is what protesters here are calling it.\n\nIf the government has its way, in a few short weeks, you won\u2019t be able to sit down for a coffee at a Paris caf\u00e9 \u2013 or board a train \u2013 without proof that you\u2019re Covid-free, vaccinated or immune.\n\nThis so-called Health Pass is the government\u2019s answer to infection rates that are rising faster than France has ever seen in this pandemic.\n\nAlready, from today, there\u2019ll be no routine access to cinemas, theatres, museums \u2013 no trips to Disneyland Paris \u2013 without it.\n\nBut it\u2019s the plan to extend that restriction to everyday public places \u2013 cafes, shopping centres and public transport \u2013 that\u2019s causing the biggest backlash.\n\nSome MPs have reported receiving death threats ahead of the debate today.\n\nAnd some protesters sparked fury last week by comparing these government restrictions to the singling out of Jews during France\u2019s war-time Nazi occupation.\n\nA majority of French people appear to support the plan, with many believing it\u2019s the only way to avoid yet another lockdown.",
