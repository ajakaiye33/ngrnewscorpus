          "text": "Two female jobseekers were reportedly rescued after they were allegedly kidnapped by suspected body part dealers in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nAn online post by a rights activist, Israel Joe, said the women were abducted last week by two men in a mini bus and taken to a forest.\n\nThe activist said the women were stripped and their nude photos sent to their families with threats of killing them if the relations failed to pay N5m ransom, adding that the women watched as others victims, whose families could not pay, were killed.\n\nAccording to the post, the young women were released after a ransom of N200,000 was paid.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rivers State Police Command has ordered an investigation into a viral video on the social media where one of the women claimed that she was abducted and taken to a forest in the Etche Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, said this in a statement issued by the command\u2019s spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, in Port Harcourt.\n\nIn the video, the woman said she was kidnapped after boarding a tricycle in Iwofe, near Port Harcourt, beaten and taken to the said forest.\n\nShe corroborated the activist\u2019s post that that while in the forest, the abductors stripped her and sent her nude photos to her family members and demanded N3m ransom.\n\nShe said in her presence, about seven abductees were killed, adding that the hoodlums spared her because she had previously given birth.\n\nThe victim stated, \u201cThey (kidnappers) touched my breast and said because I had given birth, they shoved me to one side. They said they were looking for people who hadn\u2019t given birth.\n\n\u201cThey said I had given birth and that I was of no use, because they were looking for women who had not given birth.\n\n\u201cThey were slaughtering people that hadn\u2019t given birth in my presence. I was crying and wondering what would happen to me.\n\n\u201cThe next thing was that they took my naked photos and sent to my people for them to pay N3m. They don\u2019t have that kind of money, so they were pleading.\n\n\u201cFriends from various areas started helping. The little they gathered, they gave them with pleading. People were crying and begging.\n\n\u201cThey killed about seven persons in my presence. Even there was a lady suffering from asthma, she died on my laps and they threw her body inside a pit.\u201d\n\nThe lady also alleged that a woman, who travelled from Lagos to Port Harcourt to visit a male friend, also fell into the hands of the miscreants, adding that some persons were coming to their den to buy human parts.\n\nShe added, \u201cFacebook friends, I saw somebody that they brought there. She said she came from Lagos to look for someone. They slaughtered her and sold her parts. She had not given birth before.\n\n\u201cNigerians should help and do something because people are being killed in Rivers State. Mini-buses, tinted vehicles and tricycles are risky. People should be careful.\u201d\n\nBut the CP said in the statement that the police had studied the video and asked the woman to lodge a complaint at a police station closest to her.\n\nThe statement read in part,\u201d The attention of the Rivers State Police Command has been drawn to a viral video on social media by a middle-aged lady with startling revelations about her ordeal in the hands of kidnappers in a forest in the Etche LGA of Rivers State, where she was harassed and tortured, before her eventual release.\n\n\u201cThe command has carefully studied the video and has found it expedient to react as follows: That the issues raised in the viral video be and are hereby ordered to be investigated, to ascertain their veracity. That the command wishes to appeal to the general public and indeed the young lady to access the nearest police station and lodge her complaint for necessary action.\n\n\u201cThat the Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, wishes to reassure the public that there is no cause for alarm as undercover operatives have been deployed for that purpose. Residents of the state are advised to remain calm and ignore certain misguided posts on social media capable of creating fear and panic in the minds of residents of the state.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Babajide Komolafe\n\nCost of funds in the interbank money market rose to 19.2 per cent last week, defying N515 billion inflow during the week.\n\nThe inflow comprised N110 billion from matured secondary market (Open Market Operations, OMO) treasury bills, N14.91 billion from FGN Bond Coupon payment and statutory allocation of N390 billion from Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) to the state.\n\nThe impact of the inflow was, however, cancelled by outflow comprising N87.95 billion through Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTB) issuance, N41 billion through OMO bills auction, debit for Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and foreign exchange auction.\n\nConsequently, cost of funds rose by 220 basis points with interest rate on overnight lending rising to 19.2 per cent last week from 17 per cent the previous week.\n\nSimilarly interest rate on Collateralised (Open Buy Back, OBB) lending rose to 18.7 per cent last week from 16.5 per cent the previous week. Analysts were, however, divided in their projections as to whether this trend will persist this week.\n\nProjecting that interbank interest rates will move in different directions this week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited, said: \u201cIn the new week, treasury bills worth N55.46 billion will mature via OMO; hence, we expect interbank rates to move in mixed directions amid marginal inflow of matured OMO bills.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, analysts at Afrinvest Securities said: \u201cAt the start of the week, OBB and Overnight rates fell 1.5percentage points (ppts) and 1.8ppts to settle at 15.0% and 15.3% respectively from last Friday as system liquidity closed at 486.5 billion. By the end of the week, the rates closed at 18.7% and 19.2%, down 2.2ppts and 3.0ppts week-on week.\n\n\u201cIn the coming week, OMO maturities worth 55.5 billion will impact system liquidity. Thus, we expect CBN to keep rates and system liquidity in check through regular auctions.\n\nOn their part, analysts at Cordros Securities said: \u201cWe expect system liquidity to remain tight and the OVN rate to trend northwards in the absence of any significant inflows to the system.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

We have told them. We sent all our judgments to them and we told them they should not investigate anything because there\u2019s nothing to investigate again. We have gotten judgement, but rather, they should ensure that the judgment is executed.\n\nAccording to Ikimi,\u201dWe sent all the judgments to them. So, we are waiting for them to prevail on the IGP to pay us.\n\n\u201cThey say we should come to Abuja, write statements, bring money, mobilize them. It\u2019s still the same order. So, I told them that we have passed that stage of investigation.\n\n\u201cYou know they called me from Abuja that they want to investigate the matter. So, I wrote back to National Human Rights Commission. All the papers are with me, telling them that we don\u2019t need that. We have gotten judgments and that they should ensure that the judgment is obeyed by the IGP. So, they now wrote me asking, did I serve them? I now replied. I said we have served them. All Certified True Copies of the judgment. So, they should prevail on the IGP to ensure that the judgment is obeyed.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that the five journalists were unlawfully arrested and detained on Tuesday May 26,2020.\n\nThe five Journalists who were not happy with the way they were maltreated, dragged the IGP Monitoring Unit to Court where they filed a fundamental right suit claiming damages.",

Tidings to make us pause and ponder over our current situation and where it\u2019ll lead us to in the future. Today, I ask my fellow youth, who is going to benefit from the destruction of institutions that are established to secure our people?\n\n\u201cFive decades after the civil war ended when our parents had managed to make a meaningful progress from the ruins of the war, the little infrastructure we have, we are destroying. The peace we are known for, has become a scarce commodity. The bloodshed we have wiped off our minds has resumed flow on our soil? Why? Our aged are in panic, our children are confused and in fear. Wwhatend are we bent on destroying our land?\n\n\u201cHowever, our victory must not come in us turning against our collective future. Our victory will come through consistent and very difficult negotiations and renegotiations that must take place.The memories of forebears will not and must not be revisited through violence.

          "text": "Fulani herdsmen hitherto grazing in the South Eastern part of Nigeria, have reportedly fled the zone and are now settling in some communities in Ogbadibo, Okpokwu, Ado and other Local Government Areas of Benue State.\n\nThe invasion may not be unconnected to the current unrest in the Southeast birthed by the activities of the Eastern Security Network, ESN which was established by the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB to stop the activities of herdsmen in the region.\n\nThe recent resolve by the Southern Governors who banned open grazing in the region may have also triggered the sudden relocation to neighbouring communities.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the communities in the aforementioned Local Government Areas are neighbouring villages to some parts of Enugu and Ebonyi States.\n\nOgbadibo and parts of Okpokwu are bordered by Udenu Local Government of Enugu State while parts of Ado, particularly the Agila community is bordered by Ebele village, Ngbo in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the herders are currently settling in some of the communities, triggering tension in the areas.\n\nAn opinion leader and head of a community in Owukpa in Ogbadibo, Chief Akogwu Agada told DAILY POST correspondent that some parts of the community have been occupied by the herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThey are everywhere here in Owukpa but their major base is in Ankpa. They have clashed with our farmers several times due to the destruction of crops by their cattle.\n\n\u201cWe will be glad if the government can come to our aid to chase them out of our land before they resort to attacking and killings us here\u201d, Chief Akogwu noted.\n\nA member of the recently disbanded vigilante group, Mr Apochi Adams who spoke with our correspondent from Ichama in Okpokwu Local Government, narrated a similar incident.\n\nAccording to him, there is no part of the community that the herdsmen are not using for grazing.\n\n\u201cWe have clashed with them several times trying to send them away from our land but they always resist\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, A farmer, Mr James Adoga who spoke with our correspondent from Orokamu in Ogbadibo, lamented how his casava plantation was destroyed by the herders who grazed on his farm.\n\nAdoga revealed that the herders stormed the community recently with their cattle, family and other property to settle in some of the villages.\n\n\u201cWe are helpless in this place. Farming is the only business we use to survive and the Fulani men have come to destroy our only source of hope.\n\n\u201cWhen we see them on our land, and we complain, they threaten to kill us and due to news we have been getting from far places, we have no courage to confront them,\u201d he stated.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the development is coming despite the efforts of the state government to enforce the open grazing prohibition law across the 23 LGs of the state.\n\nRecall that the state governor, Samuel Ortom in 2017 signed the Anti-Open Grazing bills into law as a measure to end the incessant crisis between farmers and herdsmen.\n\nHowever, the herders who were angered by the law, have continued to unleash terror on residents of communities in relatively all parts of the state.\n\nRecently, there was a surge in the deadly attacks as many residents have been butchered while over one million others were displaced across the three senatorial districts in the state.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that armed men suspected to be Fulani militias, on Thursday night killed 36 residents of Shikaan Mbagena Kpav community in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe armed men invaded the community and slaughtered scores at midnight when residents were fast asleep. 36 bodies were recovered while an unspecified number of persons sustained various degrees of injuries.\n\nRecently, gunmen suspected to be herdsmen also attacked the Tse Amgbem community near Aondoana in Gwer West Local Government Area of the State, killing 11 persons as residents deserted the community and increased the number of Internally Displaced Persons camped across the state.\n\nThe Gwer West Local Government Chairman, Mrs Grace Igbabon who confirmed the incident to DAILY POST, lamented how his people were sacked from their ancestral homes by the militias.\n\nSimilarly, a few weeks ago, about seven persons were confirmed dead, with many others injured, after armed Fulani herdsmen attacked Abagena community housing Internally Displaced Persons camp in Makurdi Local government Area of the State.\n\nSubsequently, the youths, who were angered by the killings, stormed the Makurdi-Lafia road with the lifeless bodies of the deceased to protest incessant attacks on their communities.\n\nReacting, the State Governor, Samuel Ortom in a statement, described the attack on the IDPs camp as inhuman, barbaric and unacceptable. The Governor called on President Muhammadu Buhari to live up to his responsibility of protecting lives of Nigerians.\n\nSame week, more than 17 persons were confirmed dead while many others injured after militia herdsmen attacked Tse-Ayeli village, Tse-Gborigyo and Udam in Mbayer-Yandev in Guma Local Government Area of the State.\n\nRecall that on March 20, 2021, the governor narrowly escaped death when militia herdsmen launched an attack on his convoy while returning from his farm at Tyo-mu along Makurdi \u2013 Gboko road.\n\nEfforts by DAILY POST correspondent to speak with Terver Akase, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor on the recent influx of the Fulani herders in some parts of the state proved abortive as he was unable to take his calls and could not respond to text messages forwarded to him.\n\nSimilarly, when contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene Sewuese was unable to speak, but requested that a text message be sent to her. She did not, however, respond to the text message forwarded to her.\n\nHowever, Ortom had a few days ago, told residents of the state to defend themselves with Dane guns and other weapons not prohibited by the law, when attacked by gunmen.\n\nOrtom gave the directive at an inter-denominational church service held at the government house in Makurdi, Benue capital on Sunday, May 23.\n\n\u201cI will no longer announce the deaths of those killed by Fulani herdsmen, rise and defend yourselves with weapons not prohibited by law, bows and arrows, spears and knives.\n\n\u201cGet a licence for Dane guns from local government chairmen and use them to defend yourselves.\n\n\u201cGod assured me some time back that as long as I lived within the circle of his presence, no weapon fashioned against me shall prosper,\u201d he said.",

As agents moved in, they opened fire and tried to use residents as shield.\n\n\u201cThe six hoodlums who carried out the killings and four other members of their gang were fatally injured.

The declaration of Biafra independence by General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu must always stand,\u201d he said.\n\nThis came as the various police commands threatened to crush any form of procession or gathering relating to Biafra today.\n\nIn Onitsha, tension started building up on Saturday, May 29, following an alleged shooting of soldiers at Ihiala Local Government Area of the state by suspected gunmen which caused gridlock for hours at the Onitsha bridgehead due to tight security check there.\n\nThere was show-of-force patrol by joint-security forces along roads and streets of Onitsha and its environs, ostensibly to instil fear in anybody trying to cause breach of peace and breakdown of law and order.\n\nWithin the week, there was rush by people to the markets to make purchases and stock foodstuff due to fear of unknown during the exercise.\n\nAnnouncements were made in various churches in Onitsha during the services, advising worshippers to obey the sit-at-home order today to avoid any possible attack or being hit by stray bullets.\n\nAttendance in many churches was scanty due to fear, as many people assumed the sit-at-home started yesterday as it used to.\n\nChairman of Onitsha Main Market Association, Kenneth Onyeka, said the market will remain open for business.\n\nOne of the traders, Johnson Dikemba, told Daily Sun that for the past few years when Biafra Day was marked, the major markets in the Onitsha shut down to respect their fathers, grandfathers and mothers who lost their lives during the civil war.\n\nDecide what you want, Umahi tells residents\n\nEbonyi Governor, David Umahi, yesterday, seemingly recanted as he asked residents of the state to feel free to participate in the sit-at-home exercise if they so wished.\n\nThe governor had, on a statewide broadcast on Saturday evening to mark his six years in office, directed Ebonyi people to go about their normal businesses today.\n\nUmahi also said he had withdrawn his earlier threat to punish any trader who closed his shop in obedience to the order, saying it was within the rights of anyone to sit at home.\n\nHis Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, who addressed a press conference in Abakaliki, yesterday, said: \u201cEbonyi government has received several requests from some families and residents of the state, requesting they would like to remain indoors today to organise private family prayers in honour of their loved ones who were murdered during the civil war. Some of the people with this special request own shops in some of our markets across the state.\n\n\u201cWhile as a government, we remain resolute in the protection of lives and property of Ebonyians and all residents of Ebonyi State, we are aware that it is the right of anyone to remain at home or go about his/her normal businesses in this regard.\n\n\u201cFollowing the foregoing, Governor Umahi, who is highly in touch with the people has directed that those who may wish to remain at home with their shop(s) locked should neither be penalised, nor their shop(s) seized as it is their constitutional right while the rights of those who may wish to go about their normal businesses should not be infringed upon as it is equally their constitutional right.\u201d\n\nAnambra, Imo, Enugu, Abia set for sit-at-home\n\nIn Anambra, preparations for the sit-at-home appeared to have started on Saturday as there was panic buying by the residents of the state. Many residents thronged the markets to buy food stuffs that would last them till Tuesday.\n\nFood stuff markets all opened yesterday for business as those returning from churches were also seen stopping over to buy food items.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command said it was adequately prepared to ensure there would be no breakdown of law and order in the state.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Daily Sun: \u201cWe are not deterred by the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate of protecting lives and property.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, said: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, today (yesterday) is the anniversary of the creation of Biafra. And Anambra State Government, in 2016, became the first and only administration in history to honour the memory of those who died in the fight for freedom.\n\n\u201cAmong the people who attended the solemn ceremony at Ekwueme Square was Alex Ekwueme, Nigeria\u2019s first vice president. So, tomorrow (today) is not a public holiday.\u201d\n\nAsked if the civil service and schools would open today, he responded with a question: \u201cDid you hear that the government is closing down any school or declaring a public holiday or work free day? Tomorrow is just another day.\u201d\n\nAs at late yesterday evening, Imo residents appeared set to comply with the order IPOB order.\n\nRoads were getting completely deserted while most shops which normally opened on Sundays remained locked.\n\nAlso, many churches in the urban areas witnessed low turnout of worshipers while those that managed to hold services hurriedly closed.\n\nHowever, the police had assured residents of their safety, noting they had activated every tactical means to make sure no lives or property would be lost in the state today.\n\nSimilarly, a wave of uncertainty enveloped Enugu State, yesterday, ostensibly because of recent security threats.\n\nSo, many residents said they would like to stay indoors today to avoid unpleasant incidents.\n\nSome who are Federal Government workers said they would watch out first before taking any action, \u201cnow that the Federal Government facilities are targets.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, warned anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the relative peace and security enjoyed in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt would be vehemently resisted.\n\nHowever, residents of Abia State have braced up for the exercise even as police called on the people to ignore the order.\n\nMost residents of the state already see today as a public holiday as they bought most of what they would use on Monday, on Friday and Saturday.\n\nIn some churches across the state, yesterday, adherents were asked to remain at home as not to be victims of any clash between security agents and Biafra agitators.\n\nCommercial vehicle and tricycle operators spoken to said they would be off the streets in compliance with the order.\n\nAlthough, the state government did not issue order for closure of markets, some traders, who spoke to Daily Sun, said they would stay at home to avoid any trouble.\n\nDeal with troublemakers \u2013Delta CP\n\nCommissioner of Police in Delta, Ari Muhammed Ali, yesterday, urged his officers to deal decisively with troublemakers in any part of the state.\n\nAli warned that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting Biafra flag in whatever guise in the state.\n\nHis warning is coming on the heels of the sit-at-home order for today by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAli, in a statement, yesterday, by the acting Public Relations Officer of the command, Bright Edafe, said undercover police detectives have been deployed across the state to arrest anyone caught carrying Biafra flag, and ensure they are dealt with accordance with the law of the land.",

All passengers are advised to avoid the long arm of the law and act in good conscience by adhering to the guidelines to protect the lives and livelihood of all Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of the new guidelines and the ban on non-Nigerians travelling from three countries (India, Brazil and Turkey) into Nigeria, Lagos State has recorded 568 in-bound passengers, who have been permitted to enter Nigeria from these three countries. We have isolated 433 passengers in our various accredited hotels and facilities; 262 are in Isolation and 154 passengers have been discharged with a negative COVID-19 test.\n\n\u201cNine have tested positive to COVID-19 and successfully isolated to prevent community transmission. Of the remaining 135 passengers, 119 have refused isolation and 16 are unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOn May 24, 2021, the Presidential Steering Committee led by Mr. Boss Mustapha and working together with the COVID-19 response in Lagos State, led by the Incident Commander, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, published a first list of defaulters of the laid down protocols travelling through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport as it relates to the red listed countries (India, Brazil and Turkey).\n\n\u201cAll passengers affected should contact the lead of our Case Management Unit, Dr. Abimbola Bowale, on [email protected] who will verify their status. The list of names who may have been mistakenly placed on this list and have been cleared will be sent to the Presidential Steering Committee for removal from the published names.\n\n\u201cHowever, all passengers that have been confirmed absconders will have their passports deactivated for a minimum of 1 year, if Nigerian and if foreign, will have their resident permits cancelled and deported as stated by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAll absconders will also face the penalties of the coronavirus pandemic Law 2021 of Lagos State, including varying lengths of prison time up to one year and fines of up to N500,000. All affected passengers are to present themselves to the Yaba Mainland Hospital for assessment and COVID-19 tests to evaluate their status.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner who warned against third wave of the COVID-19 wave, said regardless of the reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the state is yet to reach its target. \u201cGiven the requirement for achieving herd immunity (60 per cent of total population vaccinated), the state still needs to vaccinate about 14,000,000 (14 Million).\n\n\u201cHowever, the state would ensure ramp up testing by carrying out COVID-19 tests on all travelers.",

police checkpoint at Neni, Anaocha LGA; Obosi Police Station in Idemili North LGA; B Police Division in Awka; Ozubulu Police Station in Ekwusigo Local Government Area and zonal police headquarters in Ukpor, Dunukofia LGA.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the five states of Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Ebonyi, at the weekend stockpiled foods and other necessities ahead of today\u2019s sit-at-home order issued by IPOB in honour of those who died during the Nigeria-Biafra Civil war.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that residents of the five states have been involved in panic-buying for fear of the unknown.\n\nIPOB had asked states in the South-east to observe a sit-at-home today in remembrance of gallant soldiers and others who lost their lives during the Biafran civil war.\n\nIn Enugu State, the police, however, have assured residents of the state that there is no cause for alarm as steps have been taken to ensure the protection of lives and property.\n\nBut the residents in the state over the weekend, trooped to the popular Ogbete market to shop for their various needs ahead of today\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the market on Friday and Saturday, there was a surge in the number of people who went to shop for food items and other needs.\n\nThose who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity, said they were going to comply with the sit-at-home order.\n\nHowever, the Enugu State Police Command has asked residents of the state to disregard the sit-at-home order and to go about their normal business.\n\nIn a statement given to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Mr. Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, enjoined residents to disregard the order.\n\nHe warned any anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the peace in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt will be resisted.\n\nAliyu assured the residents of the commitment of the police to collaborate with other security agencies to guarantee public security and safety.\n\nHe called on parents and guardians as well as religious, traditional, town union, market, youth and other leaders to caution their subjects against allowing themselves to be used to cause trouble.\n\nHe also urged residents to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they go about their legitimate businesses, and promptly report criminal elements to the nearest police station.\n\nInvestigation revealed that there may be a compliance with the sit-at-home order in Ebonyi State, following the fear of possible attack on violators.\n\nA businessman who spoke to THISDAY that no one would risk his life to go to shop.\n\nMajority of residents who spoke on the directive said they would obey it.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, has threatened to seize any shop not opened for business in compliance with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe governor also directed security agencies to protect Ebonyi people against attacks from non-state actors seeking to enforce compliance with the sit-at-home order.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cI have been getting voices from some agitators that tomorrow there will be no movement. This is foolishness. If there is no movement in South-east, will there be no movement in the whole country?\n\n\u201cWhat an Ebonyi man will never accept is to go into second slavery under any guise. We know the Biafra we need, it is to have money so that we can cleanse off the toga of slavery that our brothers and sisters subjected us into. If you love Ebonyi State, bring money, come and put up one construction.\n\n\u201cWe want to see your investment in Ebonyi State. I want to say there will be free movement throughout today, throughout tomorrow and going forward and I challenge the youths, security agencies, local government chairmen to ensure that nobody is molested.\u201d\n\nResidents of Abia State were also in a panic mode yesterday following the weekend attacks on the State Crime Investigation Department(CID) in Umuahia and the sit-at-home order.\n\nPeople barely managed to attend church services yesterday amidst the already tensed situation. They rushed home as soon as church services were over.\n\nPeople were seen drifting to Isi Gate, the only area of the city where they could buy household needs as regular markets and most shops do not usually open on Sundays.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring,\u201d said Nazi Uzoma Udoka, a resident of Umuahia as he waited with his family to board a tricycle home after the church service.\n\nHe told THISDAY that \u201cevery day comes with uncertainties\u201d adding that \u201cthese days when people go out in the morning, they find it very difficult to return home at the end of the day as ugly incident would have happened and cause the police to block the roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to comply with the stay-at-home order because if you venture out the outcome could be unpleasant,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice spokesman, Geoffrey Ogbonna, a Superintendent of Police, did not pick calls when THISDAY telephoned him to find out preparations to protect the people.\n\nThere was also tension in Anambra State over today\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Eke Awka market, a major market that serves the Anambra State capital and environs on Saturday, residents were seen making purchases of food items.\n\nMany residents were also seen yesterday at the same market in last-minute purchases.\n\nIn most churches in the state, residents were advised to heed the order, if not for anything, for them to be safe.\n\nBut the state police command has called on the people to disregard the order, saying it is doing all it can to protect the people.\n\nSpokesperson of the command, Toochukwu Ikenga, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, told THISDAY that, \u201cWe are not deterred with the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate in protecting lives and property. Just like any other day is, we shall continue to maintain law and order.\n\n\u201cWe (are) also encouraged by the support we have from the Anambra State Government, the citizens and especially Ndi Anambra. We urge them to sustain it. Together we shall police our state effectively.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, the Imo State capital, the residents observed partial sit-at-home during the weekend due to the worsening insecurity in the state.\n\nThe state police command had earlier warned IPOB fighters against disturbing the peace of the state.\n\nDon\u2019t Hoist \u2018Biafra Flag\u2019 in Delta, Police Warn IPOB\n\nAsaba, the Delta State capital, which shares boundary with Onitsha, the commercial city of Anambra State, was calm and peaceful yesterday.\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command has warned members of IPOB not to hoist the \u2018Biafran Flag\u2019 in any part of the state.\n\nThe command, while expressing its preparedness to maintain law and order, warned that its personnel would \u201cdeal ruthlessly\u201d with any attempt by the IPOB or similar groups to cause trouble in any part of Delta State.\n\nA statement by the Delta Police Command spokesman, Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ari Muhammed Ali, had ordered police personnel to be \u201con red alert\u201d because of the IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home directive.\n\n\u201cThe command is aware of the threat of the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB) and their intention of parading themselves in some parts of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Delta State, who is determined to maintain peace in the state, has urged officers and men of the state command to be on red alert, watchful, and deal decisively with the trouble makers.\n\n\u201cThe CP, therefore, warns that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting \u2018Biafra flag\u2019 in whatever guise in the state,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says negotiations ongoing to acquire 20% stake in Dangote Refinery\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has served notice to the Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) that it will deduct about N126 billion from its remittance to the Federation Account at the next meeting scheduled for June.\n\nThis is coming as the Group Managing Director of the corporation, Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote Refinery has not been concluded.\n\nIn a report signed by NNPC\u2019s Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, a copy of which THISDAY obtained at the weekend, the corporation stated that subsequently, it will begin the subtraction of the balance of an additional N50 billion, being Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery to sustain crude oil production level.\n\nIn the document which detailed the status of the corporation\u2019s finances during its monthly FAAC meeting, which took place between May 19 and 20, the NNPC also confirmed that it did not make any remittance to the Federation Account during the period.\n\nThe development may further throw the three tiers of government, federal, states and local governments, into harsher times next month as they may get less from the Federation Account, as a result of the huge payment the NNPC is paying for subsidy on petrol.\n\nIn April, the corporation had notified the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Ahmed Idris, that it would not be able to remit any funds to the Federation Account in April for distribution in May.\n\nNNPC said it posted a value shortfall of N111.966 billion in February 2021, which would ultimately impact on its ability to contribute to the joint account shared among the federal, state and local governments.\n\nThe corporation attributed the N111.966 billion shortfall to the rising average landing cost of petrol, which jumped to N184 per litre in March as opposed to the existing N128 ex-coastal price.\n\nAccording to the corporation, the N111.966 billion incurred as landing cost would be deducted from April oil and gas proceeds due to the federation in May.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the impact on the federation was not as far-reaching as expected because the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), which collects royalties and bonuses on behalf of the federal government, came to the rescue with the remittance of about $500 million it received from the marginal fields it recently put up for bids.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, had confirmed the role played by DPR in augmenting the FAAC allocation for April, which was shared in May.\n\nThe minister, however, did not disclose how much was paid into the account.\n\nBut the NNPC had in a reaction to the dust raised by the letter to the accountant general, stated that the corporation wasn\u2019t broke, adding that the zero revenue projection only had to do with the federation revenue stream, which it manages and not a general reflection of its overall financial performance.\n\nIn the fresh notice raised by the corporation to deduct N126 billion from its remittance in June, it said it was still shouldering the burden of the differentials from the sale of petrol, which it prefers to call \u201cunder-recovery\u201d.\n\nThe FAAC document added: \u201cNo remittance to Federation Account in April, 2021 (May, 2021 FAAC) due to recorded value shortfall resulting from difference between landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sum of N61,966,456,903.74 was deducted out of the total March value shortfall of N111,966,456,903.74. This is to make funds available for JV cost recovery to sustain the existing production level. The balance $50,000,000,000.00 will be deducted in subsequent months.\n\n\u201cIn addition, April value shortfall of N126,298,457,944.36 is to be deducted from May federation proceeds in June 2021 FAAC meeting.\u201d\n\nThe figures further showed that while a net revenue of N90.8 billion was remitted to FAAC in January, N64.1 billion was remitted in February, N41.1 billion was presented in March and zero amount recorded for April.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporation has said that it sold total oil and gas valued at $565.4 million or an equivalent of N214.5 billion in April, according to the document.\n\nNNPC stated that its overall crude oil lifting for both export and domestic in March 2021, recorded 29 per cent decrease relative to the 10.79Mbbls lifted in February 2021.\n\nThe national oil company said Nigeria maintained 1.52 million bpd OPEC production cut in the first quarter of 2021, while export crude oil revenue received in April amounted to $1.89 million, equivalent to N723 million.\n\n\u201cThis represents a 98 per cent decrease compared to March 2021. Domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.13bn,\u201d it added.\n\nIt stated that feedstock valued at $54.6 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.4 million was received during the month, with the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nMCA is a financing agreement whereby the International Oil Companies (IOCs) advance loans to NNPC to invest in upstream projects.\n\nFor other receipts, the corporation stated that $1.25 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in April 2021.\n\nThe data also showed that the exchange rate the CBN sold foreign exchange to the NNPC moved from N379 to N383.47, while N15 billion was spent on government priority projects.\n\nIn the same month, the corporation lost 3.1 million barrels for various reasons, ranging from shut-ins due to repairs, industrial actions, flow line leaks and power failure.\n\nOn the analysis of receipts due in April, gross revenue from JV crude was N124.3 billion, JV gas was N26.1 billion, while N5.8 billion was received from miscellaneous sources, amounting to N156.3 billion.\n\nAfter deduction of royalty, JV cost recovery, profit before tax and taxes, receipts from JV crude came down to N5.5 billion, while that of JV gas stood at N7.8 billion.\n\nOf the March domestic crude oil payable in June by the NNPC, in line with the 90-day payment plan, Chevron Nigeria Limited has roughly 2.89 million barrels valued at N72.6 billion while Eroton\u2019s share is 130,000 barrels valued at N3.1 billion.\n\nAlso, Mobil Producing has 2.84 million litres, valued at N68 billion, Seplat\u2019s is N3.36 billion, SPDC\u2019s share of the JV is N33.6 billion while the value of Total\u2019s crude oil payable in June is N3.1 billion, totalling approximately N184.5 billion or equivalent of $487 million.\n\nAs of March 31, total pre-2016 JV cash call arrears repayment status indicated that JV negotiated debt remained at $4.68 billion, total payment till date is $3.1 billion, while outstanding balance is $1.54 billion, with the exception of Mobil which has been fully paid by the NNPC.\n\nIn April, N938.9 million was spent on security and maintenance, while strategic holdings of the NNPC gulped N740 million, amounting to N1.679 billion.\n\nIn all, 37 vessels imported petrol for the month under review, with landing cost ranging from between N169 and N199.90. Also, a total of N1.48 billion litres were imported for the month, 1.99 billion litres were sold, with depot price remaining at N128 and the recorded loss put at N111.9 billion.\n\nNNPC: Negotiations Ongoing to Acquire Stake in Dangote Refinery,\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote has not been concluded.\n\nKyari, in a text message in response to enquiries by THISDAY on the matter, said the terms of the agreement were being finalised and could be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\nHe added that the NNPC is interested in acquiring a stake in any private refinery with a capacity in excess of 50,000 barrels per day and not just the Dangote Refinery alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Dangote Refinery acquisition, it\u2019s actually an ongoing negotiations that was disclosed by one of our executives. We haven\u2019t concluded; terms are being finalised and may be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to discuss the details at this point. However, the decision is for NNPC to expand her portfolio as is the common practice amongst national oil companies as matter of energy security considerations and risk management. We will take equity from any refinery that plans to process in excess of 50,000 barrels per day, not just the Dangote.\u201d\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated Dangote Refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene, is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce about 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and four million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism?\n\nSaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nOur Experience\n\nOn arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.\n\n\"Who did you come to see?\" he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: \"Is this not a restaurant?\"\n\nThe security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.\n\nThe team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).\n\nThe entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.\n\nIn the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: \"Can I see your menu?\" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there.\n\nWe were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.\n\nThe Wait\n\nAs we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.\n\nShe beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone. Sigh.\n\nWe continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first.\n\nIn a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward \u2018glance lock\u2019, \u2018Camera lady\u2019 approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks.\n\nPlease note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders \"looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms\" in the restaurant.\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nAnd so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions. Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks. A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.\n\nI wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move? Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes). As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.\n\nShe walked up to us and said \"hello\" and stayed there. A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place. One member of the team queried if \"everyone is welcome here?\" to which she simply said \"yes\".\n\nShe then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?). As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery. I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building. How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti?\n\nIt turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo.\n\nMore suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it.\n\nIn the End\n\nFrom our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard\u2019s inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google. There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out. Would they have done all that if we were Chinese?\n\nIn the restaurant's bid to gloss this over, it ended us awarding us an exaggerated reception.",

          "title": "INSIDE STORY: Open defecation, water scarcity... how Sokoto students succumbed to cholera",
          "text": "12:31pm. It\u2019s a sultry Friday afternoon. Lean and tall but with a steady gait, Mustapha Muazu leads TheCable into his home. With a smile spread across his sorrow-induced sunken cheeks, he sits on a mat in his living room \u2014 a space that his \u201cfuture of medicine\u201d used to play and study. He speaks of how, with Hauwau, his daughter who was a student of Government Girls Unity Secondary School in Bodinga LGA of Sokoto state, he wanted to break the jinx of child marriage in the north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe loves to study,\u201d he says, staring blankly into a corner as if he were remembering a father-daughter moment. He had wanted Hauwau to become a nurse or a doctor. And when he learnt that his daughter and other students would be transferred to another school in town, he heaved a sigh of relief, thankful that she would at least be safe from the prying eyes of bandits. What Muazu did not know was that the next time he would see his daughter, barely a month later, she would be hours away from taking her last breath.\n\n\u201cWhen they called me, I was in Sokoto, the state capital. That was on Tuesday, around 10am. My first son, who also came from Sokoto to Bakale, called me and said the school\u2019s officials just brought my daughter home. I asked, \u2018what was the matter?\u2019 He told me the officials said my daughter was ill and needed home care. I pleaded with them (officials) to help me rush her to our general hospital at Bodinga town,\u201d Muazu tells TheCable.\n\nAnd that was the beginning of Hauwau\u2019s final journey from the earth. Weeks before, she was one of hundreds of students affected by a \u201cmerger\u201d, following a government directive on preventing bandits\u2019 attacks on schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE MERGER \u2014 FOUR WEEKS BEFORE\n\nIn January, the Sokoto government approved the merger of some secondary schools located in border towns in the state. The move was informed by rumours that bandits had infiltrated the state and were planning to attack schools. Nura Maikwanci, spokesperson of the state ministry of basic and secondary education, explained that the students in border towns would be evacuated to schools located in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development saw the merger of Government Girls Unity Secondary School, Bodinga; Gamji Girls College, Rabah, and Government Girls College, Mabera.\n\nOn March 24, weeks after the three schools were formally merged, news broke of a gastrointestinal infection later diagnosed as cholera. While 30 students were initially said to have been affected, the number rose to 70 within 24 hours \u2014 according to the school management. Unfortunately, two students \u2014 Hauwau and another student from GGC Rabah \u2014 would later die of complications arising from the infection.\n\nFollowing the outbreak, the Sokoto government shut down GGC, Mabera, as part of efforts to curtail the spread. Kulu Haruna, the state commissioner for science and technology, had refuted claims that the school operated under unhygienic conditions. She had also explained that no teacher was infected. However, the state\u2019s claims turned out to be a completely different situation when TheCable visited the school. In an environment where dried faeces battled for space with students, and girls slept outside their rooms just to make the cramped condition more bearable, an outbreak was more or less inevitable.\n\nSICK YET MOVED 56KM HOME\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHauwau\u2019s home in Bakale, a village located 56 kilometres from the capital, sits on a quiet, rocky expanse of land. Speaking on the chain of events leading to his daughter\u2019s death, Muazu said he had accepted the incident as God\u2019s will. He, however, wondered why she was brought home rather than taken to a hospital in the city, given her condition.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that the school management brought my daughter to my house, rather than admit her to the nearest hospital,\u201d Muazu said.\n\n\u201cI immediately rushed to the hospital but before I got there, they had left my late daughter on the bed in the ward. I didn\u2019t meet the people (school management) that brought her. They just dropped her and left. But at exactly 6am the next day, Wednesday, she died.\u201d\n\nDespite her condition, Hauwau was reportedly moved in a car \u2014 not an ambulance with first aid \u2014 on a journey that lasted about 90 minutes from her school to her home, even when the school management had ascertained that her health conditioned had worsened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuazu said no government official or member of the school management has contacted him since his daughter\u2019s death.\n\nTEACHER BLAMES OUTBREAK ON STUDENTS\n\nWhen asked why Hauwau was taken home, a teacher at GGC who preferred to remain anonymous, said it is the protocol for a student to be transferred home if the school authority finds the student\u2019s health condition deteriorating.\n\n\u201cWhenever a student is ill, what they do generally is that they look at the condition. If it is what they can handle, they take them to one of the clinics. But when they see that the sickness has become worse, they take the students home. She got it \u2014 I think \u2014 just a day before she died. She wasn\u2019t even one of those who got it first,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on how the outbreak started, the teacher alleged that the students may have deliberately ingested a poisonous substance just so they could take ill and be asked to go home.\n\nHe admitted that there was an outbreak because he also developed symptoms, yet noted that there was the possibility that some of the students feigned illness just to be asked to go home.\n\n\u201cI cannot ascertain exactly what it was. Only health officials can name it. I was also infected. I had stomach ache and small diarrhoea, so I cannot say the outbreak is a lie. Honestly, our students in northern Nigeria here, when they don\u2019t want to study, they can create whatever so that they can go home. They have been doing it over time, only that we cannot exactly say it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome of them have invitation letters for weddings, so they come into the school with the mind that they would go home close to Ramadan. And they are supported by their parents because whenever it is this time, parents put pressure, asking for their daughters to be released. The students of Bodinga Unity School are still here. If really there was a cholera outbreak, why is it not affecting them? They faked it.\u201d\n\nThe teacher then contradicted himself by saying the careless attitude of the students caused the infection to spread fast, affecting a large number of students.\n\n\u201cI used to stay up till night just to stop them from intermingling. We were chasing them back and they were rushing into the isolation centre. It is not up to what people think it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA student was caught making concoction herself to make sure that she also had diarrhoea so as to go to the isolation centre. She was rushed in at past 12am. She mixed some herbs into a small container and drank it. It was her friends that revealed what she did.\n\n\u201cImmediately the school management said they will ask the students to go home so that they could handle the situation, they started jubilating that they were going home. The students, both the sick and healthy ones, mixed up. Even those in the isolation centre rushed out and ran to the hostels to get their belongings, even with cannula on their hands. I was also infected. I had a stomach ache and small diarrhoea, so I cannot say the outbreak is a lie. But some of the nurses came to prove it that some of the students were lying.\u201d\n\nCONTAMINATED WATER, OVERCROWDING, UNHYGIENIC RESTROOMS\u2026 WHAT CAUSED THE OUTBREAK?\n\nAccording to the teacher, a physical assessment of the school\u2019s hostels \u2014 Nana house, Khadijah house, Mariam house, Aisha house, Fatimah house and Amina house \u2014 was carried out and a conclusion was reached that the institution had enough space to accommodate more students from other schools, before the merger was approved.\n\n\u201cIn GGC, we have abundant space and they concluded that it was better we do the merger than for the students to be taken by bandits because Bodinga is porous,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Fatimah, a student of GGC Mabera, said the hostels became overcrowded after the schools were merged. According to her, each room had about 15 additional students, and ventilation was poor, which resulted in some of the students opting to sleep outside at night because of the heat.\n\nWhen told of the teacher\u2019s claim that there was abundant space, she dismissed it, saying, \u201che lied!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used to sleep outside because it was too crowded,\u201d Fatimah added.\n\nFatimah\u2019s sister, a nurse, said she was at work when she learnt of the outbreak. She said she got home in the evening and met Fatimah, who would later take ill, at home.\n\n\u201cWhen she came back home, that evening, we had to treat her with Flagyl, ORS, and antibiotics because she was stooling. She just recovered three days ago. She told us that all of a sudden, students complained of headache, abdominal pain and then collapsed, after which the student will be transferred to the isolation hall, while those with severe symptoms were transferred to the specialist hospital,\u201d Fatimah\u2019s sister said.\n\n\u201cShe got home on Friday and started complaining of abdominal pain. She said she had taken only beverage because she does not even eat school food. That means there was a problem somewhere. Maybe they lack sanitation or because of overcrowding. I know Bodinga, I know how the school was overcrowded, talk more of combining them with GGC.\u201d\n\nWATER SCARCITY\n\nA female teacher, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the school had suffered scarcity of water for some time. She explained that the water supply to the school was cut off after the pipes were broken during construction works to control erosion in Mabera.\n\n\u201cYou know cholera is a water-borne disease. Their environment is just like ours. Seeing outside, you can imagine how inside will be. The problem started with the merger. It made them squeeze and adjust resources and the place became congested,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere has been lack of water in the school because of the gutter for the erosion control in Mabera. The pipes that were connected to the school were broken so they now bring water to them. But recently, maybe because of the population, they connected one pipe for them. There is every tendency that the infection may have come through that bye-construction.\n\n\u201cThe condition of the school is better imagined; it is an eyesore. We feel for the students. Sometimes, I buy sachet water for them just to help them.\u201d\n\nFatimah also decried the poor water condition faced by the students.\n\n\u201cThere is water scarcity in our school. We fetch water from the reservoir and it is not clean,\u201d Fatimah said.\n\nWhen TheCable visited the school and inspected the facilities on April 4, Aisha, one of the students transferred to GGC Mabera from Bodinga, said they were yet to be supplied water that day.\n\n\u201cThe toilet is not good, and the water tastes salty. We fetch water from the taps or from the reservoir. Water is not always available. Even today, we have not had water. When it is 4 o\u2019clock, they\u2019d put on the generator and pump water,\u201d Aisha said.\n\n\u2018SOME DEFECATE INSIDE NYLONS IN THEIR ROOMS\u2019\n\nThe toilets seen by TheCable were all pit toilets. Dried lumps of human faeces littered the area surrounding the toilets. However, a student said Fatimah\u2019s hostel, which is said to have been recently renovated by Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, has flush toilets.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of the restrooms, another student also named Fatimah said the toilets are cleaned once a week, and sometimes without soap or disinfectant.\n\nThe non-availability of running water in the school, the students said, causes them discomfort, hence many opt to defecate in the bush.\n\n\u201cFor the toilet aspect, we should leave that one, because there\u2019s no water and it\u2019s per week that we sometimes wash the toilet. We wash it with ordinary water and sometimes with just detergent. Some girls do defecate inside nylons in their rooms,\u201d one of the students, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said.\n\n\u201cBefore they brought the other students, some rooms had 20 students while some had about 10 to 12. But now, seriously, even we here are not finding it okay, because in a common room we are now about 28 to 30 living together.\n\n\u201cWe used to drink water from the pump before but the pump got damaged. The water is not clear. It is a motor tank that sometimes brings the water and sometimes, it\u2019s the same bucket that we use for bathing that we use to store drinking water.\u201d\n\nOPEN DEFECATION AT \u2018CORDELIA\u2019\n\nAisha, another student, corroborated Fatima\u2019s narrative about the practice of open defecation among the students.\n\nAccording to her, there is a site within the hostel environment nicknamed \u2018Cordelia\u2019 where students defecate \u201canyhow\u201d. She suspects that the outbreak may have been triggered there.\n\nHowever, the male teacher said the practice of open defecation by the students is a matter of choice, and not owing to the condition of the restrooms.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of preference; that is why some students don\u2019t use the toilet. They want to go out just as they do it in their villages,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), over 40 million Nigerians still practice open defecation.\n\nSUFFERING AND SERVING\n\nThe corps members posted to GGC Mabera for the compulsory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme are not having it any better.\n\nLike the students, the four corps members had to resort to bathing in the open space beside their lodge and taking advantage of a broken sewage pipe as toilet. This, they did because of the sorry state of the restrooms in their lodge.\n\nSCHOOL MANAGEMENT IS \u2018HELPLESS\u2019\n\nWhen contacted for comments, a senior management official of GGC Mabera, who didn\u2019t want to be named, told TheCable that the school management can\u2019t do much to improve the situation.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the students eat with the bowls they take to the toilet. That is what I think caused the cholera. Also, the students from Bodinga used to \u2018shit\u2019 (defecate) anyhow in the hostel,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what measures are in place to prevent another outbreak when the school resumes, he said: \u201cAs school management, we don\u2019t have any power to make them go back to their schools, except the government decides to because they are the ones who merged them.\u201d\n\nEfforts to speak to Muhammed Inname, the state commissioner for health, proved abortive as he neither picked calls placed to him nor responded to messages.\n\nAfter several efforts to reach Kulu Haruna, the state commissioner for science and technology, to react to the issue, she simply said it had been \u201covertaken by events\u201d.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation. Published materials are not views of the MacArthur Foundation",

          "title": "INSIDE STORY: Open defecation, water scarcity... how Sokoto students succumbed to cholera",
          "text": "12:31pm. It\u2019s a sultry Friday afternoon. Lean and tall but with a steady gait, Mustapha Muazu leads TheCable into his home. With a smile spread across his sorrow-induced sunken cheeks, he sits on a mat in his living room \u2014 a space that his \u201cfuture of medicine\u201d used to play and study. He speaks of how, with Hauwau, his daughter who was a student of Government Girls Unity Secondary School in Bodinga LGA of Sokoto state, he wanted to break the jinx of child marriage in the north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe loves to study,\u201d he says, staring blankly into a corner as if he were remembering a father-daughter moment. He had wanted Hauwau to become a nurse or a doctor. And when he learnt that his daughter and other students would be transferred to another school in town, he heaved a sigh of relief, thankful that she would at least be safe from the prying eyes of bandits. What Muazu did not know was that the next time he would see his daughter, barely a month later, she would be hours away from taking her last breath.\n\n\u201cWhen they called me, I was in Sokoto, the state capital. That was on Tuesday, around 10am. My first son, who also came from Sokoto to Bakale, called me and said the school\u2019s officials just brought my daughter home. I asked, \u2018what was the matter?\u2019 He told me the officials said my daughter was ill and needed home care. I pleaded with them (officials) to help me rush her to our general hospital at Bodinga town,\u201d Muazu tells TheCable.\n\nAnd that was the beginning of Hauwau\u2019s final journey from the earth. Weeks before, she was one of hundreds of students affected by a \u201cmerger\u201d, following a government directive on preventing bandits\u2019 attacks on schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE MERGER \u2014 FOUR WEEKS BEFORE\n\nIn January, the Sokoto government approved the merger of some secondary schools located in border towns in the state. The move was informed by rumours that bandits had infiltrated the state and were planning to attack schools. Nura Maikwanci, spokesperson of the state ministry of basic and secondary education, explained that the students in border towns would be evacuated to schools located in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe development saw the merger of Government Girls Unity Secondary School, Bodinga; Gamji Girls College, Rabah, and Government Girls College, Mabera.\n\nOn March 24, weeks after the three schools were formally merged, news broke of a gastrointestinal infection later diagnosed as cholera. While 30 students were initially said to have been affected, the number rose to 70 within 24 hours \u2014 according to the school management. Unfortunately, two students \u2014 Hauwau and another student from GGC Rabah \u2014 would later die of complications arising from the infection.\n\nFollowing the outbreak, the Sokoto government shut down GGC, Mabera, as part of efforts to curtail the spread. Kulu Haruna, the state commissioner for science and technology, had refuted claims that the school operated under unhygienic conditions. She had also explained that no teacher was infected. However, the state\u2019s claims turned out to be a completely different situation when TheCable visited the school. In an environment where dried faeces battled for space with students, and girls slept outside their rooms just to make the cramped condition more bearable, an outbreak was more or less inevitable.\n\nSICK YET MOVED 56KM HOME\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHauwau\u2019s home in Bakale, a village located 56 kilometres from the capital, sits on a quiet, rocky expanse of land. Speaking on the chain of events leading to his daughter\u2019s death, Muazu said he had accepted the incident as God\u2019s will. He, however, wondered why she was brought home rather than taken to a hospital in the city, given her condition.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that the school management brought my daughter to my house, rather than admit her to the nearest hospital,\u201d Muazu said.\n\n\u201cI immediately rushed to the hospital but before I got there, they had left my late daughter on the bed in the ward. I didn\u2019t meet the people (school management) that brought her. They just dropped her and left. But at exactly 6am the next day, Wednesday, she died.\u201d\n\nDespite her condition, Hauwau was reportedly moved in a car \u2014 not an ambulance with first aid \u2014 on a journey that lasted about 90 minutes from her school to her home, even when the school management had ascertained that her health conditioned had worsened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuazu said no government official or member of the school management has contacted him since his daughter\u2019s death.\n\nTEACHER BLAMES OUTBREAK ON STUDENTS\n\nWhen asked why Hauwau was taken home, a teacher at GGC who preferred to remain anonymous, said it is the protocol for a student to be transferred home if the school authority finds the student\u2019s health condition deteriorating.\n\n\u201cWhenever a student is ill, what they do generally is that they look at the condition. If it is what they can handle, they take them to one of the clinics. But when they see that the sickness has become worse, they take the students home. She got it \u2014 I think \u2014 just a day before she died. She wasn\u2019t even one of those who got it first,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on how the outbreak started, the teacher alleged that the students may have deliberately ingested a poisonous substance just so they could take ill and be asked to go home.\n\nHe admitted that there was an outbreak because he also developed symptoms, yet noted that there was the possibility that some of the students feigned illness just to be asked to go home.\n\n\u201cI cannot ascertain exactly what it was. Only health officials can name it. I was also infected. I had stomach ache and small diarrhoea, so I cannot say the outbreak is a lie. Honestly, our students in northern Nigeria here, when they don\u2019t want to study, they can create whatever so that they can go home. They have been doing it over time, only that we cannot exactly say it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome of them have invitation letters for weddings, so they come into the school with the mind that they would go home close to Ramadan. And they are supported by their parents because whenever it is this time, parents put pressure, asking for their daughters to be released. The students of Bodinga Unity School are still here. If really there was a cholera outbreak, why is it not affecting them? They faked it.\u201d\n\nThe teacher then contradicted himself by saying the careless attitude of the students caused the infection to spread fast, affecting a large number of students.\n\n\u201cI used to stay up till night just to stop them from intermingling. We were chasing them back and they were rushing into the isolation centre. It is not up to what people think it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA student was caught making concoction herself to make sure that she also had diarrhoea so as to go to the isolation centre. She was rushed in at past 12am. She mixed some herbs into a small container and drank it. It was her friends that revealed what she did.\n\n\u201cImmediately the school management said they will ask the students to go home so that they could handle the situation, they started jubilating that they were going home. The students, both the sick and healthy ones, mixed up. Even those in the isolation centre rushed out and ran to the hostels to get their belongings, even with cannula on their hands. I was also infected. I had a stomach ache and small diarrhoea, so I cannot say the outbreak is a lie. But some of the nurses came to prove it that some of the students were lying.\u201d\n\nCONTAMINATED WATER, OVERCROWDING, UNHYGIENIC RESTROOMS\u2026 WHAT CAUSED THE OUTBREAK?\n\nAccording to the teacher, a physical assessment of the school\u2019s hostels \u2014 Nana house, Khadijah house, Mariam house, Aisha house, Fatimah house and Amina house \u2014 was carried out and a conclusion was reached that the institution had enough space to accommodate more students from other schools, before the merger was approved.\n\n\u201cIn GGC, we have abundant space and they concluded that it was better we do the merger than for the students to be taken by bandits because Bodinga is porous,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Fatimah, a student of GGC Mabera, said the hostels became overcrowded after the schools were merged. According to her, each room had about 15 additional students, and ventilation was poor, which resulted in some of the students opting to sleep outside at night because of the heat.\n\nWhen told of the teacher\u2019s claim that there was abundant space, she dismissed it, saying, \u201che lied!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used to sleep outside because it was too crowded,\u201d Fatimah added.\n\nFatimah\u2019s sister, a nurse, said she was at work when she learnt of the outbreak. She said she got home in the evening and met Fatimah, who would later take ill, at home.\n\n\u201cWhen she came back home, that evening, we had to treat her with Flagyl, ORS, and antibiotics because she was stooling. She just recovered three days ago. She told us that all of a sudden, students complained of headache, abdominal pain and then collapsed, after which the student will be transferred to the isolation hall, while those with severe symptoms were transferred to the specialist hospital,\u201d Fatimah\u2019s sister said.\n\n\u201cShe got home on Friday and started complaining of abdominal pain. She said she had taken only beverage because she does not even eat school food. That means there was a problem somewhere. Maybe they lack sanitation or because of overcrowding. I know Bodinga, I know how the school was overcrowded, talk more of combining them with GGC.\u201d\n\nWATER SCARCITY\n\nA female teacher, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the school had suffered scarcity of water for some time. She explained that the water supply to the school was cut off after the pipes were broken during construction works to control erosion in Mabera.\n\n\u201cYou know cholera is a water-borne disease. Their environment is just like ours. Seeing outside, you can imagine how inside will be. The problem started with the merger. It made them squeeze and adjust resources and the place became congested,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere has been lack of water in the school because of the gutter for the erosion control in Mabera. The pipes that were connected to the school were broken so they now bring water to them. But recently, maybe because of the population, they connected one pipe for them. There is every tendency that the infection may have come through that bye-construction.\n\n\u201cThe condition of the school is better imagined; it is an eyesore. We feel for the students. Sometimes, I buy sachet water for them just to help them.\u201d\n\nFatimah also decried the poor water condition faced by the students.\n\n\u201cThere is water scarcity in our school. We fetch water from the reservoir and it is not clean,\u201d Fatimah said.\n\nWhen TheCable visited the school and inspected the facilities on April 4, Aisha, one of the students transferred to GGC Mabera from Bodinga, said they were yet to be supplied water that day.\n\n\u201cThe toilet is not good, and the water tastes salty. We fetch water from the taps or from the reservoir. Water is not always available. Even today, we have not had water. When it is 4 o\u2019clock, they\u2019d put on the generator and pump water,\u201d Aisha said.\n\n\u2018SOME DEFECATE INSIDE NYLONS IN THEIR ROOMS\u2019\n\nThe toilets seen by TheCable were all pit toilets. Dried lumps of human faeces littered the area surrounding the toilets. However, a student said Fatimah\u2019s hostel, which is said to have been recently renovated by Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, has flush toilets.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of the restrooms, another student also named Fatimah said the toilets are cleaned once a week, and sometimes without soap or disinfectant.\n\nThe non-availability of running water in the school, the students said, causes them discomfort, hence many opt to defecate in the bush.\n\n\u201cFor the toilet aspect, we should leave that one, because there\u2019s no water and it\u2019s per week that we sometimes wash the toilet. We wash it with ordinary water and sometimes with just detergent. Some girls do defecate inside nylons in their rooms,\u201d one of the students, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said.\n\n\u201cBefore they brought the other students, some rooms had 20 students while some had about 10 to 12. But now, seriously, even we here are not finding it okay, because in a common room we are now about 28 to 30 living together.\n\n\u201cWe used to drink water from the pump before but the pump got damaged. The water is not clear. It is a motor tank that sometimes brings the water and sometimes, it\u2019s the same bucket that we use for bathing that we use to store drinking water.\u201d\n\nOPEN DEFECATION AT \u2018CORDELIA\u2019\n\nAisha, another student, corroborated Fatima\u2019s narrative about the practice of open defecation among the students.\n\nAccording to her, there is a site within the hostel environment nicknamed \u2018Cordelia\u2019 where students defecate \u201canyhow\u201d. She suspects that the outbreak may have been triggered there.\n\nHowever, the male teacher said the practice of open defecation by the students is a matter of choice, and not owing to the condition of the restrooms.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of preference; that is why some students don\u2019t use the toilet. They want to go out just as they do it in their villages,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), over 40 million Nigerians still practice open defecation.\n\nSUFFERING AND SERVING\n\nThe corps members posted to GGC Mabera for the compulsory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme are not having it any better.\n\nLike the students, the four corps members had to resort to bathing in the open space beside their lodge and taking advantage of a broken sewage pipe as toilet. This, they did because of the sorry state of the restrooms in their lodge.\n\nSCHOOL MANAGEMENT IS \u2018HELPLESS\u2019\n\nWhen contacted for comments, a senior management official of GGC Mabera, who didn\u2019t want to be named, told TheCable that the school management can\u2019t do much to improve the situation.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the students eat with the bowls they take to the toilet. That is what I think caused the cholera. Also, the students from Bodinga used to \u2018shit\u2019 (defecate) anyhow in the hostel,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what measures are in place to prevent another outbreak when the school resumes, he said: \u201cAs school management, we don\u2019t have any power to make them go back to their schools, except the government decides to because they are the ones who merged them.\u201d\n\nEfforts to speak to Muhammed Inname, the state commissioner for health, proved abortive as he neither picked calls placed to him nor responded to messages.\n\nAfter several efforts to reach Kulu Haruna, the state commissioner for science and technology, to react to the issue, she simply said it had been \u201covertaken by events\u201d.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation. Published materials are not views of the MacArthur Foundation",
          "summary": "While 30 students were initially said to have been affected, the number rose to 70 within 24 hours \u2014 according to the school management.\n\u201cI was surprised that the school management brought my daughter to my house, rather than admit her to the nearest hospital,\u201d Muazu said.\nAdvertisementMuazu said no government official or member of the school management has contacted him since his daughter\u2019s death.\nSometimes, I buy sachet water for them just to help them.\u201dFatimah also decried the poor water condition faced by the students.\nSCHOOL MANAGEMENT IS \u2018HELPLESS\u2019When contacted for comments, a senior management official of GGC Mabera, who didn\u2019t want to be named, told TheCable that the school management can\u2019t do much to improve the situation.",

          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome? We are also asking the same questions.\n\n* Not real name\n\nFeatured Image by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care?

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChildren are wonderful gifts to their parents and are treasured, catered for and trained, equipping them with the basic needs and characters to face the challenges of life with the hope that they become great leaders of tomorrow to pilot the affairs of the society, states, nation and the world at large.\n\nFollowing the recognition of the role played by children in each family and the need to celebrate and make them feel loved and important, preparing them for leadership positions in future, a day was set aside for them.\n\nA day was set aside to celebrate children, and that day is \u201cCHILDREN\u2019S DAY\u201d. May 27 is traditionally the children\u2019s holiday in Nigeria, a day to celebrate the children.\n\nChildren\u2019s Day began in 1857 by Reverend Dr Charles Leonard in Chelsea, US. Even though Children\u2019s Day is celebrated globally by most of the countries in the world on June 1st, Universal Children\u2019s Day takes place annually on November 20th.\n\nChildren\u2019s Day is a commemorative date celebrated annually in honor of children, whose date of observance varies by countries as the international Children\u2019s Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare in 1952. While United Nations first established the day in 1964, the day remains important in the lives of many Nigerian kids.\n\nIt is a national day to celebrate the importance of children and the day provides policymakers and families with an opportunity to consider the personal development of young Nigerians.\n\nIt is a public holiday for Primary and Secondary school children. Due to the large size of the country, only a few groups of children (schools or other organizations) are selected to participate in march past parade as organised by various states across the federation. The ravaging COVID 19 pandemic has even slowed down the celebration as large crowd is prohibited to check the spread.\n\nOn May 27th every year, children are granted a holiday while several social activities are centred on them. Excused from school, most kids converge at stadiums and centres to commemorate the event. COVID 19 however has changed the way its been celebrated across the globe.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s led administration places great premium on the lives of Edo children, preparing them for leadership positions in the state, country and world at large. Flowing from this, the governor introduced Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) programme to lay a good foundation for them.\n\nEDOBEST, is a programme organised to catch the kids young at the basic level educationally with the use of technology in learning. This programme is chaired by a committed, dedicated, selfless, and hardworking Edo woman and the Chairman Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe. Under her dynamic leadership, Edo children have benefited greatly from EDOBEST. They can now read, write, do arithmetic correctly. Most striking is that even primary one pupils in public schools across Edo State are now able to read books meant for their age category.\n\nTo ensure that learning does not just end in the classroom, SUBEB decided to key into 2021 celebration to show and express how important Edo children are to the Obaseki\u2019s administration.\n\nThe children\u2019s day celebration was held across the 18 Local Government Area of Edo State with various activities to spice up the day for the children and make it memorable. Children in Edo South, Edo Central and Edo North were all captured in the celebration galore, thanks to the foresight of Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe.\n\nThe 2021 Children\u2019s Day celebration with the theme: \u201cUnite to reverse the impacts of COVID 19 Pandemic on children,\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari celebrated the Day with a solemn promise to bequeath a better country for the present and future generations. He described children as precious blessings that should be nurtured to carry the burden of the society in the future.\n\nIn a message to celebrate Edo children, Governor Godwin Obaseki assured that his administration will sustain ongoing reforms to strengthen public institutions to guarantee a sustainable future for Edo children. He added that his administration will continue to implement policy reforms to benefit children in the state. \u201cI am delighted to mark this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Day and celebrate our children, who are the future of Edo State and Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe said Edo children were beneficiaries of very pragmatic reforms that the administration have undertaken in the education sector over the past four years.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed fulfilling that we can see the evidence of the huge investment made in transforming the way our children learn, which is manifest in the outcomes from our basic education sector.\u201d\n\nEdo pupils across the 18 Local Government Area were very much involved in this year\u2019s celebration as SUBEB and Edo State Government engaged them in various activities despite restrictions necessitated by coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUnlike previous celebration held in Benin, the Executive Chairman of SUBEB Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe said the celebration was discentralised in 2019 to ensure children participate across the three senatorial districts. She explained that the COVID 19 pandemic led to SUBEB taking it a step further by organising \u201cmicro children\u2019s day\u201d celebration across the 18 LGA. She noted that a major highlight for the 2021 celebration was launch of \u201cEvery Child a Reading Champion\u201d literacy campaign.\n\n\u201cAs part of the 2021 celebration, we have launched \u2018Every Child a Reading Champion Literacy campaign\u2019. The aim is for our children leaving primary school to know how to read. When leaving primary six our pupils will be able to read fluently and also can author a book. That is the standard we are setting for ourselves. We are also rolling out classroom library where each child take turn to become the class liberian.\n\n\u201cSince 2018 when EDOBEST was launched, over seven million textbooks and instructional materials have been distributed to schools across the State. For the 2021 celebration, we have distributed over 40,000 books and instructional materials.\n\nFrom Ehor in Uhunmwode, Abudu in Orihiomwon, Idogbo in Ikpoba-Okha to Uselu in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State, it was all celebration and fun for the children. Moving to Etsako West in Edo North, Ubiaja in Esan South East, the stories were not different, it was a day to celebrate Edo children.\n\nIn Ehor, Abudu and Idogbo children engaged in match past, poem recitations, football game, cultural display by participating schools. Even pupils from far Central and North did not need to come to Benin City to be part of it the excitement. Edo pupils were celebrated in Ekpoma, Ubiaja, Auchi and other designated locations for the event across the 18 LGA.\n\nIn Ehor, the focus was on parents. They were urged to inculcate fear of God into their children as they mark the day in Uhunmwode Local Government Area. A teacher, Mr Ohenhen Johnson, of Uwa Model Primary school in Uhunmwode local government area, said that it was necessary for all parents and guardians to inculcate fear of God into their children and wards.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe children are the future leaders, so parents must not fail in this direction, our responsibilities goes beyond just housing, feeding and providing shelter for them\u201d.\n\nAnother teacher, Mrs. Francisca Eze of Victory Primary School in Ehor, called on government at all levels to keep investing in the educational sector, adding that education is key to the development and success of the country.\n\nEze said that parents also should keep assisting their children while at home and ensure they bring them up in God\u2019s way.\n\nIn Abudu the administrative headquarters of Orihiomwon Local Government Area of Edo State, the Head of Local Government Administration (HOLGA) and acting Chairman of the council, Dr. Francis Odigie was on ground to celebrate with the children as he mounted the podium to recieve salute from the over 10 schools that participated in a match past at the council secretariat, venue for the event.\n\nHe said children should be celebrated as the leaders of tommorow. He lauded the Governor Godwin Obaseki led administration for creating the platform for children of the state to have access to basic education through the establishment of EDOBEST which has introduced technology to learning.\n\nThe Education Secretary of the council Aghedo Gideon expressed joy for this celebration saying the children has never had it so good. He emphasized that the collaboration between SUBEB and Edo State Government has improved the education system in Edo State.\n\nIn Auchi Edo North, SUBEB focused its celebration on achieving global standard literacy, numeracy skills in the state. It challenged leaders and parents to equip children to enable them compete globally and emerge employable in the digital age and age to come.\n\n\u201cAll the children of Edo represent our future, and we owe it to ourselves and our children to invest wisely and build the right institutions, system and processes\u201d.\n\nMrs. Joy Ojobor who represented the SUBEB Chairman said launching a campaign to make every child in the state a \u201cReading Champion\u201d is to encourage the culture of reading among children of the state.\n\n\u201cThe ability to read is the key that unlocks vast knowledge and capacity that is responsible for shaping a secured future\u201d.\n\nAt Ubiaja and other locations across other four local government area of Esan Central senatorial District, the celebration continued with match past, cultural displays and other activities. EDSG in collaboration with SUBEB also restated its commitment to increase school enrollment in both primary and secondary schools in the State.\n\nParents were urged not to discourage children from attending classes as the governor remained committed in its efforts to direct resources towards the education and welfare of all Edo children. The parents were told that Edo state continues to lead with the lowest number of \u201cout of school children\u201d in the the country.\n\nAcross the 18 Local Government Area of Edo State, on a day meant for them, children expressed their happiness and readiness to step in to leadership positions to pilot the affairs of the State. Some pupils of Uwa Model Primary School, Ikhuenerio including Victory Egberanmwen and Perpetual Osaretin could not hide their joy.\n\nAccording to Victory, \u201cI feel so happy to be here to compete and have fun with other pupils. I thank the governor for EDOBEST which has made my school look so beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will like to thank Governor Obaseki for the gift of books, I feel so excited to be part of this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Day celebration,\u201d Perpetual said.\n\nThis is the first children\u2019s day since the outbreak of Coronavirus and looking at it now, it shows that we are overcoming the COVID, as education stakeholders were all happy that Children\u2019s Day celebration held in 2021.\n\nThe stakeholders also expressed hope that with the launch of \u201cEvery Child a Reading Champion\u201d during the 2021 children\u2019s day in Edo State, the dividends will soon be realized in pupils as they would become not only fluent readers but champions in all aspects of academic disciplines.\n\n...",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe latest attempt by the Nigerian senate to amend the country\u2019s discredited 1999 constitution, which started last year, amid heightening insecurity and economic troubles threatening to collapse Africa\u2019s most populous country, got to a critical point last week.\n\nThe lawmakers held their two-day zonal public hearing in 12 centres across the six geopolitical zones of the country on Wednesday and Thursday. As would have been expected in a diverse polity like Nigeria\u2019s, the outcomes proved different. In the country\u2019s Northeast, Borno and Yobe states kicked against state police, while their Bauchi counterpart, sought its establishment.\n\nState police, like devolution of powers, has been one of the thorny issues of the Nigerian federation. It\u2019s been historically opposed by the country\u2019s more conservative North. But as insecurity escalates, threatening the continued existence of the country as a stable, united polity, opinions are shifting considerably.\n\nIn Kaduna, Northwest region\u2019s political capital which has continued to witness incessant attacks by bandits, the state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, did not mince words.\n\nFor him, the reality of the security situation requires, not only that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies, but must also decentralise the police to enable the states exercise effective control in securing residents and communities.\n\nThe Kaduna governor went on to make a strong case for power devolution, a pointer to the shifting opinions in the country\u2019s North.\n\nBut even so, skepticism abound. Many argue that, like in previous attempts at amending the constitution, the latest exercise will end in futility. For them, therefore, only an entirely new constitution will do.\n\nOn Sunday, Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) at its meeting in Abuja, presided over by Edwin Clark, its national leader, described the review as fraudulent, arguing that the only way to avert the death of Nigeria is to restructure.\n\nMany opinion leaders have expressed the view that the venture cannot deliver needed reforms, even as the country\u2019s slips rapidly into anarchy.\n\n\u201cThe entrenched interests will not allow for the real issues to be tackled,\u201d said Monday Ubani, former vice president of the Nigerian Bar Association and Principal Partner of Ubani & Co.\n\n\u201cTake the issue of creation of state, for example. Giving the Southeast one additional state is something that ought to be supported without much ado, but you know the politics of Nigeria. But if we really want to run a federation based on justice, equity and fair play, these are the kinds of things that should be done.\u201d\n\nUbani believes that the ongoing effort will end up scratching the surface, which, according to him, is still better than nothing. He is, however, hopeful that given the current security situation, nobody in his right mind will oppose state police.\n\n\u201cConsidering the level of insecurity we have in the country now, I don\u2019t think anybody in his right sense will oppose the creation of state police,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t want state police can still rely on federal police. It\u2019s only two states, Borno and Yobe that have said no, out of the 36 states, so they are in the minority. Those who want state police should be given state police, but those who don\u2019t can rely on federal police.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is as optimistic that as much as state police can be achieved, however. The 1999 Constitution had been hurriedly put together by the General Abdulsalami Abubakar regime in 1998 in anticipation of the return to civilian rule in 1999.\n\nThe outcome turned out to be what many have described as a unitary constitution in a country that prides itself as a federation. One of the key anomalies is the police force, which is controlled by the central government contrary to what is obtained in an ideal federation.\n\nThe anomaly so birthed has continued to cause friction. But it has tended to favour the country\u2019s North, which has dominated power since independence. The region has staunchly resisted agitations by other groups to return to a true federation, where each region/state has control of own resources, law enforcement, among others.\n\nA number of similar attempts made at amending a constitution ended up, at best, achieving piecemeal alterations, while the real issues such as devolution of powers and state police, often encapsulated in the term restructuring, failed to scale through on account of entrenched political interests.\n\nThe last time out, the items were voted down in the Senate with senators from the conservative north overwhelmingly rejecting the idea of power devolution. Observers say, nothing is likely to change without a new constitution.\n\n\u201cThe current Constitutional amendment is an exercise in futility; it only buys time to maintain the failed status quo. Only true federalism can truly save Nigeria,\u201d argued Lagos based lawyer and political analyst, Mr. Chima Nnaji.\n\nLike Nnaji, many have remained skeptical about the amendment delivering any tangible alterations to the status quo. Ideally constitutional amendment in Nigeria is a rigorous process, requiring the buy-in of two-thirds majority for any major issue to pass, a tough call in a country deeply divided along tribal and religious lines, and where entrenched political interests are profound.\n\nAs hinted earlier, previous attempts had ended achieving little or nothing, after gulping huge sums of money. In 2007, the sum of N1billion was practically frittered away on a constitutional amendment drive led by ad-hoc committees of the Senate and House of Representatives in 2007, under the chairmanship of former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ibrahim Mantu and Deputy Speaker, Hon. Austin Okpara. It turned out to be a futile exercise.\n\nAnother attempt to review the constitution by the seventh assembly (2011 \u2013 2015) cost the country another N1billion, this time under the chairmanship of then Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, and then Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Usman Bayero Nafada.\n\nYet, in the eight assembly (2015 \u2013 2019), another attempt spearheaded by Ekweremadu, gulped an estimated N4billion, and after all the hard work done by the committee, Nigerians watched as every single important item aimed at devolving power to the states, was voted down on the floor of the red chamber.\n\nAll the effort from 2007 till date, only managed to achieve such minor amendments as altering Sections 145 and 190 of the Constitution to compel the President/Governor to transmit a letter to the National Assembly/State Assembly to enable their deputies act whenever they are to proceed on vacation or unable to discharge their functions, failure of which the Vice President or Deputy Governor automatically assumes office in acting capacity after 21 days and amendments to enable a person sworn in as President or Governor to complete the term of an elected President or Governor, but disqualified from election to the same office for more than one more term.\n\nAnother was to make the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u201ctruly\u201d independent. Sections 81, 84, and 160 of the Constitution came to grant INEC financial and administrative autonomy, but recent elections have shown that the attempt did little to change the working of the electoral body.\n\nThe Constitution was also amended to grant financial autonomy to the National Assembly to make it more independent and promote checks and balance, a measure that was also extended to state legislatures and State Judiciary, but many say the assemblies have become even more appendages of the executive.\n\n\u201cThe present national assembly is the weakest since we started out democracy,\u201d Ubani said. \u201cThis is an assembly that is too subservient to the executive. It doesn\u2019t even understand its independence; it acts like its an appendage of the executive, courtesy of its current leadership, Ahmad Lawan as senate president and Femi Gbajabiamila as the speaker of the house. They are just dancing to the tune of the president.\u201d\n\nAt the end of all the efforts in the past, the elaborate amendments such devolution of power by re-organising the legislative lists to move railway, aviation, power, stamp duty etc. from exclusive list to concurrent list, and creation of state police, failed to scale through, which meant that the key issues remained, and the latest effort led by the current deputy senate president, Ovie Omo Agege, is yet another attempt to try to achieve what could not be achieved in previous attempts; an effort some argue is unlikely to turn out differently.\n\n\u201cYou are asking the beneficiary of an injustice to fight the injustice,\u201d said lawyer and activist, Dele Farotimi. \u201cIt is not surprising that they too are asking for a review, it\u2019s almost impossible to ask them to remove the chair from under their own butt.\n\nBut lets be clear, there has to be a radical departure from this cosmetic discussion about a review because any review that doesn\u2019t deliver a substantial restructuring of the Nigerian federation, and return the country to true federation, is a waste of time because the agitations will not stop.\n\n\u201cIf we are talking about the legality of the review, yes, the national assembly has the power to review, but can you review in a fraud? So, a new constitutional making process has to be initiated in order to resolve these problems.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a view shared by veteran lawyer and educationist, Chief Afe Babalola, who, last week described the exercise as a waste of time and energy.\n\nBabalola argued, while speaking in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday, that the National Assembly should move for a national conference where issues bedeviling the nation could be identified, discussed and resolved through a roundtable talk, even as the last national conference held under President Goodluck Jonathan is currently gathering dust.\n\nAccording to Babalola who had volunteered to host and bankroll a national dialogue that would aggregate the views if well meaning Nigerians on how to resolve the myriad of problems facing the country, there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 Constitution to cure the inherent defects, if the fraud in the system is not first gotten rid of.\n\nAgainst the background of the massive demand by Nigerians, home and abroad, for a true federal constitution made by the people and for the people, the National Assembly is calling for Public Hearing in the countrys six Geo-political Zones for peoples inputs on any issue of interest to enable the National Assembly to amend the 1999 constitution, he said.\n\nIt is common knowledge that the 1999 Constitution was made by the Military which in its wisdom claimed that it was made by the people.\n\nSecondly, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 Constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President. Or can we, by way of amendment, change the judicial powers of the President under the 1999 Constitution?\n\nThe root cause of our problems, which has brought Nigeria to the brink of extinction, is the 1999 Constitution foisted on it by the Military when it was exiting the reign of governance in 1999.\n\nThe fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become and Iroko tree which has branches. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound round the Presidential system of government.\n\nWhy then is the National Assembly afraid of calling a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution and come up with a Parliamentary system of government like we had in 1963?\u201d he wondered.\n\nThe elder statesman is not alone. Indeed, he had only re-echoed the view of many interest and sociopolitical groups across the country\u2019s south, middle belt and progressive elements in the core-North; who have been agitating for a more far-reaching restructuring to be achieved via a national dialogue.\n\nThe point was made by a number of governors, notably, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, who, while speaking to the senate sub-committee on the proposed amendment, insisted that only a fresh constitution would resolve the issues of the federation.\n\nSpeaking when he received on a courtesy visit, the committee led by Senator James Manager at Government House, Asaba, Okowa called for the insertion of a clause to allow for the re-writing of the constitution while it would continue to be in operation until a new one was ready.\n\nWe know that some amendments were made recently but on a general note, we are also aware that the Constitution itself appears to have just been hurriedly put up just before the 1999 elections and handed over,\u201d he said.\n\nI wished it was possible to start the whole process again and to re-write the Constitution and also believe that there may be a need for us to look very closely on ways and means of re-writing the Constitution as a new document even when the current Constitution exists, Okowa said\n\nIn his part, Akeredolu told members of the Committee in Akure that a national dialogue was the way forward.\n\nI kept making a case anytime I have the opportunity. My circumstance cannot make me believe in secession. My wife is from the South East. My sons married from other regions outside the South West. But strong points have been made. Everybody wants to see fairness and federalism.\n\nThose are the areas: is this how to run a federal government? Is it an inclusive one? How do we have fair representation? People are worried,\u201d Akeredolu told the committee led by Deputy Senate Majority Leader and Senator representing Ondo North Senatorial district, Prof. Ajayi Borrofice.\n\n\u201cThis constitution review, your efforts, I pray it should be accepted. Our people believe that there must be dialogue. People are saying we want national dialogue. How we convoke it, I dont know. I believe those are issues we must look at,\u201d he noted.\n\nOther Governors Speak\n\nWhile declaring open the zonal public hearing in Enugu, for Enugu, Anambra and Ebonyi States, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State said his administration supports amendments in the constitution of Nigeria that will enhance the nations unity and prosperity in an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Gombe, the State Governor, Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya said the evolvement dynamics of the Nigerian state makes it imperative for a periodic constitutional review to accommodate new realities and the concerns of the Nigerian people across board.\n\nIn Imo, Governor Hope Uzodinma encouraged the Igbo to actively participate in the process, noting that their goal of having an additional state in the South East can only be achieved peacefully and urged them to toe the line of peace.\n\nAccording to him, the review process would provide a great opportunity for the society to make inputs into the creation of an acceptable constitution.",

          "title": "State of the states: Borno battles terror odds",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s North Eastern State of Borno has, over the past decade, been that of terror and anarchy and death, one that the reported death of Abubakar Shekau, successor to Mohammed Yusuf, founding leader of Boko Haram terrorist group, will do little to change.\n\nFor over a decade, the Shekau led Boko Haram terrorist group has made life unlivable for millions in Nigeria\u2019s Northeast region and beyond, but particularly in Borno, the headquarters of a bloody insurgency that started in 2009 after Yusuf, the original founder was killed under controversial circumstances.\n\nShekau, his successor, started what has become a full blown war against the Nigerian state in his bid to establish an Islamic caliphate. The group has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced over two million thus far, even as there is yet no end in sight.\n\nLast week, Shekau was reported to have died after blowing himself up with his suicide vest, a report that sources have confirmed to our correspondent to be factual. While the death would have come as a relief to the government and the terrorised populace of Borno, the circumstances surrounding same suggest that it is not particularly good news. It has been down to ideological differences.\n\nFighters of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) who conquered the once invincible Shekau are perhaps even a more formidable force to contend with, have been pushing for acceptability among the civilian population in the North East, and therefore, a bigger threat to Nigeria\u2019s already stretched Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cISWA has become the much stronger and better organized of the two factions. It trumpets its ties to the Islamic State (IS) group and cooperates with other jihadi groups under the IS umbrella active in the Sahel. ISWA could well absorb Shekau\u2019s jihadi fighters,\u201d noted former United States ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell.\n\n\u201cNigeria Shekau\u2019s faction appeared focused on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin while ISWA has looked further beyond its borders. If ISWA is able to establish dominance over the various jihadi factions across the Sahel, it will become more formidable than Shekau\u2019s faction was and a greater threat to the fragile states in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nShekau\u2019s leadership had, for nearly a decade been unchallenged. He was said to have received a letter from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb around 2011 giving him advice to end attacks on Mosques which he failed to heed. In 2012 a faction of the group broke off to form Jamaat Ansar al-Muslimin fi Bil\u0101d as-Sudn (Ansaru).\n\nThe new faction had included his military commander Abu Muhammad al-Bauchawi and religious advisor Sheikh Abu Osama al-Ansari Muhammad Awal al-Gombawi. However, his force remained largely intact, and Shekau engaged in conflict with Ansaru, killing their leader Abu Osama al-Ansari. As a result of this, and other arrests of Ansaru leaders by the Nigerian government, Ansaru did not pose a further threat to Shekau\u2019s leadership of the jihadi movement in Nigeria, and the group became defunct by 2015.\n\nWith the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), he was pressured by his commanders and soldiers to pledge his allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which he eventually did in 2015. Following the allegiance, response came back with the Caliph making him Wali (Governor of the province).\n\nIn a report from the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, Shekau swore allegiance to al-Baghdadi on March 7, 2015, effectively making his group an affiliate of the Islamic State and causing it to be rebranded to ISWAP.\n\nThe group added in the report that following Shekau\u2019s pledge, ISIS began sending support to Nigeria in the form of ideological and operational guidance, and also some material assistance.\n\nRegardless, Shekau\u2019s continued brutal attacks on religious interests, including mosques, and using underage girls as suicide bombers ensured that opposition against him remained.\n\nIn August 2016, ISIL appointed Abu Musab al-Barnawi (Habib Yusuf), 27-year-old son of original Boko Haram founder, Yusuf, as the leader of the group in place of Shekau. But Shekau refused to recognise Barnawi\u2019s authority and split off part of the group under its original name of Jamaat Ahlus Sunnah li Dawah wal Jihad, while Barnawi led the Islamic State\u2019s West African province, which at the time was said to have had about 3,500 fighters, while Shekau led his group, he only had 1,500.\n\nThe major point of departure between Shekau and ISWAP, as he narrated in a recording before his reported death, was his insistence that people living under control of the Nigerian state cannot be Muslims \u2013 a \u2018kafir\u2019 \u2013 and thus deserved death as much as Nigerian soldiers.\n\nIn the said audio, Shekau who admitted to pledging allegiance to Al-Qaeda soon after he went into the forest, also revealed that his group once received N50 million and weapons from Al-Qaeda, with the money leading to infighting between his followers. Following the split, clashes between the two groups continued.\n\nOn 12 September 2016, 30 of Shekau\u2019s soldiers were killed and 40 captured by ISWAP. In October 2016, Shekau\u2019s fighters attacked the Karino area south of Lake Chad with 350 men seizing the village of Tunubuma. Then Barnawi\u2019s soldiers counter-attacked, killing more than 75, including a commander, Muhammad Bakr.\n\nHowever, while Shekau executed outright, fighters of ISWAP captured by his men, Barnawi spared Shekau\u2019s fighters captured by his own group, and instead won their loyalty. As a result, he gradually won the hearts of most of the fighters, including Shekau\u2019s men, which made his eventual capture easier.\n\nOn May 19 2021, it was reported that Shekau was killed in an operation conducted by ISWAP the previous day, but a more accurate report later emerged that he blew up himself.\n\nIndeed, in the recording said to have been his last words before he blew himself up, he blamed betrayal by his own men for his capture, hinting that many were already working with ISWAP against him.\n\nISWAP last week, officially announced that it has replaced Shekau with Abu Musab al-Barnawi. The terror group said Abu Musab \u201ctakes over all territories that were under Shekau. The immediate replacement of Shekau was a major revenge against the former Boko Haram leader that exhibited \u2018highhandedness and ruthlessness\u2019 against humanity in the Northeast.\u201d\n\nThe announcement also included that ISWA had arrested thirty top commanders that were loyal to Shekau, as it consolidates hold of the territories, with the potential threat that may come with it.\n\nStaying Afloat in the Face of Huge Odds\n\nWhen in May 2019, Professor Babagana Zulum assumed office as the new governor of Borno, he was effectively taking up a huge challenge of providing governance in a state beset by terrorism.\n\nHowever, even in the midst of the huge challenges posed by the terror groups\u2019 continuing campaign, which analysts assert may get more complicated with ISWAP now fully in charge of the Sambisa Forest, his government has been making the best out of a bad situation, as relevant figures on the state economy suggest.\n\nHis down to earth approach to governance has also endeared him to many who continue to commend his determination despite the odds.\n\nBudget:\n\nIn January, Zulum signed the state\u2019s N248 billion 2021 budget passed by the state assembly into law, more than the figure of most states of the federation.\n\nThe figure saw an addition of N40 billion from the original N208 billion proposed by the governor, out of which N135.1 billion, representing 65 percent was for capital projects, while N72 billion was for recurrent.\n\nThe governor assured that the government would sustain its priority on security, education, Healthcare, Agriculture, provision portable water as well as reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement of internally displaced persons and refugees.\n\nIGR\n\nBorno ended 2020 with an internally generated revenue of N11.5 billion, representing steady improvement from the 2019 figure of N8.1billion and N6.5billion in 2018.\n\nThe 2020 figure, though not spectacular, and not up to 10 percent of the N60billion that the state got as federal allocation for the year, it may still be regarded as a feat for a state facing huge odds, given, especially that it is bigger than those of a number of other more peaceful states such Taraba, Adamawa, Ekiti, Jigawa, Gombe, Benue, Katsina and Niger.\n\nBorno, which ended 2020 with 43 percent unemployment rate, is one of the worst hit states of the federation, but even with its terror issues, is not the worst hit state.\n\nImo, at Imo 56 percent unemployment rate, took emerged the state with highest in the country, followed by Adamawa 54 percent, Cross River 53 percent, Akwa Ibom 51 percent, Abia 50 percent, Edo 49 percent, Anambra 44 percent, while Rivers at 41 percent is not far off.\n\nProjects\n\nIn his first one year in office, Zulum was said to have executed 326 capital projects and 49 capital-intensive programmes, according to his Secretary to the State Government, Usman Jidda Shuwa.\n\nThese were 53 projects in 21 LGAs, 11 of which were started from scratch while 42 were reconstruction works. The projects centred on council secretariats, lodges, police stations, LEA offices, courts and palaces of resident traditional rulers.\n\nLast week, the governor acquired 18 heavy duty road construction equipments at N1.4bn to kick start Borno urban renewal project with a view to reducing the cost of road maintenance and construction in the state.",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nOn Sunday, Ahmed Gulak, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), became the first high profile victim of troubling escalation of insecurity in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast.\n\nA former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan and one time self-declared national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Gulak who was chairman of the APC committee that conducted a controversial primaries for Imo governorship election, was shot dead by gunmen while returning to Abuja from Owerri, Imo state capital.\n\n\u201cOn the 30/5/2021, at about 07:20hrs, armed bandits intercepted and attacked a Toyota Camry cab carrying Ahmed Gulak and two others who were on their way to Sam Mbakwe Airport to catch a flight,\u201d a statement from SP Bala Elkana, Imo Police Public Relations Officer on behalf of the state commissioner of policestatement said.\n\n\u201cAhmed Gulak left his room at Protea Hotel without informing the Police nor sister agencies in view of the fragile security situation in the South East and Imo in particular. He left without any security escorts and while the cab driver took irregular route to the airport, six armed bandits who rode in a Toyota Sienna intercepted, identified and shot at Ahmed Gulak at around Umueze Obiangwu in Ngor-Okpala Local Government Area close to the Airport.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Imo CP Abutu Yaro, fdc has directed a discreet investigation into the matter as Tactical and Special forces have been deployed to cordone the area and arrest perpetrators.\u201d\n\nGulak\u2019s death is testament to the dangerous turn of events in the region. And has since taken ethnic and political colouration. The government in Imo has been keen on blaming political opponents. On Sunday evening, the police said they neutralized his assailants, and blamed his killing on the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB). Meanwhile, the separatist group has denied involvement, arguing in a statement by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, that it had no reason to target the politician, as he was no threat to its quest for Biafra.\n\n\u201cWe state without equivocations that IPOB knows nothing about the said assassination. In the first place, what threat did the late Gulak constitute to our cause to warrant his elimination? We had nothing in common with him and could not have in any way killed him,\u201d Powerful said.\n\n\u201cPointing accusing fingers at IPOB for this barbaric act is only meant to divert attention away from the real masterminds. This is the same way terrorists in security uniform commit various atrocities in South-East and turn around to blame IPOB for their crimes just to tarnish our global reputation.\u201d\n\nThe latest round of incidents started on Friday evening, when an uneasy calm that had hitherto pervaded Owerri after days of tension, was once again broken by a rattle of gunshots that sent everyone at Naze Timber Market, popularly called Ogbosisi and the surrounding vicinity scampering for safety.\n\nA team of policemen barged into a restaurant where two young men had gone to eat food, accused them of \u201cbeing among\u201d and after stabbing one severally with a knife, took them away, along with the restaurant owner\u2019s 24-year-old son.\n\n\u201cI was in my shop, a run a restaurant at Ogbosisi. At about 5:30, all of a sudden, people started running,\u201d the restaurant owner, a mother in her 50s, narrated to a local radio station, Ozisa FM, Owerri.\n\n\u201cI told my son who was assisting me in to shop to go and help me pound some palm fruits. He was at it when tension started. We looked outside and saw many policemen. They came in about eight Hilux vans. People were running. I told my son to go and continue what he was doing.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, two young men came into the shop and asked for food. I was about to get the food when the policemen came into the shop and shouted that we should lie down. We all lied down. Then they started beating the two boys. They told them that they were among, but the boys said they were not among. They removed one of the boys\u2019 shirt and started stabbing him with a knife. The second boy who is Yoruba, started shouting that he is Yoruba.\u201d\n\nThe raid had been prompted by the killing of two Air Force personnel attached to Air Force Regiment, Owerri by those the police identified as hoodlums.\n\n\u201cTwo Nigeria Air Force personnel were killed at Naze Timber Market by hoodlums and that was why Police personnel are there to mop up arrest,\u201d said the Imo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro.\n\nYero said the deceased officers had gone to a selling point around the area to buy food to eat, when they were shot dead.\n\nFriday\u2019s tension spiralled into the weekend, as security challenge continue to escalate across the Southeast -including the adjoining South South \u2013 once Nigeria\u2019s most peaceful zone, but which has in recent months, become a tensed area. An undeclared war between a gang of gunmen suspected to be sympathetic to the IPOB, a separatist group agitating for separation from Nigeria, and security forces in the zone continues unabated.\n\n\u201cIn Owerri this evening (Saturday evening) almost all the streets have been overrun by these police/ Army guys, No where is safe, but we are safe in Jesus name,\u201d lamented Nwa Cellinus, @divergentscout a resident of the Imo capital, a once tranquil city that has become a crisis zone.\n\nElsewhere, on Saturday evening, some gunmen unleashed attacks on Nigeria Immigration Service Abia State head office located in the Ubakala axis of Enugu/Port Harcourt Expressway. The attack had come hours after the State Criminal Investigation Department in the state was razed by some shirtless gunmen.\n\nTwo civilians, young male tricycle driver and another young man were killed by stray bullets in the ensuing exchange. Civilians have been at the receiving end. Innocent bystanders have also been routinely shot by armed forces and many have been arrested and accused of being members of the killer gang, particularly in Imo, which has since become the epicenter of the crisis.\n\n\u201cWe no longer sleep with two eyes closed,\u201d Emeka Ugwu, a resident of Owerri told our correspondent on Saturday. \u201cEverywhere there is tension.\u201d\n\nOrlu had been the hot spot. Confrontation between the gunmen who began attacking police stations in various states of the region earlier in the year, and security forces had led to destruction of life and property. But attention has since shifted to Owerri, the state capital, where the past few days have witnessed series of gun violence, either by cult groups or the killer squad and the security forces, as each camp continue to hunt down the other. Body counts are piling up, even as fear of the unknown pervade the atmosphere.\n\nIn Enugu on Sunday, a team of mobile police men arrested 57 aged men at church and accused them of belonging to IPOB. They were marched, hands in the air, staggering legs, in a single file like surrendering enemy soldiers in a war. And after hours of interrogation, were released because \u201cno incriminating materials were found on them.\u201d\n\nThe Anambra capital has continued to witness clashes between rival cult groups over control over parks, a violence that has led to the death of tens of people and further heightened the sense of insecurity a zone already witnessing a dangerous escalation of pro Biafra agitation. At the weekend, Anambra governor, Willie Obiano announced dusk to dawn ban on tricycle and mini buses in an effort to contain the crisis.\n\n\u201cNobody knows where all these are leading to,\u201d said a trader in Awka, Anambra State, Okwu Ozioko. \u201cDaily we here gunshots. It\u2019s just very worrisome.\u201d\n\nFortnight ago, the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba declared war on the agitators and the gunmen and ordered their complete extermination without regard for conventional rules of engagement.\n\nDont mind the media shout; do the job I command you. If anyone accuses you of human rights violation, the report will come to my table and you know what I will do. So, take the battle to them wherever they are and kill them all. Dont wait for an order, he had said while addressing the Police Mobile Force and Special Tactical Squad of the Force in Enugu shortly after he launched, Operation Restore Peace, a special operation in response to the unfolding events.\n\nWhat another order are you waiting for when Mr. President had ordered you to shoot anybody carrying AK-47 rifle? Quote me, even a dead policeman can be tried and dismissed from the force and his family will not get his benefits. So, dont seat and wait for them to come; take attack to them and dont lose your arms to criminals.\n\nThe order soon attracted criticisms, especially because the IGP had not pronounced similar orders in the country\u2019s North West and North Central where bandits mostly of Fulani extraction, have continued to wreak havoc, neither has he ordered shoot-at-sight in the North East, his own zone where more than a decade long insurgency has defied solution.\n\nHeavy deployment of the military had also followed in the contagious zone of South East and South South where attacks have continued to happen, all of which have combined to heighten tension.\n\nLast week, IPOB declared three-day mourning in honour of those killed during the Biafra war. Starting from Saturday, the mourning period is to culminate into a sit-at-home on Monday.\n\nOn Saturday, out of fear of the unknown, residents of the various states of the region started stockpiling foodstuff. Economic activities have continued to be disrupted. Transporters and food vendors particularly have been counting their loses.\n\nTension remains high. On Saturday, the gunmen attacked a military checkpoint in the Ihiala area of the state. Five officers were said to have been killed. In the aftermath, security operatives blocked the movement of vehicles at Onitsha Head Bridge, causing heavy gridlock which prevented vehicular movement in or out of the southern gateway.\n\nThe same Saturday, the gunmen razed the Atta Divisional Police Headquarters in the Njaba Local Government Area of Imo, before proceeding to the Atta Magistrate and High courts to set them ablaze. The same day, Izombe police division in Oguta Local Government Area of the state also came under attack. Attacks on police facilities have continued since the beginning of the year.\n\nOn Sunday, Alkana said the gallant officers of the Imo police command killed four bandits who attacked the Oguta station. But there no end in sight.\n\nMore recently, offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have also been burnt in a development that observers say, now threatens the 2023 general election, more so, the Anambra State governorship election coming up in November this year.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, soldiers killed five suspected members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the armed wing of IPOB, set up according to IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, to pursue Fulani herdsmen carrying out attacks in the zone. The outfit which was launched by Kanu in December 2020, has since been fingered by the police in the ongoing attacks.\n\nAnnouncing the development in statement on Friday, the Deputy Army Public Relations Officer, Lt. Colonel Charles Ekeocha, said 6 Division, in conjunction with Keystone, DSS and NSCDC led by Brigadier-General MD Danja conducted clearance/raid operations at suspected IPOB/ESN camp in Agbochia Forest along Pipelines Road Ogali/ Kom-Kom boundary between Eleme and Oyigbo local government areas of Rivers State.\n\nDuring the clearance/raid Operations, the team came in contact with the IPOB/ESN members. However, during the firefight, 7 x IPOB/ESN members were neutralized and 5 x suspects were arrested.\n\nItems recovered during the clearance/raid include: Communication gadgets, assorted cell phones, army uniforms arms and ammunition were also recovered.\n\nAlso recovered from the camp two AK 47 rifles, two G3 rifles, one locally made machine gun and one G3 magazine. Also recovered were include three rounds of 7.62mm special,10 rounds 7.62mm , 51mm NATO, one cutlass, five Baofeng handheld radios with chargers and 10 black berets.\n\nBut recent events, many say, are years in the making. When in 2012, IPOB leader, Kanu launched a pirate radio station, Radio Biafra, through which he propagated his Biafra gospel, he appealed mostly to a small group of disillusioned youths in the zone, and was mostly ignored by the country mainstream media, as well as the countrys then president, Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nBut Kanu soon came into the mainstream of political discourse, and achieved prominence in the country and beyond, following his arrest and detention by the then new government of President Muhammadu Buhari on October 14, 2015.\n\nHis continued detention despite court orders for his release, coupled with the continued extrajudicial killing of his supporters by the military, the police and other security agents, for holding protests in various states of the Southeast, ensured that he won more sympathy, more following, even as his reputation as political prisoner grew.\n\nBy the time he was released on bail two years later in 2017, he had achieved the status of a hero, and his following grew even stronger. Following his release, thousands trooped to his Afaraukwu, Umuahia, Abia State home almost on daily basis, to catch a glimpse of their new hero; the one who had promised them an independent Biafra nation, and had in their reckoning done enough to suggest he was no ordinary person.\n\nIn response, the Buhari government declared a military operation in September 2017, tagged Operation Python Dance 11; an operation that led to the killing of tens of people in Aba, Umuahia and elsewhere, in attacks by the security agencies. Kanu whose Afaraukwu home was the centre of the attacks, fled home and remained under ground until a year later in October 2018, when he resurfaced in Israel.\n\nKillings of his supporters during protests in the streets and at their meeting venues continued even afterwards. But as opposed to dissuading them from their agitation, they remained more resolute, even as Buharis perceived marginalisation and militarization of the zone only helped to win more coverts for the Biafran course.\n\nThe agitators have evidently opted to bear arms, and have set their eyes on security agencies, with attacks on them becoming more frequent. It is what could well be another big security headache for an armed forces already stretched to its near elastic limits.\n\nIn early January, the IPOB, through one of its facebook pages, Biafra Mirror, released a video showing more than a thousand young men being trained in an unknown forest. They were, the 5th battalion volunteer force of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), a non state security outfit formally launched by Kanu on December 12, 2020.\n\nThe authenticity of the video could not be ascertained by BusinessHallmark. The IPOB is known to rely sometimes on propaganda. But what cannot be denied is that the ESN, whose recruitment and training began months before the official launch in December last year, according to several sources, now has a substantial number of men parading forests and bushes in the zone ostensibly in search of suspected Fulani herdsmen accused of carrying out attacks on communities and sundry criminal activities in the zone, which the security agencies had failed to tackle.\n\nSpeaking on Channels TV on Sunday, Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, suggested that the inability of security agencies to tackle the menace of herders who have formed terror gangs in the region, kidnapping residents, raping women and preventing farmers from going to farms, caused the separatist group to form ESN.\n\nWhile condemning the formation as being against the law of Nigeria and therefore not acceptable, Ikpeazu emphasized that the separatist exploited a vacuum left by security agencies.\n\nBut recent events suggest the group is moving beyond forests. The chicken appears to have come home to roost. The zones streets have become danger zones for the countrys security agencies. Their places of abode have become targets of attack by elusive gunmen whose primary agenda seem to be accumulation of arms. Kanu, while denying the gunmen, has continued to insist that the confrontation between security agencies and ESN, was triggered by the former\u2019s attack on the latter for fighting herders in the region.\n\nOpinion leaders in the zone say the current situation was brought about by the government itself, especially the government of President Muhammadu Buhari who they said excessively militarized the area.\n\nThe Nigerian state at the federal level has failed in its duty to provide necessary environment that will be conducive for security and peace in the South East, said constitutional lawyer and chieftain of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Bob Okey Okoroji.\n\nIf you notice, the conduct of uniformed security agencies, the Army and the Police and other agencies deployed to the South East is nothing to write home about. They harass, they extort, they obstruct movements of people; they kill and generally make the lives of the people miserable.\n\nThey act like armies of occupation. And the people have endured this operation for decades. The fact is that it started after the civil war, but it got worse under the Buhari government.\n\nOkoroji suggested that the unfolding events could be a direct response to the state of affairs, arguing that, there is a limit beyond which people cannot handle endurance which has an elastic limit.\n\nThe leader of IPOB, Kanu, while not linking the recent attacks to his group, argues that the so called unknown gunmen are those who are responding to what he called, unspeakable evil of the army and the police in the region.\n\nThe unspeakable evil of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Police created this monster that is now consuming them, he said. The see no evil, hear no evil brigade, are accomplices.\n\nAnalysts say Buhari could have avoided what is now shaping up to be a gradual implosion of the country, with growing number of people in the Southwest and other parts of the country, also demanding to pull out of the Nigerian state. At the weekend, a group of Yoruba nation agitators, forcibly opened Idiroko Border, one of Nigeria\u2019s borders with Benin Republic, which has been closed by the Buhari government since 2019 to contain smuggling. The agitators seized a rifle from a custom officer and shot into the air. Sunday Adeyemi, alias Sunday Igboho, who is leading the quest for Oduduwa Republic, commended the action of the agitators arguing that the Buhari government shut borders in the South, but left those in the North open.\n\nIt is a very sad development. I condemn it and I feel bad about it, said Chief Anselm Njoku, leader of the Southeast APC forum in Lagos. Having said this, I believe that the Buhari government could have avoided the situation by giving the Southeast a sense of belonging. That way, Kanus message would not resonate.\n\nNjoku warned that even as things have gotten to this point, the solution remained constructive dialogue, as according to him, deploying force as has been the case, would only escalate the situation. \u201cThe government should approach the issue with wisdom and use the carrot and stick approach, he said.",
          "summary": "\u201cTwo Nigeria Air Force personnel were killed at Naze Timber Market by hoodlums and that was why Police personnel are there to mop up arrest,\u201d said the Imo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro.\nThe agitators have evidently opted to bear arms, and have set their eyes on security agencies, with attacks on them becoming more frequent.\nThey were, the 5th battalion volunteer force of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), a non state security outfit formally launched by Kanu on December 12, 2020.\nWhile condemning the formation as being against the law of Nigeria and therefore not acceptable, Ikpeazu emphasized that the separatist exploited a vacuum left by security agencies.\nThe zones streets have become danger zones for the countrys security agencies.",

          "text": "*Northern youth group threatens revenge, Uzodinma\n\n*Buhari, ex-president Akeredolu mourn\n\nVal Okara (Owerri), Tom Garba (Yola), Success Nwogu (Lagos), \u2018Tosin Ajuwon (Akure)\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has expressed outrage and disgust over what he called \u201cthe heinous murder\u201d of Adamawa State-born politician Ahmed Gulak in Imo State yesterday by yet to be identified gunmen.\n\nGulak, a former Political Adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, was reportedly assassinated at about 7.30 am at Umueze village, Obiangwu in Ngor Okpala Local Government Area on his way to the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo airport to catch a flight out of the state.\n\nThe late politician was with three others before they were reportedly attacked in a Toyota Camry car marked Texas BFT 2150.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, who confirmed the incident, said that he was on his way to the airport.\n\nThe CP said \u201cit is true, but the information are sketchy. I was on the way to the airport. Please call the CP in charge of Airport. He will give more details. You know that Imo command is different from Airport command.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Police in a statement by its spokesman SP. Bala Elkana said that armed bandits intercepted and attacked a Toyota Camry cab carrying Ahmed Gulak and two others who were on their way to Sam Mbakwe Airport to catch a flight.\n\nAccording to him, Gulak left his room at Protea Hotel without informing the Police and its sister agencies in view of the fragile security situation in the South East and Imo in particular.\n\nMr. Elkana further disclosed that the victim left without any security escorts and while the cab driver took irregular route to the airport, six armed bandits who rode in a Toyota Sienna intercepted, identified and shot at him at around Umueze Obiangwu close to the Airport.\n\nHe said that Yaro has directed a discreet investigation into the matter as Tactical and Special forces have been deployed to cordon off the area and arrest perpetrators.\n\nThe late Gulak conducted the controversial All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election in Imo State that brought Senator Hope Uzodimma as the 2019 party governorship flag bearer.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, on Sunday said, \u201cI am repulsed by such premeditated and gruesome murder of Gulak by evil people who are determined to undermine the peace, unity and territorial integrity of our country.\n\n\u201cLet me warn, however, that nobody or group of people who engages in such despicable act should expect to go free.\n\n\u201cWe will deploy all resources at our disposal to ensure that such callous and criminal elements are brought to justice,\u201d the President was quoted as saying.\n\nBuhari expressed deep condolences to the family of the deceased, the people and government of Adamawa, as well as Gulak\u2019s friends and associates across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, a youth group, the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), has threatened to declare Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma a persona non grata in the entire northern soil if he does not immediately bring the killer(s) of the ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Gulak, to justice.\n\nThe group in a statement by its National Vice President, Comrade Bishop K. Douglas, said, \u201cIt\u2019s so pathetic and saddened the continuous killing and lawlessness going on in the South Eastern part of Nigeria.\n\nThe government of Imo State must give an account of those who killed Gulak.\n\nThe continuous killing of Northerners and destruction of security facilities in Imo State will no longer be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe group urged the Federal Government to rise up to its constitutional responsibility of protecting lives and property and act appropriately so as to avoid the current situation from escalating to a civil war.\n\nIt explained that the government should take note that it would not allow the killer(s) of Ahmed Gulak to go unpunished, stressing that the Imo State Governor, who is the chief security officer, must bring those involved in the assassination to justice.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cLet us state categorically that National Youth Council of Nigeria (North-East Zone) will do everything within their powers to force the government of Imo State to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.\n\nThe Imo State Governor and other South East Governors should take note that we shall not accept the continued killing of innocent citizens and Northern elites in their region as we shall take revenge henceforth.\u201d\n\nIt gave the Governor of Imo one week to carry out the investigation or they shall declare him persona non grata across the entire Northern soil and Nigeria at large.\n\nFormer President, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, on Sunday, expressed shock over the death of his former Political Adviser, Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, who was killed by unknown assailants in Owerri, Imo State.\n\nHe described Gulak\u2019s death as a painful loss, and noted that the deceased was a loyal public servant and a dedicated patriot.\n\nThe former President in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Ikechuku Eze, which was made available to journalists, by Communications Officer, Goodluck Jonathan Foundation, Wealth Dickson Ominabo, prayed God to comfort the family of the deceased and grant his soul eternal rest.\n\nJonathan said, \u201cI received with shock the death of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, who died on Sunday, 30th May 2021, in Owerri, Imo State.\n\n\u201cGulak was a loyal public servant and a dedicated patriot, who gave his all in service to his country. His death is a painful loss to me and many others who worked and interacted with him.\n\n\u201cHe will be remembered for his modest contributions to the growth of our nation\u2019s democracy, especially his memorable days both as a skillful speaker of Adamawa State House of Assembly and political adviser in our administration.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMy deepest condolences to his family, the government and the people of Adamawa State, who are bound to feel the loss of this eminent and patriotic Nigerian.\n\n\u201cMay God grant his family, friends and supporters solace, even as I appeal for calm while law enforcement bodies carry out their investigations.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu condemned the gruesome killing of Ahmed Gulak, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nAkeredolu in a statement on Sunday described the murder of Gulak as senseless and wicked adding that those behind the killing are enemies of the country.\n\nGulak was murdered at the weekend by suspected gunmen during his visit to Imo state while the police claimed that bandits were responsible for the killing.\n\nAccording to Governor Akeredolu, the news of the death of Gulak, in Owerri, Imo State is very shocking and disturbing.\n\nHe added that killing was unacceptable and asked the police to fish out the perpetrators of the dastardly act.\n\n\u201cThis is one murder too many. It is senseless and wicked. The perpetrators of this heinous act are enemies of this country.\n\n\u201cThis contrivance is meant to mislead, confuse and destroy.\n\nIt bears the unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration.

          "text": "By Eric Elezuo\n\nHe is an epitome of what administration and goal getting is. He is Dr. Fidelis Anosike, the president /CEO, Chairman of Folio Holdings Limited, Publisher of the respected Daily Times of Nigeria among others.\n\nIn this interview, the administrator par excellence revealed the intricate nature of himself, the intrigues towards the acquisition of Nigeria\u2019s oldest newspaper, his political future as well as other sundry issues in today\u2019s Nigeria.\n\nKindly introduce yourself\n\nMy name is Fidelis Anosike. I am the president, Chief Executive Officer of Folio Holdings limited,The group comprises Folio Communications Plc, Times Multimedia Limited, 1st October Limited, folio media group folio investment and trading company.\n\nFolio Communications Plc acquired The Daily Times of Nigeria Limited. The company is the publisher of the Daily Times, The Sunday Times (TST) and The Business Times, The Daily Times Digital (DTND), folio Nigeria which is an afro pop digital content platform lunched in 2018 with CNN as an exclusive affiliate.www.folio.ng\n\nThe Folio Media Group (FMG) has access to the technology space and also doing a consolidated media offering to clients. the Folio Investment and Trading Company (FITC)is an investment company focused on media/creative/cultural industry investment and innovation.\n\nDr. Fidelis Anosike\n\nWe also have as part of the group, Folio Media and Creative Academy (FMCA)which is working in tandem with relevant authorities, bodies, companies/organizations to train journalists and creative industry practitioners. The aim is to train 50, 000 in those key fields in five years.\n\nDoes the Creative African eXchange perform the same function?\n\nNo, that is Folio Media and creative Academy. The Creative African eXchange (CAX.caxafrica.com) is part of the Folio Media Group. It is part of the initiative we are trying to use to consolidate the continental space of the creative and cultural industry.\n\nCan you shed more light on 1st October and Miss Nigeria as offshoots of Folio Media Group?\n\n1st October Limited is a publishing company that we set up in 2007 to publish the birth of Nigeria.\n\nSo it has evolved overtime because we have done over 10 different publications on Nigeria and state governments, and it also went ahead in 2014 to give birth to a global public perception movement for Nigeria called Nigeria, Our Heritage.\n\nThis was launched at the Kennedy Centre, and it was the first ever African event at the Kennedy Centre, Washington DC on the sideline of Obama African heads of Government meeting. What we are trying to do with 1st October and Nigeria, Our Heritage is to see how we can transition the love of Nigerians to love of Nigeria.\n\nWe saw a gap there in terms of country branding, we want to create a platform that will enable us to use, especially Nigerians in the Diaspora to drive the love for country because at the end of the day, other countries spend tons and tons of millions of dollars in country branding.\n\nEven the United States spends up to $240 million annually to brand their country. You see, once you are in Europe, you take a 30 per cent cut. If Aliko Dangote walks into an office in New York, and says he is a Nigerian, he takes a 30 per cent minus.\n\nThat is huge! That\u2019s one of the reasons our national development is stunted, because our brand, the brand Nigeria has so much deteriorated.\n\nWhy? There are so many reasons: political instability, military government of thirty something years, advanced fee fraud, imperialistic gang up and many more. So you can see the reason it has happened over the years.\n\nThere is always a reason for everything. So we as Nigerians, what are we doing to change this for the future because people only do business with people who they trust.\n\nWithout that trust, we cannot have foreign direct investment coming to Nigeria. You can have $10 billion like in Lagos State, and you are happy, but you could have $100 billion. You can begin to see how that affects national security, the issue of banditry and so on.\n\nThe problem is image. Nobody wants to do business with anybody that is dirty. If you wear dirty clothes, you become non attractive. There are options; people can sit down in New York and put their money in Scottish windows or savings accounts and make returns.\n\nBut if you want people to come from China or America, you must present yourself in a way that even give them the opportunity to fly down in the first place before they can find out there are challenges.\n\nThere are challenges everywhere. Afghanistan is probably receiving more investment than Nigeria even as they are a war-torn country. So it is a matter of how you package yourself as a country.\n\nNigerians must help to improve the whole because when the whole collapses, the part, which may be fantastic, will automatically collapse.\n\nThat is what 1st October is doing. It is a big project. We just recently partnered with the Nigeria Diaspora Commission, and in October, we will start an immersion programme, which is going to bring 100 very young Nigerians from all the Ivy League schools in the Diaspora and bring them to Nigeria.\n\nWe will train them on issues of national development and deploy them to about 100 companies, and expose them to what Nigerians are doing right.\n\nWe know that a lot of things are going wrong, but let\u2019s amplify the right ones and let\u2019s also inculcate this into the young people.\n\nSo, it is going to be a deliberate effort to raise 1000 people young people that can become advocates for the country Nigeria.\n\nThe only thing we are going to do is positive and we can see the reverse impact. This is what 1st October is all about. This is a positive national development platform.\n\nWe have remodeled Miss Nigeria to become more than just beauty pageant, it\u2019s more of an young female empowerment platform was founded in 1957(54years ago) it gave life to all other pageants in Nigeria. (MBGN)etc.\n\nOur very first Miss Nigeria is still alive at 86, chief Mrs Grace Oyelude we shall also institute a commemorative lecture in her honour as a DTN icon.\n\nEvery Miss Nigeria is an ambassador of the Green Girl company, with projects like Green Dignity Kit (GDK) and Green Girl academy among others\n\nCan you please trace your background a little; how did it all start?\n\nMy father was an Inspector of Police in the Nigeria police force. I got into the university by drawing portraits so I am a graphic and creative artist. I graduated from the University of Benin.\n\nI tell people that the creative industry is not just my passion; it is my job, did loads of self-development got enrolled at Harvard Business School owner president management course (OPM 39)\n\nI am a Harvard alumnus, and being @HBS opened my eyes to how businesses are run properly.\n\nAt 24 years, I established Folio Communications, which went on to acquire Daily Times of Nigeria, the oldest surviving newspaper and noteworthy media organization in Nigeria. I regard myself as a creative and communication player.\n\nAnd since then, I have been trying to see the much I can do with the resources available to me both access to capital and knowledge.\n\nI also have investments in other areas such as water, renewable energy, and I am also financing some global companies on major research on mobility and renewable energy space.\n\nYou founded Folio Communications at 24, how did it happen?\n\nAll we need to do as human beings is pray for God to give us consciousness. If you can get consciousness at 10; you can get consciousness at 30; you can get consciousness at 70. If you pray for the grace of God, you can get consciousness early. I think I was lucky to get consciousness early.\n\nHow I founded Folio at 24? I had an uncle of mine that worked with the Central Bank, and he introduced me to the Head of Communication, Mr. Bolarinwa of blessed memory, and Mr. Amobi, and they allowed me to enter for CBN creative jobs.\n\nAt that time, when they want to make a Christmas cards, Eid cards or something like that, they make it open, and whoever wins, that is if they pick your design, you will be commissioned to do packaging.\n\nI won on three occasions, and the price for each was 14,500 naira. With that, I was able to get my office, and went to create an ecosystem of my friends that studied graphics with me. Whenever a company that needs our services, we all make design submissions and as fate would have it, one of them always won.\n\nTogether we won on many occasions for companies like First Bank, NNPC, and CBN etc.\n\nThat was how I was able to build up capital to go into the communication business. I created a standard for myself and friends and became a relationship manager for them because they were all in a paid job.\n\nWhoever\u2019s design that was successful shared the proceeds with others. It was a case of all for one, one for all. We designed, restructured and produced all the diaries of NNPC for 2years running through open and competitive bid process.\n\nIntroduced Nigerian idioms into those diaries rather than white labeled ones from FT and co, gave it local content.\n\nAll because of the love we have for the country, I am fully Nigerian; and I am proud of my ethnicity as an Igbo man. If there is no Nigeria, there will be no Igbo. None of us chose to be here, but we are here.\n\nNo one chose his father or mother, and so cannot restructure his parents. We must not use all the energy we have to think of how to dethrone what we had no hand in creating.\n\nIn the past 60 years, we have been talking about restructuring; we could have used that same energy for better things.\n\nBoth Obasanjo and Jonathan had the opportunity to restructure, but they didn\u2019t.\n\nNow, Buhari is here and you are asking him to do this and do that when you couldn\u2019t do anything when you were there in that regard.\n\nIf all the presidents we have had, had taken up one thing and built on it, it would have been better.\n\nObasanjo should have picked one place and converted it to Eldorado, and same with Jonathan.\n\nIf they accuse you of ethnicity, it doesn\u2019t matter. Babangida did it with Abuja on the pretense that Lagos was not safe and proper as Federal capital That could have been an ethnic agenda.\n\nAnd today, everyone is enjoying Abuja, and no one remembers it was an Hausa man that built it.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t matter. If it will bring about economic development. With economic development, there will be no banditry. The question is why are we even talking about these things?\n\nThe answer is for years, we have all been sitting down. The governors of the states were busy manipulating local governments, collecting security votes and doing nothing with them, and nobody made a sound. There are consequences for inaction.\n\nWhat is happening today is a consequence of long-time inaction; of doing the wrong thing, and not having ideas for doing the right thing. Most of the governors were busy building airports they don\u2019t need, but neglected the primary schools that are supposed to train people that would shape the future.\n\nThey neglected education, and dwelt on less important things. So when you lose empathy, you start approaching things from the middle.\n\nThat explains why conspiracy theory comes in. Then someone will start by accusing Fulani herdsmen.\n\nThose cows they rear are owned by politicians; the herdsmen are just transporters. The cows are expensive, so in the same way a bullion van carrying N5 million goes about with armed escort, well\u2026\n\nWhen exactly was Folio Communications established?\n\nThat should be in 1991. In 2004, Daily Times was put up for sale. Before then, they had tried to sell the shares through public offer through the stock exchange, but it failed, So BPE resorted to Core Investor Sale which refers to a situation where whoever buys it, takes full management control, folio Communications was already a thriving communication company, and so felt that we needed a media voice and had to create a media company.\n\nLong before then, I was already involved in some creative work for ThisDay, and that was how I met Chief Dele Momodu. I had a lot of background knowledge. I reasoned that if I had to make my dream known, I needed a media voice.\n\nSo I entered the bid as the singular company involved, others were consultants and consortiums.\n\nWe were pre-qualified, and made a deposit of $10,000 and put in our technical bid. We were number one. We actually scored 81 per cent. T\n\nhis terrain was known to me. I learnt under Dele Momodu and Nduka Obaigbena; these are men who are far ahead of their time.\n\nI\u2019m sure that until Dele celebrated 60, people may have been thinking he was 90, and so was Nduka.\n\nThey are my pillars including Okagbue Aduba, when it comes to how I was able to understand Nigeria and how it works. I connected with their energy which was infectious.\n\nAt that point I already had $1 million for the bid bond. This is a security for your integrity, and so no bank will lend you money for a bid bond You can only finance it with equity.\n\nIt is money you lose if at the end of the day, you did not pay the bid price Daily Times Bid Bond then was N100 million.\n\nYou know they had earlier tried selling it via shares, hoping people will buy and someone will acquire the majority, but nobody came in.\n\nThis was because the media industry in Nigeria is not bankable; it has not been restructured so it doesn\u2019t have capital flowing into it.\n\nWe bided and attracted N1.25 billion into the media industry as far back as 2004\n\nIn our first bid, was i think N327 million, our competitor, bided N800million in their first bid.\n\nThat was N500 million above us. But we knew the bid was in two rounds. Our second-round bid was N1.25 billion, while our competitor second round bid was N1.05b and we won.\n\nWhen we bought and took over Daily Times, its liability was N1.9 billion; the assets were N2.3 billion; the enterprise value was N700 and something million.\n\nWe bought Daily Times at almost twice the price the government was hoping to get.\n\nIt is on record, and I was about 35 years old then.\n\nNobody would have given an Igbo man (Boy) a chance to buy Daily Times. I am a testimony that things can work in Nigeria if you believe. I had no godfather, only by faith and audacity of hope.\n\nDaily Times has had several managing directors and top executives from southwest majorly.\n\nThe company was created by Adeyemo Alakija and the London Mirror Group. It went on to have Dr. Ernest Ikoli, Alhaji Babatunde Jose, Amb. Dele Cole, Aremu Segun Osoba, Chief Tunji Oseni, Prince Tony Momoh, Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Innocent Oparadike, Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu, and Chief Sam Amuka Pemu among others.\n\nThe Daily Times was the biggest mouthpiece in the country. At one time, Alhaji Babatunde Jose was asked if he would run for president, and he said he was already chairman of Daily Times.\n\nThat was how big the Daily Times was. It was the fourth estate of the realm.\n\nBecause I did appreciate the enormity of what I took upon my shoulder when I took it over, the commercial problems arising from property didn\u2019t weigh me down I am not a property person the only thing (personal property) I own in Abuja was bought with my money No government or minister can claim to have given me any Land.\n\nWhen we took over Daily Times of Nigeria there were about 400 staff in the company then, and money from the government was not going to be coming anymore. So we had to restructure.\n\nWe had to downsize, and fought with the union for two years.\n\nDuring the fight with the union, the business was closed down. Then Hallmark Bank, which loaned us the money, took over the company.\n\nWe didn\u2019t recover the company through legal means until September, 2007. So, I acquired the company in 2004, it was hijacked by Hallmark Bank.\n\nEveryone was interested in the assets and no one was thinking about the liabilities. We had to go to court.\n\nThere was the man, Mr Adrian wood, one time CEO at MTN who joined us at Folio Communications; his mission and mandate were to revive Daily Times, and put it on the same pedestal as the New York Times.\n\nHe employed people from all walks of life; both Nigerians and Africans to make it a model. We knew that without a dominant and strong media organization in Nigeria, the issues of national development will fail.\n\nThat is why in America, we have Fox, CNN, etc. on their ideological beliefs, and tied to politics.\n\nWithout a strong media, there will be fragmentation, and that explains why the masses don\u2019t have a voice \u2013 an ideological voice then becomes commercialized and a merchandise.\n\nWe wanted to make Daily Times what it used to be. Thereafter, all sorts of people started taking us to court.\n\nAll these people came from third parties because folio acquired Daily Times alone, Like the typical Nigerian context everything is contentious not to talk of when you acquire a national asset. We adapted to many things in the cause of all these.\n\nthe first Times Heroes Awards DTN@91 in 2017 was massively supported. We interacted with many governors in the process. We see what Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is doing today.\n\nWe are proud of him. We saw the character the man brought with him to the office from day one, and gave him an award.\n\nWe gave award to people like Bello of Kogi State. You know sometimes you have to encourage people with potential or you lose them.\n\nWhat makes you tough is working and performing in tough circumstances like Wike.\n\nAnd this is why people respect Aliko Dangote, because walking out on Aliko is walking out on Nigeria. When his refinery starts operation, 90,000 people will be employed.\n\nIt is about job, job, job \u2013 that is what will bring National development, difficult circumstances should not be a limitation.\n\nWe use Dangote cement, and other products eg GB tomato farm/world class processing factory on thousand hectares in kebbi state and Kebbi rice and Olam Agric production establishment are domiciled in the northern Nigeria without remembering that they in the so-called Fulani area, there is good in every part of the country, and in everybody.\n\nWhy did you retain the name Daily Times after acquiring it? Is it because of its influence?\n\nNo, it is not because of the influence. Daily Times owns the largest archives. It is 95 years now, and will be 100 years in five years. How many media companies in Nigeria are 100 years old?\n\nDaily Times is beyond a newspaper company. It was here before Nigeria. It created the Nigeria Stock Exchange. It has produced two or three state governors. It is a national development company.\n\nIn the run off to our 100 years, we have created an event to celebrate icons of Daily Times \u2013 our heroes. Times Heroes. The first one that we have designed is for Ambassador Dele Cole. We are hoping to do these in their states of origin like in Port Harcourt.\n\nIn Port Harcourt, it will be a two-day event. On day 1, we are going to train about 500 journalists of that area so that he can inspire local journalists of that area; tell them how young he was when he went into the media and more.\n\nOn day 2, there will be a proper lecture where the likes of Akinwunmi Adesina, Wole Soyinka and co will invited as keynote speakers\n\nThere is nothing like making impact in your home state. We have lined up about 15 of our former\u2019s heroes.\n\nThe first one will be in Rivers State because that is where Dele Cole comes from. We don\u2019t want to keep celebrating people when they are dead; we want to celebrate them while they are alive, and learn something from them. We will talk about national development and the role the media plays.\n\nIn Nigeria, we let out heroes die without transferring knowledge. We need to have History of Nigeria because if you don\u2019t know where you are coming from, you won\u2019t know where you are going, we must return history to our schools. And that is what we are doing at Folio Communications.\n\nIt is important therefore we get this first one right \u2013 1st Ambassador Dele Cole Lecture towards Daily Times at 100. Secondly, we are developing a book, which Dr Onyema Ugochukwu will co edit with chief Tunji Okegbola DTN librarian of over 40 years to be launched at our 100-year celebration.\n\n2026 titled the Daily Times of Nigeria. planning for the 1st Patrick dele Cole lecture is on Amb Dele Cole proved himself to be an epitome of politics without bitterness, media game changer and diplomat per excellence.\n\nHe created the legacy of The Guardian and revived the legacy of Daily Times and when the government was becoming overbearing, he created a new legacy the guardian.\n\nThe planning for the 1st Onyema Ugochukwu lecture is also on in 2022, we will celebrate Ernest Ikoli, the first ever indigenous and founding editor of the Daily Times, we are also looking at celebrating Allahaji Babatunde Jose, Aremu Segun Osoba, Dr yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Sam Amuka-pemu,chief, Mrs Grace oyelude, 1st miss Nigeria, Prince Tony momoh.\n\nOur goal between now and the next five years, is to institute a minimum of 10 lectures. Each of them will be in respective home state of the icon, most of them and their governors have accepted.\n\nAnd they are all excited about it. And we will send a letter to Governor Wike believing he will be gracious enough to accept and host the 1st Amb Patrick Dele Cole lecture On the continent, Folio Media Group is an exclusive news affiliate to CNN.\n\nWe are not advertising partners; we are content partners; we are creating products with CNN.\n\nWe are currently working on a continental media project with CNN which should be finalized and announced soon towards capacity building in the continent aimed at increasing the African voice in the world and also curb fake news.\n\nIn The Daily Times, our focus has remained capacity building in media and creativity industries that is what can transform the industry to meet global standards and support national development.\n\nWe as a country need to build a competitive advantage in media and creative industry because it\u2019s our low hanging fruit and moreover most young people want to be in that industry so jobs are massively provided.\n\nWhy are we spending billions building monuments? We have 30 airports or thereabout, some of them are not working \u2013 they are not even conforming to the national aviation master plan because the governors just want to build monuments.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we channel those funds for monuments to other stuff \u2013 things that will create jobs?\n\nThe media and creative industry where our young people have been exceptional through self-help, let now be deliberate.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Nigeria Politics. At the moment there are several agitations: for secession, one Nigeria and restructuring. What is your take?\n\nMy take is very simple. Of a fact, people\u2019s views are a function of their knowledge. First of all, I will blame the government for not being proactive in the area of communication, but people should understand we are talking of banditry in Nigeria, and we still have coronavirus active.\n\nLast year was the first year that the whole country was shut down.\n\nWhat it means is that there will be consequences afterwards.\n\nPoliticians will lose their livelihood, drivers will lose their livelihood, and when people don\u2019t have livelihood, they look for a way out.\n\nWhen EndSARS was on \u2013 yes, Nigeria needed to end SARS because it cannot in the guise of solving a problem become a problem.\n\nWe have to understand that Nigeria is being exploited by all manner of people, and crime is also all about exploitation.\n\nIf those people crying about secession are given a position today, they won\u2019t talk about it again. At the end of the day, most of those cries and hues are not genuine.\n\nThey are mostly based on vested interest; that is my problem, there is no problem that cannot be solved, so dialogue is key.\n\nIf we shout about restructure, we should ask ourselves why hasn\u2019t the country been restructured till today.\n\nObasanjo was in power for eight years, why didn\u2019t he restructure? What was his constraint? So was Jonathan after convening a national conference, there may be reasons they did not restructure, so the cries and hues are okay.\n\nPeople must express themselves, but they should all work on the path leading to a true Nigeria. If we must secede or break you must explain the meaning and modalities to us; not after seceding, we begin to have issues among ourselves.\n\nSo all those calls must be interrogated. Now, we have non-state actors; people that did not even go to school leading calls.\n\nHow? Governance is intellectual. You see those who do not have temperament, who do not understand good and bad leading calls because they have a voice.\n\nThe cries and hues are okay though because they can form topical issues for 2023 elections.\n\nHowever, today, APC and PDP are the same; there is no ideology. The issues raised could become ideological, and any party willing to give what the people want would be chosen or voted into power the cries and hues are good and bad, but we need to ask ourselves what the real cause, Nigeria from far back is seen as a rentier state.\n\nIf your relation is announced as minister today, people will start congratulating you.\n\nWhy? We need few good people in Nigeria to understand that where you are is better than where you are trying to be, and then work violently to convince the rest to calm down because in the next one and half years, there will be an election.\n\nBuhari has just two years to pack and go.\n\nSo let not those clamors be an opportunity for people to further rape Nigeria and take advantage of the weak system.\n\nLet it be a clamor to formulate the issues that would form the agenda for 2023. When Buhari was coming, he ran his campaign on security, corruption and economy, and so it is easy to score.\n\nOthers can come with restructuring and more, and Nigerians can see how to vote in the right people. Let the past be bygone.\n\nGiven the opportunity sir, can you score the president in six years?\n\nYes, I think the president has done very well. I believe in foundation, and these are the foundations the president has established. What is the reason the president was able to borrow money?\n\nI challenge anyone to try and borrow N50 million, and you will understand. It is typical discipline. When the World Bank gives you money, they don\u2019t just leave you because the money is specified for a project.\n\nThis is number one. We talk about social programmes. We have an out-growers scheme today impacting on millions It was designed when Akinwunmi Adesina was Agric minister Go and check what is going on in Kebbi. By year month, you will see the number of tons of rice Nigeria will have.\n\nThe Dangote refinery has taken years; when it is completed, you will see the impact. It is a social programme because every day, we talk about subsidy, and subsidy removal cannot work without supply, and then money is channeled every other thing.\n\nOn infrastructure, we talk about the rail lines. The rail lines of today were started by Ahmed Joda and Obasanjo. It was an $800 million loan to build various rails.\n\nThis is about N6 trillion, today because of interest and non-completion, but today the projects were renegotiated and are being delivered as we can see. That was why the president was going to China back and forth.\n\nToday, you can enter a train from Lagos to Ibadan, and nobody is talking about that.\n\nIn my own region, for 15 years, we had senate president, economic adviser, and others.\n\nThere are three major roads in the south: East West Road, Enugu-Onitsha Road and Enugu-Port Harcourt Road.\n\nIt is only in the past six years that we have had consolidated build out. From Enugu to Port Harcourt today will take 1.45 minutes now This is a journey that previously takes three to four hours.\n\nThere is the Second Niger Bridge. I can go on and on. In technology, the issue of NIN for which Mr. Afolabi went to jail has been delivered. Yes, people may have a problem on how it is being delivered but no one can give what he does not have.\n\nIn aviation, the former governments took loans to build four airports, and the government added the 5th because the then Minister was from the southeast, she added the Enugu Airport.\n\nAbuja International Airport is delivered, Port Harcourt and Lagos international airports are delivered as well as Kano all in six years, and massive infrastructure upgrade with a reliable road map in place.\n\nThanks to the Aviation minister, nobody would have been moving around with this banditry. He has made it possible for airlines to be coming on board. Their style may be different, but there is a method to this madness.\n\nThese are foundations that i can connect to one good thing is that Buhari has actually changed to a democratic person.\n\nIn his first coming, he wasn\u2019t democratic at all. It is a big achievement that he was able to get that transformation.\n\nI think the government has done more than average in all ramifications, and I can challenge anybody to that.\n\nThe problem we have is expectation. We can only get the government we deserve. We cannot get an Obama in Nigeria.\n\nWe are all complicit. So let\u2019s forget about Buhari and talk about 2023. Let us take the good Buhari has done and build on it; let us take the bad things he had done and correct them.\n\nThat is the kind of positivity I want from few good men. Let us not tear the house down. Different versions from different people. Will a Femi Adesina tell you that Buhari is not doing well? No.\n\nBut the main concern is how the common man is faring now and how he will fair tomorrow. Buhari\u2019s continuation of his predecessor\u2019s project and supporting all competent regardless of affiliation are the way to go and a big lesson to politicians.\n\nGovernment is a continuum, PMB\u2019s legacy of walking across the aisle is a master stroke.\n\nOn a final note, one of the biggest reasons I say Buhari has done well is the 40-year-old Mr Bawa he appointed as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)the future belongs to the like of him and his peers, Nigerian corrupt practices have to be reduced that\u2019s the main threat of Nigeria. I don\u2019t care if he appoints only Katsina people once they are competent.\n\nDr. Fidelis Anosike\n\nThe Igbos are already leading in commerce. They love competitiveness, building new frontiers as of today, Igbo control 50 per cent of land in Nigeria; we have bought land everywhere so if you add to the five southeast states we have, we almost control half of Nigeria.\n\nTo aspire for power, you must be sure you have the capacity to carry it, otherwise it will feel like an elephant on your head.\n\nNational development is a journey let\u2019s sustain building institutions\n\nDo you nurse any political ambition?\n\nLife is dynamic. For me to have political ambition, I must have finished what I am doing now. I have not revived Daily Times, why nurse political ambition? One can create impact from wherever he is. Politics is not a vocation. It is supposed to be corporate social responsibility.\n\nBut people who have failed in their fields have found it as a sure means to buy cars and houses. These are depraved individuals; people that have complex.\n\nTo have political ambition, you must have thorough knowledge of the terrain and situation in Nigeria. You must also be sure you are going to impart on people.\n\nUntil I complete the transformation of Daily times, nothing else. Even God will ask me what I have done with the one he gave me. I am constantly building relationships, learning on how I can return Daily Times to become what it used to be.\n\nHow wonderful a family man are you; married, with children\u2026\n\nNo, I\u2019m not married. I have not been married for 10 years, hopefully, I should be. I have been married to my job for 10 years. I won\u2019t say I\u2019ve been a fantastic family man. I\u2019ve been married before. I have a daughter, who will be 14 next month, and a son, who is 11. Hopefully, I should be married soon as I am in a serious relationship/courtship.\n\nABOUT MR FIDELIS ANOSIKE\n\nDr. Fidelis Anosike is the President of Folio Holdings Limited, Folio Media Group, 1st October Publications Limited, Folio Communications Plc \u2013 publishers of The Daily Times Nigeria, The Sunday Times (TST) and The Business Times, with business interests in publishing, multimedia content creation and distribution, Renewable Energy, Smart Mobility and Investments among others.\n\nDr. Fidelis Anosike\n\nDr. Anosike is the protagonist for the Creative Africa Exchange (CAX), a creative industry consolidation catalyst (www.caxafrica.com).

          "text": "*\u2019Kaduna has none\u2019\n\nJohn Okoh\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Air traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) have decried the deplorable conditions in airports control towers across the country.\n\nNATCA, however, pointed out that there is no control tower in Kaduna airport to navigate the airlines, even as they have disclosed that airports such as, Katsina, Kano, Sokoto , Calabar among other aerodromes does not have up to 80 per cent functioning equipment.\n\nPresident of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), Abayomi Agoro who alongside his team played host to some aviation correspondents revealed these shocking realities from the lack of a control tower at the Kaduna Airport to lack of an urinary system at the Katsina control tower and failed equipment in Kano stressing that ATCs bear the brunt of the dilapidated system.\n\nDue to this huge gap, the NATCA members projected that the nation would be needing no fewer than 650 controllers nationwide to meet the needs of existing and new airports popping up, adding that this is because Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) employs over 4000 staff of which the core professional is less than 400, inadequate to meet present needs\n\nAccording to Agoro, the working environment is becoming deplorable\u2026 I said any of your members are free to walk into our working facilities you\u2019d get an on the spot assessment, as I am talking to you now, some airports do not even have functioning equipment.\n\nEven the Kaduna we are talking about, Kaduna does not have control tower what they are using there is watch room (for firefighters) which is not built for that purpose and we have been calling on the government to do something, we go to Sokoto, once it rains today controllers will go to look for umbrellas to sit at the control tower and what is it?\n\n\u201cSome of the control towers attached to the terminal buildings were ceded to FAAN while those standing alone were with NAMA but we have approached the two organization just like the lift too, NAMA will be waiting for FAAN to put it in order FAAN will say is it our staff that are working there?\n\nAnd that is because of that bureaucracy and you now discover controllers will continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nAgoro said they were still battling with terrestrial radio frequency, communication here and there adding that Calabar was also having similar problem stressing that there was no airport today that things were working 80 per cent.\n\nButtressing his point on Katsina airport expressed dismay at the working conditions thereof which he said there was no system to answer nature\u2019s call unless the ATC left the building which would be a breach of professional ethics.\n\nAccording to the NATCA boss ,\u201d In addition, you mentioned Katsina, Katsina today where you have a one-man watch and there is no facility for him to go and ease himself he is a human being, just to urinate, are we saying he is going to get a bottle?\n\nOr descend the tower? If he descends, he is in breach of his professional ethics so what do you expect that person to do?\n\nIn Katsina no restroom was provided, nothing, we are not just making claims, all these are verifiable these are facts that are there.\n\nOn Kano he said, \u201cAlso you mentioned Kano, Kano fine building, that all. The facilities inside unfortunately is a failure.\n\nVerify everything we say everything we mentioned here, we are not being emotional we are angry because if the system demands I put my whole life into it, I expect the system to provide me the working tools to be able to do that.\n\nI\u2019ve not spent close to two-year ab-initio in the training school for me to qualify as a professional for me to be frustrated by a system that does not want me to give my best.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NATCA President, the Federal Government is allocating money, NAMA also generates money but he is confused as to where these monies are going as nothing is being touched or improved upon in the towers.\n\n\u201cThings are not okay. Our members are also telling us that we are not doing what is expected of us. Do you know that if you get to some control towers ordinary chairs to sit, we have to go and beg.\n\nThis year I have met the NAMA management asking them that ordinary chairs we can\u2019t have for controllers who will sit 6-12 hours are you saying this persons will not have back pains and again these people have climbed the multitude of stairs because the elevators are not there or don\u2019t work, it\u2019s not ideal.\n\nEven when our members complain to us, we are in tears we don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d the president said.\n\nOn staff strength of ATCs nationwide and the impending workload Agoro said it was shameful that NAMA has gone on to employ everyone but the core professionals in the critical areas who are needed to do the job stating that even as there are lack of ATCs, redundant staff are sitting while collecting money for doing nothing only to run one week in, one week out shifts.\n\nAgoro said, \u201cwe should have at least 600 to 650 because let me also tell you there is no point in leaving one controller on duty in the tower, it is dangerous and we must say it and while a station like Kaduna has less than 6 Air traffic controllers definitely, they will work only one per shift but I can tell you that NAMA has close to 4,000 staff.\n\n\u201cEven in some department you see them drawing a roster,\u2019 if you come this week don\u2019t come next week\u2019 so what are we trying to say? NAMA at a point we tried to do internal recruitment just to see whether we can bring some of these redundant staff and train them at least it would help the system but they don\u2019t want, and those who agreed to convert they are regretting today.\n\nMany of the seven, eight years they\u2019ve been in one place which is a great discouragement to others who would want to, and what is NAMA HR trying to do?\n\n\u201cThey are asking who asked you to convert and go there. They are now our members but many of them are regretting, is that how an organization should be? And people come to work day in day out doing nothing and after sitting down they are paid.\n\nThey have brought so many people in the agency who are not meaningfully engaged all they just do is to sit down and we are talking about a critical area where we have gap.\u201d",

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has suspended Mali\u2019s membership in response to last week\u2019s coup by Colonel Assimi Goita.\n\nIt also insisted the military junta must stick to the February 2022 deadline for a return to democracy.\n\nThe decisions were taken on Sunday by leaders of the 15-member economic bloc at an emergency summit held in Accra, the Ghanaian capital.\n\nBut the group did not announce new sanctions against the military regime.\n\nThe meeting was called to agree a response to the Malian military\u2019s ouster of a president and prime minister for the second time in nine months.\n\nMali\u2019s neighbours and international powers fear the latest revolt will jeopardise a commitment to hold a presidential election next February, and undermine a regional fight against Islamist militants.\n\nIn a communique after the summit, ECOWAS said Mali\u2019s membership in the bloc was suspended with immediate effect.\n\nHowever it did not announce sanctions like those it imposed after the coup last August, which saw members temporarily close their borders with landlocked Mali and halt financial transactions.\n\nIt also did not call for new interim President Assimi Goita to step down. The army colonel, who led the August coup and last week\u2019s revolt, was declared president on Friday.\n\nInstead, ECOWAS said a new civilian prime minister should be nominated and a new inclusive government formed to proceed with the transition programme.\n\n\u201cThe date of 27th February 2022 already announced for the presidential election should be absolutely maintained,\u201d the leaders\u2019 communique said.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Goita, who attended the summit.\n\nGoita, a 38-year-old special forces commander, was one of several colonels who overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita last year.\n\nHe ordered the arrests last Monday of interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane. Both resigned on Wednesday while still in detention. They were later released.\n\nECOWAS and Western powers including France and the United States worry the political crisis could exacerbate instability in northern and central Mali, a home base for regional affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State.",

Willie Obiano for being on track in containing the activities of lawbreakers.\n\nMr. Godwin Ezeemo, an industrialist, said that creating employment opportunities for the youth would bring a lasting solution to the insecurity challenge in the country.\n\nEzeemo called on the government to create more jobs as a way to curb the insecurity challenge and appealed to the church not to relent in its effort to create a sane society.\n\nHe commended Obiano for fulfilling his promise of completing the Anambra passenger and cargo airport and urged him to complete other developmental projects.\n\nThe theme of the Synod was \u2018Divine Principle of Transformation through Discipleship\u201d.\n\nThe Synod attracted bishops and dignitaries from across the state.",

But the plan failed.\n\nBMO warned the former president and his co-travellers to quickly perish the thought and save the country from avoidable constitutional crisis and civil unrest.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, the pro-Buhari group lampooned the conspirators for their recourse to unconstitutional means to force the resignation of President Buhari, describing the move as reckless and anti-Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur highly reliable security sources have informed us of the determination of the former President to go ahead with a plan to cause disaffection in the country through a planned conference of so-called eminent Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhile the Conference ostensibly aims to review the state of the nation, we can authoritatively confirm that it is actually a premeditated plan to create confusion in the polity by calling President Buhari to resign after a supposed vote of no confidence.\n\n\u201cOur Security sources said the worries over this latest move by the former leader is not so much about the illegality of the planned declaration but the anarchical mindset behind it, especially given the growing resurgence of military putsch in the West African sub-region. Any appearance of national confusion, even if scripted without any basis, could fuel unreasoned confusion.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on Nigerians to be wary of manoeuvres by people who are desperate to erode the foundation of our hard-fought democracy to further the agenda of a desperate, bumptious and self-serving group of elites besotted with power to the point that they are ready to throw the country into a contrived pandemonium to remain relevant\u201d.",

Musa Ishaq Dala (Sarkin Hausawan Nyanya-Abuja).\n\nThe community leader, who was responding to questions on the ongoing public debate on the operations of the NYSC Scheme, described the idea behind the establishment of the NYSC as noble, stressing that the rural posting of the Scheme is an effective tool that fosters national unity, integration and grassroots development.\n\nAlh.

police checkpoint at Neni, Anaocha LGA; Obosi Police Station in Idemili North LGA; B Police Division in Awka; Ozubulu Police Station in Ekwusigo Local Government Area and zonal police headquarters in Ukpor, Dunukofia LGA.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the five states of Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia and Ebonyi, at the weekend stockpiled foods and other necessities ahead of Monday\u2019s sit-at-home order issued by IPOB in honour of those who died during the Nigeria-Biafra Civil war.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that residents of the five states have been involved in panic-buying for fear of the unknown.\n\nIPOB had asked states in the southeast to observe a sit-at-home today in remembrance of gallant soldiers and others who lost their lives during the Biafran civil war.\n\nIn Enugu State, the police, however, have assured residents of the state that there is no cause for alarm as steps have been taken to ensure the protection of lives and property.\n\nBut the residents in the state over the weekend, trooped to the popular Ogbete market to shop for their various needs ahead of today\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the market on Friday and Saturday, there was a surge in the number of people who went to shop for food items and other needs.\n\nThose who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity, said they were going to comply with the sit-at-home order.\n\nHowever, the Enugu State Police Command has asked residents of the state to disregard the sit-at-home order and to go about their normal business.\n\nIn a statement given to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Mr. Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, enjoined residents to disregard the order.\n\nHe warned any anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the peace in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt will be resisted.\n\nAliyu assured the residents of the commitment of the police to collaborate with other security agencies to guarantee public security and safety.\n\nHe called on parents and guardians as well as religious, traditional, town union, market, youth and other leaders to caution their subjects against allowing themselves to be used to cause trouble.\n\nHe also urged residents to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they go about their legitimate businesses, and promptly report criminal elements to the nearest police station.\n\nInvestigation revealed that there may be a compliance with the sit-at-home order in Ebonyi State, following the fear of possible attack on violators.\n\nA businessman who spoke to THISDAY that no one would risk his life to go to shop.\n\nMajority of residents who spoke on the directive said they would obey it.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, has threatened to seize any shop not opened for business in compliance with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe governor also directed security agencies to protect Ebonyi people against attacks from non-state actors seeking to enforce compliance with the sit-at-home order.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cI have been getting voices from some agitators that tomorrow there will be no movement. This is foolishness. If there is no movement in South-east, will there be no movement in the whole country?\n\n\u201cWhat an Ebonyi man will never accept is to go into second slavery under any guise. We know the Biafra we need, it is to have money so that we can cleanse off the toga of slavery that our brothers and sisters subjected us into. If you love Ebonyi State, bring money, come and put up one construction.\n\n\u201cWe want to see your investment in Ebonyi State. I want to say there will be free movement throughout today, throughout tomorrow and going forward and I challenge the youths, security agencies, local government chairmen to ensure that nobody is molested.\u201d\n\nResidents of Abia State were also in a panic mode yesterday following the weekend attacks on the State Crime Investigation Department(CID) in Umuahia and the sit-at-home order.\n\nPeople barely managed to attend church services yesterday amidst the already tensed situation. They rushed home as soon as church services were over.\n\nPeople were seen drifting to Isi Gate, the only area of the city where they could buy household needs as regular markets and most shops do not usually open on Sundays.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring,\u201d said Nazi Uzoma Udoka, a resident of Umuahia as he waited with his family to board a tricycle home after the church service.\n\nHe told THISDAY that \u201cevery day comes with uncertainties\u201d adding that \u201cthese days when people go out in the morning, they find it very difficult to return home at the end of the day as ugly incident would have happened and cause the police to block the roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to comply with the stay-at-home order because if you venture out the outcome could be unpleasant,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice spokesman, Geoffrey Ogbonna, a Superintendent of Police, did not pick calls when THISDAY telephoned him to find out preparations to protect the people.\n\nThere was also tension in Anambra State over Monday\u2019s sit-at-home order.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Eke Awka market, a major market that serves the Anambra State capital and environs on Saturday, residents were seen making purchases of food items.\n\nMany residents were also seen on Sunday at the same market in last-minute purchases.\n\nIn most churches in the state, residents were advised to heed the order, if not for anything, for them to be safe.\n\nBut the state police command has called on the people to disregard the order, saying it is doing all it can to protect the people.\n\nSpokesperson of the command, Toochukwu Ikenga, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, told THISDAY that, \u201cWe are not deterred with the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate in protecting lives and property. Just like any other day is, we shall continue to maintain law and order.\n\n\u201cWe (are) also encouraged by the support we have from the Anambra State Government, the citizens and especially Ndi Anambra. We urge them to sustain it. Together we shall police our state effectively.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, the Imo State capital, the residents observed partial sit-at-home during the weekend due to the worsening insecurity in the state.\n\nThe state police command had earlier warned IPOB fighters against disturbing the peace of the state.\n\nDon\u2019t Hoist \u2018Biafra Flag\u2019 in Delta, Police Warn IPOB\n\nAsaba, the Delta State capital, which shares a boundary with Onitsha, the commercial city of Anambra State, was calm and peaceful oon Sunday.\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command has warned members of IPOB not to hoist the \u2018Biafran Flag\u2019 in any part of the state.\n\nThe command, while expressing its preparedness to maintain law and order, warned that its personnel would \u201cdeal ruthlessly\u201d with any attempt by the IPOB or similar groups to cause trouble in any part of Delta State.\n\nA statement by the Delta Police Command spokesman, Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ari Muhammed Ali, had ordered police personnel to be \u201con red alert\u201d because of the IPOB\u2019s sit-at-home directive.\n\n\u201cThe command is aware of the threat of the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB) and their intention of parading themselves in some parts of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Delta State, who is determined to maintain peace in the state, has urged officers and men of the state command to be on red alert, watchful, and deal decisively with the trouble makers.\n\n\u201cThe CP, therefore, warns that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting \u2018Biafra flag\u2019 in whatever guise in the state,\u201d it stated.",

They particularly condemned all actions that led to ongoing instability in Mali, and its attendant consequences in the region.\n\nThey decided to suspend Mali from ECOWAS institutions in line with ECOWAS provisions; and called for a new civilian Prime Minister to be nominated immediately.\n\nThey also demanded that a new inclusive government should be formed to proceed with the transition programme; while reaffirming the need to respect the transition period of 18 months decided in Accra.",
