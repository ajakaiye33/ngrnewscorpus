          "title": "FG directs fleeing Nigerians to head for Romania, Hungary",
          "text": "The Government of Hungary has extended a hand of fellowship to Nigeria by waving aside the presentation of visas for all Nigerians in Ukraine seeking entrance into or passage through the country.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gabriel Aduda, disclosed this on Sunday via his Twitter page in a Public Travel Advisory.\n\nRussian President, Vladimir Putin, in the early hours of Thursday, ordered an invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe invasion was marked by shelling and rocket attacks on several Ukrainian major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, leading to dozens of deaths.\n\nThe invasion created widespread panic and saw many fleeing Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the core requirements for admission into Hungary from Ukraine included a valid Nigerian passport and a Ukrainian resident permit.\n\nThe Federal Government also advised that interested persons should carry some Euro currencies along.\n\nThe tweet read in part, \u201cThe Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Budapest, Hungary wishes to inform Nigerian nationals arriving from Ukraine, that the Government of Hungary has enacted Decree 56/2022 (24.11), which permits third-country nationals with valid Ukrainian resident permits to enter Hungary temporarily, without a Schengen visa. As such, Nigerians arriving at the Hungary-Ukraine border can enter Hungary, either on transit to Nigeria, or temporarily reside in the country.\n\n\u201cConsequently, arrangements are underway for the transportation of Nigerian nationals, to enable them to stabilise. To that effect, therefore, affected Nigerian nationals wishing to be admitted into Hungary are advised to have their travel documents (valid Nigerian passport and Ukrainian resident permit) with some money in Euros and cooperate with the Hungarian border authorities.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, on Sunday, announced that the Nigerian Embassy in Romania was ready to receive Nigerian students from Ukraine.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement released by the commission on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there were no fewer than 5,600 Nigerians resident in Ukraine, the majority of whom are students.\n\nUkraine is a choice destination for many Nigerian students, especially for those in medical-related fields.\n\nBut the Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffery Onyeama, said while the country was concerned about the safety of the 5,600 Nigerians resident in Ukraine, he confirmed that rescuing the Nigerians during the height of the Russian aggression might involve risk, Saturday PUNCH reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency, on Sunday, kicked against the denial of Nigerians and other Africans safe passage into neighbouring Poland and other safe territories, saying \u201call who flee conflict have an equal right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency\u2019s position was made known in a statement signed late Sunday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled, \u2018Statement on Nigerian and citizens of other African countries in Ukraine.\u2019\n\nCiting video evidence, first-hand reports, and those in contact with their wards and Nigerian consular officials, the Presidency noted that there had been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border.\n\nPutin puts Russian nuclear forces on alert\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday ordered the country\u2019s nuclear forces to be on high alert as the war with Ukraine enters the fourth day.\n\nIn a video of him on Sunday during a meeting with security chiefs, the Russian President hinged the decision on \u201cunfriendly\u201d economic sanctions against Russia.\n\n\u201cDear colleagues, as you can see, not only do western countries take unfriendly economic measures against our country \u2014 I mean the illegal sanctions everyone knows about \u2014 but also the top officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country,\u201d Putin was quoted as saying according to a translation by Channel 4 news. \u201cThat is why I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff to put Russian army deterrence forces on high combat alert.\u201d\n\nA country\u2019s \u201cnuclear deterrent means nuclear weapons available as a form of defence to prevent attacks from other nations.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Sunday in Arusha, Tanzania, said that sanctioning coup plotters without proper implementation mechanisms has not been effective in curbing unconstitutional change of power experienced in Africa.\n\nHe described a situation where West Africa experienced four cases of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in one year as disturbing \u201cbecause we felt we had put those things behind us.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo spoke during a bilateral meeting with his Tanzanian counterpart, Dr Philip Mpango, on his arrival in Tanzania for the inaugural session of the African Court of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights for 2022.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday titled \u2018Nigeria, Tanzania united on the need for a global push against the unconstitutional change of governments in West Africa, just energy transition.\u2019\n\nOsinbajo, who spoke about the need to promote democratic governance on the continent against the backdrop of recent coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in West Africa, emphasised the need for other regional bodies on the continent and others in the global community to support actions already taken by ECOWAS leaders.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe in ECOWAS have experienced in just under a year, four coups d\u2019\u00e9tat including attempts, and it is disturbing because we felt we had put those things behind us, and now they seem to be coming back.\n\n\u201cIt is something that we think has to do with more cooperation. AU has been very forthcoming (in condemnation) in saying that we cannot tolerate unconstitutional seizures of power. But sanctioning these coupists without any proper \u2018teeth\u2019 has not been particularly effective.\n\n\u201cThere might be a need for us to reach out to some of the regional bodies, development financial institutions such as the World Bank, IMF, and the EU. The EU has been quite responsive, but we think that we can do a lot more just in terms of cooperation.\u201d\n\nOn climate change and the attendant goal of net-zero emissions, Osinbajo observed that \u201cthe major challenge is that the wealthier countries are abandoning fossil fuels and gas and some of them are already defunding gas projects.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe in Africa will run into trouble because gas projects are important even for the transition. We need to come together to oppose any situation where the wealthier countries insist on going towards net-zero emissions in 2050.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Nollywood Celebrities Shipping Steadily",
          "text": "For every marriage that burns and fizzles out quickly, there is a famous celebrity couple that seems to be in it for the long haul. Despite all the menaces associated with celebrity unions, there are still a couple of them especially in the movie industry, who, have gotten a hang of their relationship, are enjoying blissful marriages.\n\nStill, in the spirit of Valentine, we celebrate some of Nollywood celebrity couples, whose marriages have endured and who, remain an inspiration to the rest of us.\n\n\n\nMercy and Odi Okojie\n\n\n\nNot many gave Nollywood star actress, Mercy Johnson\u2019s marriage to Prince Odi Okojie a chance, back in 2011. Her marriage to her heartthrob then was immersed in so much controversy that almost ruined the actress\u2019s thriving career.\n\nTen years on, however, the Nollywood superstar and her husband remain devoted to each other and have become the envy of many. The flame is still going strong, as recent photos of their 10 years anniversary prove.\n\nWhile celebrating their 10th year anniversary in 2021, the actress took to her social media handle to reaffirm her love for her husband, saying she would walk the path with him over and over again.\n\nIf you are wondering why their love is growing stronger as they get older, Mrs. Okojie stated that their marriage has been 10 years of grace, love, forgiveness, understanding, sacrifice, tolerance, patience, respect, and friendship.\n\nThe marriage is blessed with four children.\n\nOlu and Joke Jacobs\n\nThis Nollywood power couple has been married for over 30 years, and still going strong. They met in the 80s on Olu Jacobs\u2019s return to the country from England. In an interview with a major newspaper, Olu Jacobs had said that the moment he set his eyes on Joke Silva, he knew she was his wife.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe were having a management meeting for a play, Wole Soyinka\u2019s Jero Metamorphosis when a young lady walked in. Immediately she walked in, something inside me told me that she was going to be my wife and I told the people around me that I was going to marry her. That was in 1981. In 1986, we got married.\n\nSince then, the couple has been inseparable. They have blessed our screens with their talent, starring either as a couple or antagonists, in a variety of notable films over their impressive career. They are the oldest couple in Nollywood and have successfully debunked the myth that celebrity marriages never last.\n\nGloria and Norbert Young\n\n\n\nThe love bug bit these two at the audition of Gloria\u2019s first movie, Glamour Girls, where Norbert was also a member of the movie cast. The Veterans, Gloria and Norbert Young who got married in 2002 and celebrated their 18th marriage anniversary last year, are one of the oldest celebrity couples in the Nigerian film industry. While they live a drama-free and rather private life, their love for each other is pretty obvious. Gloria, who shot into limelight by playing Doris in the movie Glamour Girls, has hinged her stable marriage on friendship, her husband\u2019s sense of humour, maturity, as well as understanding and her playfulness. According to her, though their marriage had its ups and downs, they always found a way around resolving their differences. On his part, the actor, famous for his diverse roles in TV sitcoms says his wife is a quality human being and is very resourceful. \u201cShe is beautiful and very helpful. She is my friend.\u201d These two accomplished actors have continued to remain relevant in the industry while demystifying loveless celebrity marriages and breakups in Nollywood.\n\nOmotola and Mathew Ekeinde\n\nOmotola Jalade met her husband, Captain Matthew Ekeinde, in 1994 at the Solid Rock Church, Iyana Ipaja, while she was just 16 years old. They got married two years later in a court ceremony in 1996. They later had the most talked-about white wedding ceremony, conducted on board while flying from Lagos to Benin in 2001. Years in the spotlight haven\u2019t come between the Nollywood A-list actress and her pilot husband, with whom she has four children. For 25 years now, Omosexy as she is fondly called has been able to hold her family together without many scandals. In recent years, the talented actress has been showing off her husband and children on social media to the admiration of her fans and followers.\n\nLast year on March 25th, the couple celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. The mother of four posted some lovely photos and penned these words to her husband.\n\n\u201c25 Years Strong! Happy Marriage Anniversary to us.\u201d\n\nThe couple is no doubt a strong support system for each other and has given us reasons to believe in love.\n\nRichard and Jumoke Mofe-Damijo\n\nWhen TV star girl, Jumobi Adegbesan hooked up with the hottest bachelor in Nollywood, Richard Mofe-Damijo, not a few thought the relationship would see the light of day. Twenty years down the line, the lovebirds who got married in the year 2000, and are blessed with four children, are not only together, but waxing stronger in their love.\n\nThe Veteran actor who has starred in a variety of notable films over his impressive career, has in recent times, flaunted his love for his wife on his social media handle. The legendary actor has reiterated often that he owes his wife a debt of gratitude because she took a setback for him when they got married. \u201cShe was already a television personality people love and she could have been anything she desired to be, but she said to me, I am going to stop, get met a regular job, I don\u2019t want to be a celebrity and I said why, she said one person in the family is enough, you stay there and do your thing, and let me take care of the home front.\u201d He wrote on his Instagram handle.\n\n\u201cIf that is not love, at the highest level of personal sacrifice then, I don\u2019t know what it is, and so you can\u2019t have a partner like that and you won\u2019t step up in things you do. And, I am far, far, far from being perfect, but blessed with an almost perfect wife that would do anything for me.\u201d\n\nHis success as a father and career-wise he says, is just because he\u2019s blessed with an amazing wife.\n\nOmoni and Nnamdi Oboli\n\nWe have always admired star actress and producer, Omoni Oboli and her husband Nnamdi. They share some kind of facial resemblance and come across as siblings rather than husband and wife. While she may be successful in her career, she has equally drawn attention for being one of the celebrities who have proven that a celebrity marriage can last long. Omoni met her husband, Nnamdi Oboli, at a movie location in 1996. The pair got married in 2000, four years after they met: she was only 21 years old while her husband was 29. The rest, like they say, is history.\n\nTwenty one years on, blessed with three sons, Gozi, Chizi, and Tobe Oboli, the couple has continued to grow stronger in their marriage and love for each other.\n\nSo what is the secret of this lasting love? While chatting with an online platform, Omoni revealed that from the onset, she and her husband decided that divorce was not in the cards. She noted that their resolution was borne out of the fact that no sin is unforgivable. It\u2019s a person who decides whether or not to forgive an erring offender. Nnamdi has been supportive of his wife\u2019s career and also doubles as her manager. He is also a producer and has co-produced with his wife, blockbusters such as; Being Mrs. Elliott and Render to Caesar. While celebrating their 21st-anniversary last year, the actress took to her social media handle to reaffirm her love for her husband and commitment to their marriage. The union has continued to be a source of inspiration to young and aspiring couples.",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nIn September 11, 2021, Nollywood actor, Stanley Ebuka Nzediegwu, otherwise known as Stan Nze and his colleague, Blessing Jessica Obasi, walked down the aisle in a glamorous ceremony witnessed by family and friends.\n\nMany were surprised to discover that the two shared more than a working relationship due to their age difference.\n\nHowever, they succeeded in keeping their romantic relationship a top secret till pictures of their pre-wedding shoot surfaced on the internet.\n\nStan Nze and Blessing Obasi have been an item for about five years. The couple met in the line of duty and kicked off their friendship which later blossomed into marriage.\n\nIn celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day today, the couple shares their love story, sweetly made in Nollywood against all odds.\n\nStanley Nze: I\u2019ve always known I\u2019d marry an entertainer\n\nWhat first attracted you to your wife?\n\nThe fact that we connected easily and she was somewhat like an open book. It wasn\u2019t hard to read and see her for who she really is.\n\nWho gave the first green light?\n\nWe didn\u2019t see the green light anywhere. We just saw a red light, all of us jump enter.\n\nThis is your first Valentine season as a married couple. What are your plans?\n\nWhen we were dating, we didnt celebrate because we didnt have the time,\n\nSo, the plans for Valentine as a married couple is going to be a surprise. If I say all the plans now, how will it be a surprise? The surprise will be in the \u2018other\u2019 room.\n\nMarrying an actress, was that part of the plan from the onset?\n\nWell, I\u2019ve always known I\u2019d marry an entertainer, someone in the media (radio), music or an actor. I just knew I was going to be with someone in the entertainment industry. I wanted someone who would understand the sort of thing I do and it wouldn\u2019t be a challenge to understand the peculiarity of the industry in which I function. That was very important for me.\n\nI could have been able to marry anyone in any other industry but it would be easier for me here.\n\nWhat was your parent\u2019s reaction to the marriage proposal?\n\nI don\u2019t know how they reacted because I didn\u2019t tell them when I proposed.\n\nIs Mr. Nze a romantic man?\n\nWell, I try my best to be a romantic man because I know that my wife used to complain that I wasn\u2019t romantic at all. But over the years, I\u2019ve learned to make an effort to be romantic. I\u2019m still not great at it, but I think I\u2019m getting better, and there\u2019s always room for improvement.\n\nWhat are the interesting things you love about your wife?\n\nIlove the fact that she makes me laugh, she\u2019s such a great cook, she has a heart for people and she\u2019s such a lover.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest fear as a married man?\n\nIt will probably be complacency. When it feels like we are no longer making an effort to be better.\n\nI think that\u2019s probably our fear that we never get to that point where we are so relaxed, that, we are not improving to become better versions of ourselves.\n\nWhat challenges did you encounter in marrying a younger lover?\n\nThat\u2019s a bit too personal, I would not want to talk about it.\n\nCelebrity marriages are always surrounded by controversies, how do you intend to make yours different?\n\nOne day at a time. We are celebrities and we cannot go back to becoming any other person like a banker at this time. It is what it is. However, I know that I\u2019ve always channeled my energy to God, I don\u2019t have it all figured out, I\u2019ve never been married before, but I know Someone who is the author of marriage and that is Jesus Christ.\n\nSo, I\u2019m depending on him to lead me every step of the way, to be a good husband to my wife, a good father to my kids, a good son to my parents, and just a better version of me as the days go by.\n\nNow that you are a happily married man, what else do you look forward to?\n\nI look forward to being a father, I look to having my girls, nurturing and being there for them. I also look forward to being responsible for people.\n\nWhat would you advise the younger generation regarding relationships?\n\nDo not awaken love when you are not ready. I didn\u2019t awaken mine until I was genuinely ready to settle down. I didn\u2019t want to be jumping into relationships just for the sake of it.\n\nMaintain platonic relationships with people until you have come of age, and you feel ready to settle down. That is my advice, but you don\u2019t have to listen to the stupid things I\u2019m saying.\n\nBlessing Nze: Age is just a number\n\nThis is your first Valentine season as a married couple, how does it feel to be in love?\n\nIt feels really good. It feels very good to be in love. I mean, I\u2019ve been in love before Valentine, and it\u2019s such a good feeling being in love with someone who actually loves you too, if not more.\n\nHow do you plan to celebrate it?\n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be a surprise but of course, I plan to make it memorable for us.\n\nWhat specific qualities confirmed that Nze is the man you want to spend the rest of your life with?\n\nOur vulnerability, the way we bonded, the friendship we shared was very unique, and he was consistent all the three and a half years we dated. He was consistent, straightforward, sweet, like literally sweet, and his yes remains a yes. He\u2019s so truthful.\n\nMarrying a colleague, did you see it coming?\n\nAbsolutely not. Never. I never would have imagined that I\u2019d get married to my colleague or even anyone in entertainment because I used to think men in entertainment cannot stay with one woman, they are cheats. I saw them as promiscuous people and so I never saw it coming at all.\n\nMarrying a younger lover must be tough, what was it like weighing between age and love?\n\nAge is just a number, what matters is the two hearts that beat as one.\n\nWhat three things would you like to change about your husband?\n\nWell, I\u2019d say absolutely nothing. I\u2019m happy with the peace that I enjoy with my husband and he is a man that strives daily to be better. I\u2019m not aiming at changing anything, absolutely not.\n\nDoes marriage make you feel fulfilled?\n\nFulfilled? I won\u2019t say fulfilled because marriage is not the end goal. So, not fulfilled but maybe to an extent but not like I\u2019m fulfilled in life, I\u2019ve achieved all my goals in life, no.\n\nThis is just one level of fulfillment then the next. There\u2019s still a fulfillment of what God wants me to do, so much more I need to do for myself, my children, the nation, and the world at large.\n\nMaybe it is just a step in the direction of fulfilling my purpose in life.\n\nWhat was the parent\u2019s reaction to the marriage proposal?\n\nI\u2019m guessing they felt good about it.\n\nHow has married life changed you?\n\nBeing a lot more deliberate about my actions. For instance, I\u2019m sometimes like, \u2018you are a married woman, you can\u2019t just stay out late, you can\u2019t always go out and forget yourself\u2019. If for instance I go out with my friends to the movies and we end up seeing a couple of movies late into the night because we don\u2019t want to get home and be bored, now that I am a married woman, I can\u2019t because I wouldn\u2019t want to be perambulating Lagos like a homeless person.\n\nSo, I think there is a bit of sense of responsibility now but not from a place of being forced, it is just me talking to myself.\n\nWhat kind of roles would you reject now that you are married?\n\nTo be naked, I think that\u2019s the only thing I cannot do, going naked in a film.\n\nAs a married woman, what\u2019s your greatest fear?\n\nWhen people get married, they get so comfortable. It feels like a box that has been ticked but they are not really interested in servicing it as such. You\u2019ve ticked the box and you\u2019ve moved on so what else?\n\nSo, I think my greatest fear will be not really nurturing my home, keeping and building my home to be that place I always want to come back to and make it a safe place for my husband.\n\nSometimes, you see some couples fight like enemies and you begin to question why because, they used to be in love. So, what went wrong?\n\nLike my husband will always say, this one that this love is just doing us, hope tomorrow we would not later say \u2018go to your tent O Isreal\u2019 and I just say, \u201dwe don\u2019t need to work too hard to make this thing, we are already here.\u201d\n\nAnd the next thing would be motherhood, that\u2019s what the world expects of you.\n\nWith all these fears that will come because I\u2019m a human being, I put all my trust in God because he is our foundation, He\u2019s our essence, He\u2019s everything to us and no matter how tough things get, \u2018las las\u2019 I go back to Him to say, God, you are the foundation of this thing, this home and marriage was built upon the solid rock which is, you, Jesus Christ and you alone will teach and navigate this journey with me.\n\nSo, I\u2019m taking it one day at a time asking the Holy Spirit to help me.",

          "title": "Ruger: Man of Dior",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Rita Okoye\n\nMichael Adebayo Olayinka popularly known as Ruger, is a Nigerian Afrobeat singer, and songwriter.\n\nRuger came into lime-light in 2021 after signing a record deal with D\u2019Prince\u2019 \u201cJonzing world record\u201d with a publishing and distribution deal with Columbia Records, and Sony Music Entertainment, U.K division.\n\nAt the moment, he is unarguably, the head of Nigeria\u2019s new school talents and his latest single, Dior is currently one of the hottest songs in Nigeria.\n\nWe spoke to the singer about his meteoric rise, his style of music, and pressure from the new generation talents likewise dominating the Nigerian music scene.\n\nYour latest single, Dior has become a national anthem in Nigeria, what was the inspiration?\n\nDior is a diamond in the rough. The major inspiration for it is lifestyle. I was thinking of where I was, where I currently am, and my projections for the future, basically lifestyle. Some of the things I said I\u2019m not yet living them out, so I\u2019m basically prophesying what I want for my life.\n\nI talked about how I was living my life at that time, and how I want to live my life. The Song Dior is for ballers, every hustler, everyone who loves luxury and wants to enjoy life.\n\nHow long did it take you to record the song?\n\nOne day, we literally recorded it in one day.\n\nHow did music begin for you?\n\nMusic has always been part of me right from a young age. I decided to do it fully when I was in Senior Secondary School 2 to be precise. It\u2019s been my passion since then and I\u2019ve loved doing it.\n\nTell us your Jonzing World\u2019s story, how did it start and where is it going?\n\nMy Jonzing world story started with my freestyles on social media. I used to freestyle on Instagram back in the days. One day, D\u2019prince saw the freestyle, reached out, and told me to come to the studio and start working. Since then, it\u2019s been work, work, family, learning, putting in the work, having the knowledge that the goal is to go make it big and it\u2019s been bliss since then. I know we\u2019ve barely even scratched the surface. I\u2019ve loved being a part of this family. Jonzing world for life!\n\nTell us the inspiration behind your latest EP, Second Wave?\n\nI make music out of experience, so most of the songs there are about my life\u2019s experiences.\n\nWhat artists are you feeling at the moment and do you have any desire to collaborate?\n\nI will always feel Burna boy! Recently, I was listening to Burna Boy Essentials and I realized I know all the songs and their lyrics which makes me a fan. Artistes I\u2019d like to collaborate with are:\n\nKoffee, Sean Paul, Burna Boy, and Kayode KK.\n\nWhat makes your sound different? How do you define your sound or like it to be perceived?\n\nMy melodies are different, they always sound fresh and brand new. I want to be perceived as real because I do music based on experience so I want people to know that this happened.\n\nWhich of your songs blew your mind in terms of its success?\n\nDior! I wasn\u2019t really expecting too much from it. I did it and moved on. But D\u2019prince loves it and I\u2019ve grown used to him always playing it. So, it was surprising to see how big it got. I was so blown away by its success and I\u2019m super grateful for the acceptance. It\u2019s doing massively well on Tiktok, Instagram, everywhere!\n\nWhat was your highlight for 2021?\n\nPerforming at The 02! It was such a great experience and highlight of my year.\n\nWhat is the lowest point of your career?\n\nI don\u2019t have any low points, everything has been great vibes!\n\nWorking with the likes of D\u2019prince is a dream for many young talents, what are the biggest lessons learnt from him?\n\nPatience is what I\u2019ve learnt from him and to focus on the work rather than the result. When you are focused on the work, then you aren\u2019t pressed about what the result would look like. Also, when the results start springing up, you\u2019re able to appreciate and enjoy it properly.\n\nIf you are focused on the result while working, your work is already adulterated with what you think the result would be. You would have robbed yourself of the true experience and process of creating, and when the result or success now comes, it won\u2019t be as wholesome as it should be. I\u2019ve also learnt Hard work, putting in the work irrespective of what anyone is saying, just do your work.\n\nSo many bright talents in the industry, do you feel any pressure?\n\nNo pressure, I\u2019m enjoying myself. I love that everyone\u2019s dropping music and I jam every song from every part of Nigeria. And, since I\u2019m dropping and people are feeling me as well, it\u2019s exciting.\n\nRema recently went back to school, what are your plans towards furthering your education?\n\n(Laughs) Well, that\u2019s personal. I\u2019d do it when I want to do it and you will know when it happens.\n\nAre there no pressures from your parents concerning your education?\n\nHonestly, I won\u2019t call it \u2018pressure\u2019. My parents are understanding of the situation and encouraged me. In the period of seeking admission into the university, I got working, just to gain knowledge from other fields. I worked at the popular Computer Village in Lagos. I started as an apprentice at a phone repair shop before becoming an engineer after some months.

I don\u2019t shoot literally. I shoot musically. The way a sniper closes one eye to aim and hit their target is how I am with my music; one eye is shut so I can focus well, aim and hit right with my songs and projects.\n\nWhat has stardom deprived you of?\n\nI won\u2019t really say deprive, maybe what stardom made difficult and that would be my Spirituality. It\u2019s pretty difficult being a star and maintaining your spiritual life. I try to be strong, pray and stay in faith regardless.\n\nWhat is your New Year\u2019s Resolution?\n\nTo enjoy my life basically, to be present and enjoy every moment.\n\nAfter Dior, what is Ruger\u2019s next project?\n\nLet\u2019s watch and see. I don\u2019t like to spill things before they come to fruition. I like surprising people so let\u2019s just wait for what\u2019s coming.",

          "text": "Former governorship candidate in Rivers State, Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, has said his administration will put food on people\u2019s table if he becomes the governor after the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said he has plans to revolutionalise the economy, to create jobs outside the oil and gas sector, if he succeeds Governor Nyesom Wike after the 2023 general election.\n\nLulu-Briggs, who has not disclosed the party platform under which he will contest the election, spoke at the weekend at the Port Harcourt International Airport, Omuagwa when he declared his interest to contest the number one position.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy vision of Rivers is a state where there is food on the table, where there is education for all.\n\n\u201cWe want to look at the state beyond oil, because if you look at the indicators, we have asked all the questions, economists have told us, economy earners for the state is not even oil and gas, but tourism, ICT and agriculture. There is a whole lot we have not yet done.\u201d\n\nThe oil mogul said: \u201cThere is work to do. The work I have been trying to do over the years. I\u2019m still strong; I will have to give my best at all times. So, by the special grace of God, I will run.\n\n\u201cWe need that kind of political peace. The kind of development I am going to bring to Rivers State, under my government, there will be calm, there will be development, my administration will see Governor Nyesom Wike and former Governor Rotimi Amaechi eating together.\u201d\n\nHe believed that the reason he was the first in the state to make his intentions public might be because intending aspirants were still consulting stakeholders.\n\n\u201cRivers State is blessed with many capable hands. I am sure that soon they will begin to express their interests,\u201d Lulu-Briggs said.\n\nSpeaking about power shift to the South, he said: \u201cI have always been an advocate of national cohesion. Even at the state level. Rivers State is a microcosm of Nigeria. What\u2019s good in Rivers State is also very good in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, power has to come to the Southern region this time. I don\u2019t see any other argument we can present this time for it not to come to the South.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are credible Nigerians in various parts of the country. Very capable hands. You find them in the Southeast, Southwest and Southsouth. So, I don\u2019t see why there should be any argument this time after eight year of power being in the North, it should move down to the South.\n\n\u201cAlso here in Rivers State, I think it is time for the riverine to have a shot. Of course, we have good talents across ethnic nationalities in the state, including the riverine areas.\u201d\n\nOn the agitation by the Ogoni that the governorship should be zoned to them, despite being upland, the lawyer said: \u201cIn the upland, the Ogoni sure have an argument as well. You can\u2019t run away from that. Moreover, they are a major ethnic block. But what we experience here is a sort of dichotomy between upland and riverine areas. So, having been in the upland for this long time, it is about time it comes to the riverine, at least for that cohesion.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria may be at receiving end of some of the worst ripple effects of the ongoing escalation between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nExperts yesterday agreed that despite the steep rise in crude oil price and Nigeria\u2019s position as a major crude oil exporter, Nigeria\u2019s economic structure makes it more prone to the negative effect of the ensuing crisis.\n\nCrude oil prices spiralled above $100 per barrel, the first time since 2014, after Russia attacked Ukraine and continued a major aggressive push of what it called special military operation to demilitarise and \u2018denazify\u2019 Ukraine by destroying the latter\u2019s military capabilities.\n\nRussia vetoed a United Nation\u2019s resolution deploring the attack and has threatened never-seen dire consequences for any foreign country that interferes. The United States, Britain and European Union have unveiled sanctions against Russia, the world\u2019s second largest supplier of crude oil. Gasoline prices shot up in many global economic hubs amid anxiety over the escalation of the crisis.\n\nExperts expressed worries that rather than benefiting optimally from the surging crude oil prices, the inherent distortions in the Nigerian economy may worsen and topple the fragile economic condition.\n\nChief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr. Muda Yusuf, said rather than a blessing, the rising global crude oil price is a \u201cpenalty\u201d for the economy.\n\nYusuf, a former Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), in an interview, said the soaring oil price should ordinarily be a blessing and good news for the country as an oil producing entity. This is because such development will naturally translate to more foreign exchange and revenue earnings for the country; more profits for the oil companies operating in Nigeria and for other stakeholders in the oil sector.\n\nHe, however, regrets that because the country\u2019s oil sector has been grossly mismanaged, the obvious boom in the price of the commodity cannot be celebrated.\n\n\u201cThe rising oil price cannot be celebrated by Nigeria because it penalises the Nigerian economy and this is a paradox. The implication of this rise in oil price is that our import bill for petroleum products is going to go up; the subsidy payment on petrol is going to increase. If this trend continues this way in another six months, then Nigeria should be looking at a subsidy cost of about N5 trillion or more,\u201d Yusuf warned.\n\nAnalysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited, a leading investment house, said they were concerned that Nigeria would not optimally benefit from any ensuing rise in crude oil prices due to its suboptimal crude oil production.\n\n\u201cThis would increase pressure on the external reserves as well as exchange rates as oil dollar revenues, its primary foreign currency earner, would struggle to meet higher cost of imported refined products in addition to other imports,\u201d Cowry Asset stated.\n\nThey said they expected the \u201cnaira to depreciate against the dollar, despite the high crude oil prices at the international market, amid declining external reserves\u201d.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital said the position of Russia as a global power could cause major dislocations across the world, with more riveting implications for more susceptible economies like Nigeria.\n\nAccording to analysts, with a total nominal Gross Domesctic Product (GDP) size of $1.48 trillion, Russia is the 11th largest economy globally. Moreover, its vast economy and system of government also support its influence in global trade, military power, and foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, the impact of a prolonged Russian-Ukraine crisis will primarily impact inflation, the external sector account, and fiscal policy for the domestic economy,\u201d Cordros Capital stated.\n\nThey noted that while the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may have enough supply to support the foreign exchange (forex) market over the short term, declining foreign inflows and weakening of the external reserves could force further currency depreciation in the medium to long-term.\n\nAnalysts said foreign inflows are paramount for sustained forex liquidity over the medium term, in line with expectation that accretion to the reserves will be weak given that crude oil production levels remain pretty low. Thus, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) which have historically supported supply levels at the official Investors & Exporters Window will be needed to sustain forex liquidity levels.\n\n\u201cHence, we think further adjustments in the naira/dollar peg closer to its fair value and flexibility in the exchange rate would be significant in attracting foreign inflows back to the market,\u201d Cordros Capital stated.\n\nYusuf noted that since the government is keen on retaining subsidy, the profits that should have accrued from the galloping oil price will be consumed by the subsidy regime. Consequently, he said, the rate of petrol smuggling will also increase because smugglers will take advantage of the subsidised product from the country to enrich their pockets.\n\n\u201cThe differential in price between the Nigerian petrol and that of other countries will increase significantly, thereby necessitating an increased smuggling because of the higher profit margin. If smuggling increases, the amount of petrol that we claim to be consuming locally will also increase because of the relative price and the wide margin. At present, local fuel consumption is estimated at 60 million litres daily,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nHe pointed out that past increases in oil price had not translated to improvements in the country\u2019s foreign reserve and foreign exchange rate.\n\n\u201cThis is what ordinarily should have happened if we did not mismanage our oil sector. There was a time in 2014 when oil prices were high and our external reserve was about $60 billion- that is the kind of reserve we should be talking about now with the rising oil price; we should be smiling as a country but we have turned our oil and gas sector upside down. Rather than benefit from the rising oil price, we are going to be penalised by it. People are already selling diesel now at N500 per liter; everything will go up higher in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has warned the public of a newly-hatched malicious software that steals users\u2019 banking app login credentials on Android devices.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by NCC spokesperson Dr Ikechukwu Adinde at the weekend, the malware which was discovered by the Commission\u2019s Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), is called \u201cXenomorph\u201d,\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nNCC said Xenomorph has been found to target 56 financial institutions from Europe, has high impact and high vulnerability rate, with a major intent to steal credentials, combined with the use of SMS and Notification interception to log in and use potential 2-factor authentication tokens.\n\nThe Commission explained that Xenomorph is propagated by an application that was slipped into the Google Play store and masquerading as a legitimate application called \u201cFast Cleaner\u201d which is supposedly meant to clear junk, increase device speed and optimize battery. In reality, however, the app is only a means by which the Xenomorph Trojan could be propagated easily and efficiently.\n\n\u2018To avoid early detection or being denied access to the PlayStore, \u201cFast Cleaner\u201d was disseminated before the malware was placed on the remote server, making it hard for Google to determine that such an app is being used for malicious actions.\n\n\u2018Once up and running on a victim\u2019s device, Xenomorph can harvest device information and Short Messaging Service (SMS), intercept notifications and new SMS messages, perform overlay attacks, and prevent users from uninstalling it.

Considering that it can also intercept messages and notifications, it allows its operators to bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication and log into the victims\u2019 accounts without alerting them.\n\n\u2018Xenomorph has been found to target 56 internet banking apps, 28 from Spain, 12 from Italy, 9 from Belgium, and 7 from Portugal, as well as Cryptocurrency wallets and general-purpose applications like emailing services.

          "text": "\u2022PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum hail Buhari for signing electoral law\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nFollowing the signing of the new electoral bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday released a new timetable for the 2023 elections, with the conduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them now scheduled for April 4, 2022, to June 3, 2022.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nUnder the new timetable for the 2023 general election, INEC has shifted the presidential and National Assembly elections from February 18 to February 25, 2023, while the governorship elections will hold on March 11, 2023.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said the presidential and National Assembly elections would now hold on February 25 next year instead of the earlier announced date of February 18.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 general election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday, February 25, 2023, while the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday, March 11, 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 general election is now 363 days away,\u201d he explained.\n\nYakubu disclosed that under the law, there are critical time-bound activities from the publication of notice of election to the conduct of polls, which form the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for elections.\n\nAccording to him, some of the critical activities and their dates of implementation are as follows: \u201cPublication of Notice of Election \u2013 Monday, February 28, 2022;\n\n\u201cConduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them \u2013 Monday, April 4, 2022, to Friday, June 3, 2022.\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for Presidential and National Assembly election \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, June 10, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, June 17, 2022;\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, July 1, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, July 15, 2022;\n\n\u201cCommencement of campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections -Wednesday, September 28, 2022; commencement of campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 Wednesday, October 12, 2022; last day of the campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, February 23, 2023; last day of the campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, March 9, 2023,\u201d Yakubu further explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman stated explained that the Notice of Election would be published in INEC offices in all the states of the Federation as required by law on Monday, February 28, 2022.\n\nYakubu said that with the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, the commission would work assiduously to conclude and publish new Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections that are consistent with the Act.\n\n\u201cThese Regulations and Guidelines, as well as Manuals issued by the Commission, are all part of the legal regulatory framework for elections.\n\n\u201cTheir timely publication will enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to become conversant with their provisions as they prepare for the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe INEC chairman, who described the new electoral law as historic said that it was because it was the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 that the Electoral Act was repealed and re-enacted.\n\nHe explained that the 1998 \u2013 1999 elections were administered by transitional decrees until the 2001 Electoral Act was passed into law.\n\nThen, he said, the Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Electoral Act 2002 which was in turn repealed and re-enacted in 2006, 2010 and now we have the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nHe said that in 2017, the commission decided to establish fixed dates for general elections in Nigeria, explaining that the decision was based on INEC\u2019s determination to create certainty in the electoral calendar and to enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to prepare adequately for elections.\n\n\u201cBy that decision, presidential and National Assembly elections shall hold on the third Saturday of February of each general election year, while governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections shall follow two weeks later,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the 2023 general election was initially scheduled to commence on February 18, 2023, with the presidential and National Assembly elections, followed by the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections on March 4, 2023.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that the Commission could not release the detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election, as it normally would, because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nWith the bill now being signed into law, therefore, he said, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), form the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria.\n\nIn particular, he said that the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the general election.\n\n\u201cOne of the significant timelines is the publication of Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election, which has now lapsed,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded stakeholders, especially the political parties, of their responsibility to adhere strictly to the timelines in this Timetable and Schedule of Activities, as well as all other timelines established by the commission.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary that all political parties comply with the extant legal framework, ensure proper organisation and management of party primaries and the nomination of qualified candidates to prevent unnecessary litigations and rancour,\u201d Yakubu told all shareholders.\n\nSpeaking on the capacity of INEC to transmit all elections results in real-time, Yakubu said that from the reports available to the commission and its independent assessment INEC can transmit elections results to all the 774 local government areas and the 120,000 polling wards across the Federation.\n\nOn the BVAS, the INEC cha\u00ecrman said so far in the six by-elections in Ondo, Imo, Plateau and Cross Rivers states that there were no complaints against its operations\n\nHe pointed out the commission is not anticipating any extra budget to implement the new electoral law.\n\nPANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum Hail Buhari for Signing Electoral Law\n\nMeanwhile, the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; PANDEF and the MBF have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonna, told THISDAY yesterday that it was a welcome development that the president finally signed the bill into law.\n\nHe, therefore, challenged the INEC to ensure that nothing jeopardises the credibility of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe president had assured Nigerians that he will leave an improved electoral system by the time he serves out his tenure and we are glad that today, we now have an Electoral Act that substantially captures the key ingredients of a working, responsible and responsive democracy.\n\n\u201cThe President and National Assembly members have done their parts; it is now left for INEC to deliver. Let them know clearly that there\u2019s no room for excuses any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman however declared that the law would not completely remove malpractices from the nation\u2019s electoral system, explaining that the political actors would always seek ways of circumventing the system in their desperation for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had laws and the politicians know about that. One clear thing is that the malpractices are induced by the political elites. They will always find ways of achieving their plans. We are however hopeful that the situation will be appreciably reduced,\u201d he added.\n\nOn its part, PANDEF has also applauded President Buhari for signing into law the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe Forum, in a formal reaction by the spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, also called on the INEC to ensure the full implementation of the new electoral law.\n\nDescribing the president\u2019s assent to the bill as a welcome development after all the dilly-dally, Robinson said the action was perhaps the best thing President Buhari has done in terms of strengthening the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the National Assembly both deserve commendation. The ball is now in the court of the electoral commission to ensure that the Act is implemented to the letter in the entire electoral process, with adherence to every detail, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu, has also congratulated President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act into law, describing it as a welcome development.\n\nHe said Nigerians yearned to have a process that would translate to a transparent election that every Nigerian would trust.\n\nThe page however said it was not yet over, pointing out that INEC would need to do more to complement what the President has done, and ensure a credible election.\n\n\u201cWe welcome and congratulate Mr President for signing the Electoral Act into law.\n\n\u201cHaving signed, the job is not over yet, because we would want a two-stage transmission of results. First, INEC must ensure that in an election, the figures of accredited voters are first transmitted from the polling unit before the result of the election. This is to ensure that the figures of election results do not exceed the figures of accredited voters.\n\n\u201cIf that is not done, we are back to square one. The riggers out there will manipulate the system by writing the results at the polling units and asking the electoral officers to transmit what they have written. But if the accredited voters\u2019 figures are transmitted first, that will be difficult because the figure\u2019s results cannot be bloated above the accredited voters\u2019 figures.\n\n\u201cStage two is for the election results to be transmitted from the polling unit; these results must tally with figures of accredited voters in that polling unit.\n\nSo, we are calling on the National Assembly and INEC to ensure that this two-stage process is adhered to, to have a transparent and credible election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Aggregate money supply rises to N44.56tn\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nIn line with the resolve of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to halt a regime of arbitrage in the foreign exchange market, some Nigerian banks have started exposing the identities of customers, who allegedly obtained dollars by false pretence, and traded them at a profit in the parallel market.\n\nThis is coming as the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nSome bank customers have been taking advantage of the lucrative 37 per cent differential between the official and black market exchange rates by obtaining the dollar at the official rate of about N416, only to subsequently sell in the unauthorised market at a more expensive average rate of about N570.\n\nThese customers can beat regulations by presenting false travel documents, prompting the apex bank to direct banks to notify their customers of an impending crackdown on saboteurs in the forex market.\n\nHowever, a report by Bloomberg yesterday revealed that some banks have begun to implement the CBN\u2019s directives by publishing the names of clients found to have filed suspicious claims for forex transactions on their websites last week.\n\nFor instance, Zenith Bank Plc, the nation\u2019s biggest lender by market value, has published 987 names of customers engaging in the illegal practice on its website, Fidelity Bank Plc identified 83 customers; First City Monument Bank Plc listed eight names so far, while Wema Bank published one name. The list of banks that complied also included the United Bank for Africa Plc.\n\nThe apex bank had directed banks to identify such customers and ensure they refund the hard currency. The regulator first alerted banks of the ongoing practice last year.\n\nThe CBN had said: \u201cConsequently, further to the various measures already put in place, all banks are hereby directed to publish on their websites the names and BVN of defaulting customers who present fake travel documents or cancel their tickets and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed by them.\u201d\n\nSome deposit money banks acting on the directive of the CBN had sent notices to their customers warning that identities and Bank Verification Number (BVN) of those who contravene the apex bank\u2019s new forex policy on overseas personal and business travels would be published.\n\nThe CBN had also directed that travellers who buy foreign exchange from banks for travel purposes but fail to embark on the trip after two weeks of their scheduled travel date must return the forex to the banks.\n\nThe banks in their notices also pointed out consequences for those customers who engage in fraudulent and unethical practices with regards to the purchase of Personal Travel Allowances (PTA) and Business Travel Allowances (BTA).\n\nIn its notice to customers, one of the Tier 1 banks had said: \u201cWe have been directed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to inform all our customers that unethical practices to circumvent the new CBN policy on the sale of forex, such as the presentation of false travel documents, visas, and the cancellation of flight tickets, after purchasing personal travel allowance and business travel allowance, will no longer be tolerated.\n\n\u201cDefaulting customers who present fraudulent travel credentials or cancel their tickets and fail to refund the purchased PTA and BTA within two weeks, as stated in the signed customer declaration form, will have their identities and bank verification numbers published.\n\n\u201cWe aim to implement this policy immediately as an organisation that is fully compliant with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cOur bank is committed to partnering with the CBN to ensure a transparent, efficient and stable FX Market that meets the needs of all legitimate users.\u201d\n\nAggregate Money Supply Rises to N44.56tn in January\n\nMeanwhile, the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nA recently released Depository Corporations Survey by the apex bank, quoted by Cowry Asset Management Limited, showed that the growth was driven by a 1.46 per cent increase in M2 to N44.46 trillion and a sharp increase in CBN bills to N107.38 billion, from N100 million in the preceding month) amid efforts to rein in surplus liquidity.\n\nM2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and is easily convertible near money\n\nHowever, analysts from Cowry Asset Management Limited noted that the growth in central bank bills also came with its cost implications, as well as increased indebtedness of the apex bank.\n\nAccording to the latest edition of Cowry Financial Markets Review, Outlook & Recommended Stocks, growth in Broad Money supply was on the back of increases in Quasi Money (consisting of time deposits, near-maturing securities, foreign currencies, etc) and Narrow Money or M1 Money (comprising demand deposits and currency outside banks) by 0.34 per cent and 3.03 per cent to N25.74 trillion and N18.72 trillion, respectively.\n\n\u201cIncreases in quasi money may not be unconnected to, among other things, growing appetite of pension funds administrators to place retirement savings with commercial banks at relatively attractive interest rates. \u201cAs reported in the February 11, 2022 edition of our CWR, we observed that money moved out of T-bills securities to Local Money Market Securities (LMMS), especially bank placements,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt noted that the total funds invested in this investment category rose by 20.04 per cent to N2.03 trillion in December 2021 (lifting its share of the total assets to 15.09 per cent), from N1.69 trillion in December 2020 (or 13.71 per cent of total assets).\n\nThe CBN document was quoted as saying that that Reserve Money rose by 2.36 per cent to N13.61 trillion as bank reserves with the Central Bank increased by 3.51 per cent to N10.32 trillion (partly in tandem with increased deposits at the banks), to partly offset by a 5.52 per cent decline in currency outside banks to N2.78 trillion.\n\nOn the asset side, Net Domestic Credit grew by 2.49 per cent to N49.73 trillion as Credit to the Private Sector upped by 0.73 per cent to N35.45 trillion while Credit to the Government increased by 7.13 per cent to N14.28 trillion. However, Net Foreign Assets moderated by 1.79 per cent amid pressures on Nigeria\u2019s foreign sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowry Assets analysts have warned that the rise in the Narrow Money without a faster rise in GDP may result in higher inflation in 2022.\n\nIt noted that in 2021, the velocity of Narrow Money moderated to 10.16 times from 11.49 times in the preceding year even though Narrow Money rose by 14 per cent over the period, saying the productivity of the country needs a lot of improvement going forward.\n\nThe report warned that the escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and the attendant instability in the global oil market will exert pressure on the nation\u2019s external reserves.\n\nIt said: \u201cMeanwhile, in the wake of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, we are concerned that Nigeria would not optimally benefit from any ensuing rise in crude oil prices due to its suboptimal crude oil production. This would increase pressure on the external reserves as well as exchange rates as oil dollar revenues, its primary foreign currency earner, would struggle to meet the higher cost of imported refined products in addition to other imports.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Seplat Explains Acquisition of ExxonMobil Assets",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nSeplat Energy has defended its acquisition of oil assets belonging to Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), in the face of global resistance to fossil fuels, explaining that it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported that the oil company was set to buy off oil and gas assets belonging to the International Oil Company (IOC) in a deal that could cost up to $1.2 billion, seen as the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari last year.\n\nIn addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement will see the company acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration, encompassing the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual interaction with journalists, Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy, Mr Roger Brown, argued that given the pillars upon which the future of the company is hinged, it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.\n\nHe added that Seplat already set up a subsidiary called Seplat Energy offshore limited that would be acquiring the business of MPNU.\n\nHe explained that employees of the selling company as well as all the existing contracts will be maintained, stating that the intention is to continue to run the assets profitably, since, according to him, they are already well managed.\n\nBut the Seplat CEO stated that the deal will still have to go through the statutory processes, including the competition commission and the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NURPC) as well as obtaining the consent of the minister of petroleum.\n\nHe noted that Seplat would continue the \u201cexcellent performance\u201d of the Mobil business, adding that the new entity has a slightly different plan in terms of cost-efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe do look for cost efficiencies. Our decision-making time, I think it\u2019s faster. Normally as compared to oil majors, that\u2019s what independents are there to do.\n\n\u201cAnd we are looking for operational efficiencies as well as cost reduction where we can touch on operating cost. We\u2019ve been successful in doing that in other existing businesses. And again over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in costs and losses in Seplat.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our strategy, which we laid in July last year, we set it out deliberately on three pillars. We have pillar one, which is our upstream oil and gas, business and pillar two business is the midstream gas business, going down into gas power.\n\n\u201c We made a decision before to look at the power opportunities and then our new energy, the bridge into renewable energy. That strategy has not changed.\n\n\u201cBut when we look at that strategy, if you look at the world today, the world today is going towards lower carbon, sort of wealthier countries in the world moving towards net-zero targets,\u201d he posited.\n\nDescribing gas as a transition fuel, Roger explained that the federal government was right when it declared a decade of gas recently.\n\nHe explained that the upstream gas will supply the company\u2019s midstream business in terms of oil, arguing that prices are likely to go into the much-expected supercycle given the lack of investment and the geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s important to efficiently get it (oil) out of the ground and then sell it and get these dollars to reinvest back into Nigeria to ensure that we\u2019re addressing other businesses.\n\n\u201cSo without the oil today, you don\u2019t have money to ensure you have a transition. And therefore, this transaction, what it does do is a big production. Its production will double what Seplat has today. So this short cycle production allows us to monetise it, and reinvest in other businesses,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe expressed confidence that contrary to the belief in certain quarters, fossil fuels will not go into extinction shortly, adding that stakeholders were beginning to realise that in the long run, any attempt to leave fossil fuels behind will lead to higher fuel prices.\n\nOil Prices Recede After Week\u2019s Peak of $105 Per Barrel\n\nMeanwhile, crude oil prices slipped yesterday, the last day of transaction for the week, after it went on overdrive a day earlier on the back of the Russia-Ukraine face-off.\n\nThe crude oil price had surged above $105 per barrel for the first time since 2014 after Russia attacked sites across Ukraine.\n\nThe situation signalled the worsening of an already tightening global supply market.\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an international group of oil producers, was already struggling to meet its production target before the latest threat.\n\nRussia is the world\u2019s third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter and any impact on its production could markedly affect the market.\n\nIt is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe, providing over 35 per cent of its supply.\n\nBrent was up about six per cent on the day, paring gains after surging as much as 9.2 per cent to $105.79 a barrel after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe United States benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also briefly topped $100 a barrel before easing off of gains.\n\nBut on the last day of trading, the April Brent crude futures contract was down $1.06, or 1.1 per cent, at $98.02 per barrel in the afternoon after climbing as high as $101.99 per barrel. The active May contract shed 64 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $94.78.\n\nIn addition, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), United States crude, was down 31 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $92.50 a barrel, after hitting a session high of $95.64.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had caused prices to surge, with the assault seen as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the ill-treatment being meted out to Nigerian nationals, and citizens of other African countries in Ukraine amid the ongoing war in the country.\n\nGarba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity) in a statement on Sunday said the Presidency understands the pain and fear confronting all people who find themselves in the middle of the crisis.\n\nThere have been reports, along with videos of Nigerians being turned back at Ukraine's borders in their attempt to exit the troubled country for neighbouring ones.\n\nThe Presidency said it is aware of the situation, in the statement.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhile efforts to begin talks between Russia and Ukraine are underway, paramount on our minds is the safety and human rights of some four thousand Nigerian citizens and many others from friendly African nations today stranded in Ukraine. See Also News How Nigerian Students Stranded In Ukraine, With Barely Enough Food Or Money Were Victimised, Robbed By Their Hosts\n\n\u201cThere is a long history dating back to decades of Nigerians and other Africans studying in Ukraine, particularly medicine. The majority of Nigerian citizens in the country today are university-enrolled students.\n\n\u201cFrom video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with their wards and/or Nigerian consular officials there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border.\n\n\u201cIn one video widely circulating on social media, a Nigerian mother with her young baby was filmed being physically forced to give up her seat to another person.\n\n\u201cThere are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens\u2019 entry into Poland from Ukraine. See Also International Russian Invasion: Some Nigerians, Others With Expired Documents Kept In Camps In Ukraine, Not Allowed To Leave\n\n\u201cOne group of Nigerian students having been repeatedly refused entry into Poland have concluded they have no choice but to travel again across Ukraine and attempt to exit the country via the border with Hungary.\n\n\u201cWe understand the pain and fear that is confronting all people who find themselves in this terrifying place.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected. See Also International Russian Invasion: How Nigerians Narrowly Escaped Being Burnt In Ukraine\n\n\u201cBut, for that reason, it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour.\n\n\u201cAll who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are proud of those educated in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities and centres of learning who have returned to Nigeria to perform great service for our nation and our people.\n\n\u201cWithout the generosity of spirit of the Ukrainian people that would never have been possible.\n\n\u201cWe pray for those directly affected by this conflict.\n\n\u201cNigeria, with our 200 million people, support all and every diplomatic effort to bring this war to an end.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the ill-treatment being meted out to Nigerian nationals, and citizens of other African countries in Ukraine amid the ongoing war in the country.\n\nGarba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity) in a statement on Sunday said the Presidency understands the pain and fear confronting all people who find themselves in the middle of the crisis.\n\nThere have been reports, along with videos of Nigerians being turned back at Ukraine's borders in their attempt to exit the troubled country for neighbouring ones.\n\nThe Presidency said it is aware of the situation, in the statement.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhile efforts to begin talks between Russia and Ukraine are underway, paramount on our minds is the safety and human rights of some four thousand Nigerian citizens and many others from friendly African nations today stranded in Ukraine. See Also News How Nigerian Students Stranded In Ukraine, With Barely Enough Food Or Money Were Victimised, Robbed By Their Hosts\n\n\u201cThere is a long history dating back to decades of Nigerians and other Africans studying in Ukraine, particularly medicine. The majority of Nigerian citizens in the country today are university-enrolled students.\n\n\u201cFrom video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with their wards and/or Nigerian consular officials there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border.\n\n\u201cIn one video widely circulating on social media, a Nigerian mother with her young baby was filmed being physically forced to give up her seat to another person.\n\n\u201cThere are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens\u2019 entry into Poland from Ukraine. See Also International Russian Invasion: Some Nigerians, Others With Expired Documents Kept In Camps In Ukraine, Not Allowed To Leave\n\n\u201cOne group of Nigerian students having been repeatedly refused entry into Poland have concluded they have no choice but to travel again across Ukraine and attempt to exit the country via the border with Hungary.\n\n\u201cWe understand the pain and fear that is confronting all people who find themselves in this terrifying place.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected. See Also International Russian Invasion: How Nigerians Narrowly Escaped Being Burnt In Ukraine\n\n\u201cBut, for that reason, it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour.\n\n\u201cAll who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are proud of those educated in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities and centres of learning who have returned to Nigeria to perform great service for our nation and our people.\n\n\u201cWithout the generosity of spirit of the Ukrainian people that would never have been possible.\n\n\u201cWe pray for those directly affected by this conflict.\n\n\u201cNigeria, with our 200 million people, support all and every diplomatic effort to bring this war to an end.\u201d",

We have also prioritised police investigations and environmental damage assessment,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cWe have kept up the search and rescue efforts, with the collaboration of the Police, NUPRC, NIMASA, NOSDRA, Marine Police, the communities, and local fishermen. The community leaders and traditional rulers have also been of great support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been in regular contact with the three survivors and their family members and ensured that all three received appropriate medical care in hospital. They have all been discharged from the hospital and the company has continuously offered support with any post-trauma care that may be required.\n\n\u201cSo far, a total of five bodies have been found on and around the FPSO.

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenyan influencers were paid $10 to $15 to discredit controversial bills on Twitter",
          "text": "In the past 3 years, the Kenyan parliament has discussed two pieces of health legislation that has sparked online debates. The bills are the Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, also known as the Surrogacy Bill.\n\nAccording to a new report by Mozilla Foundation, Kenyans\u2019 conversations on Twitter on these health bills have been manipulated by disinformation campaigns sponsored by an anti-choice Spanish advocacy group, CitizenGO. The report shows that CitizenGO, a group that has been linked to the Spanish far-right, by exploiting the Twitter Trends algorithm, was able to input itself in these conversations in an attempt to influence debates around health bills.\n\nAccording to briefs seen by the researchers of the report, the messages the campaign used to attack activists contained cartoon caricatures and memes that echo messaging by American and European right-wing groups.\n\nThe Reproductive Healthcare Bill was introduced to the parliament in 2020 and is supposed to outlaw forced sterilisations; make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free and provide rights to reproductive healthcare services to every woman in Kenya, including adolescents. In 2021, the Surrogacy Bill proposed Kenyan politicians should develop standards and regulations around surrogacy\u2014an arrangement where a woman (a surrogate mother) carries a child in her belly on behalf of another woman, who receives the child after birth.\n\nOdanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation based in Nairobi, reviewed content posted between 2019 and 2021 and discovered that CitizenGo, and accounts linked to it, had tweeted 20,811 times and engaged in 11 campaigns\u2014when a large number of accounts tweeting using a predetermined hashtag or keyword. 10 of these problematic campaigns made it to the Trend section.\n\nThe Mozilla report reveals that CitizenGO paid the owner of these accounts or \u201cdisinformation influencers\u201d around $10 to $15 to make tailored tweets that discredited the bills.\n\nThe campaign made multiple false and misleading claims about surrogacy and reproductive health. For example, a tweet in the campaign claimed that children of surrogates display behavioural and emotional issues\u2014a claim the report revealed the African Population Health Research Center (APHRC) had debunked. Those tweets went on to attack journalists, activists and politicians that advocated for reproductive rights or the two reproductive bills.\n\nIn response to this report, Twitter has permanently suspended 240 accounts connected to this disinformation campaign for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.\n\nA booming disinformation industry\n\nLast year, Madung and Brian Obilo, another Mozilla fellow, discovered, through a series of interviews with social media influencers who coordinated disinformation attacks, were responsible for spreading the hashtag #AnarchistJudges. The tweets under this hashtag, which trended countrywide, cast suspicion on the competence and integrity of court officials that were against the Constitutional Amendments Bill of 2021 in Kenya.\n\nLike this campaign, it was also coordinated through WhatsApp and social media influencers were paid between 10$ to 15$ per campaign to tweet predetermined malicious tweets.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation report noted that the campaign had all the patterns of a disinformation campaign: heavy repetition of content under hashtags, newly created accounts tweeting political content, synchronised posting period and false tweets.\n\nHeightening Twitter Trend\u2019s criticism\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trends section helps users identify the most discussed topics on the platform and also help them find popular information or discussion. They vary depending on geographical location and personal interest.\n\nBut the feature has come under fire multiple times over the years for spreading hate and disinformation, and at some point, external critics and Twitter employees suggested eradicating the feature altogether, after it struggled to deal with disinformation around the US presidential election. One of Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up the feature was by adding more context to trending topics.\n\nMadung expressed concerns about the potential influence of these disinformation actors in the upcoming Kenya election: \u201cHealth is a political issue & more so reproductive health. As we mentioned in the report, there\u2019s clear evidence that these groups will be looking to exert their influence on candidates and citizens to ultimately affect the ballot in favour of candidates that agree with them.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that Twitter should assess individual countries and map out how the Trends section can be used to push disinformation; establish collaborations with local researchers, and develop a transparent partnership with fact-checkers and civil societies, all of whom can offer context about the region. Last year, Twitter was forced to disable the Trends feature in Ethiopia as it was increasingly used to push by warring parties to spread hate campaigns. By the way, researchers could not find any tangible impact of this intervention on the subsequent volume of hate speech on the platform.\n\nLast year, a Buzzfeed investigation revealed that Nigerian influencers paid to tweet in a coordinated manner successfully manipulated Twitter Trends in order to sway public opinion and court judgement in favour of Venezuelan politician, Alex Saab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to manipulate (content) in jurisdictions such as ours where the volume of content is not as high as countries such as the US,\u201d Madung tells TechCabal. With African countries increasingly vulnerable to disinformation actors on Twitter, a collaborative effort between Twitter, policymakers, civil societies and media organisations will be crucial to keep online discourse saner and difficult to manipulate.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Meet the 19 year old Nigerian building his own blockchain empire",
          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway.\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited him home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. But I made a deployment error that cost the company $10,000.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after announcing its Series D round that sent its valuation over the $3 billion mark, African fintech startup, Flutterwave, at a virtual event, announced additional services to its existing offering. In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRussian military activity in eastern Ukraine has increased recently, with threats of a larger invasion looming. Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, has unequivocally stated that Ukraine has no historical claim to independence; on Monday, February 21, 2022, he said that modern Ukraine was \u201centirely created by Russia.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, potentially igniting a European war over Russia\u2019s demands for an end to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) eastward expansion.\n\nBut what could have caused the conflict? While tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, had existed for some time, the situation began to spiral out of control in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged US president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to join NATO in January of last year. This infuriated Russia, which began sending troops near its Ukrainian border for \u201ctraining exercises\u201d and increased the number of troops sent in 2021.\n\nSadly, 14,000 people have died in Ukraine since 2014; I\u2019m sure many more will perish if caution is not exercised. Plus, I think this conflict has the potential to spark World War III. Do you think so? Leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) data protection laws have long been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d globally. Nonetheless, because technology has changed our lives in ways no one could have predicted in the last 25 years, the rules must be rewritten.\n\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, one of its most significant achievements in recent years. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, enacted when the Internet was in its infancy.\n\nAnd over the last four years, some progress has been made in protecting personal data since the GDPR was implemented.\n\nLarge technology companies have come under intense scrutiny. Due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing, they have had to backtrack and seek ways to protect user privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Facebook and Google are under increasing pressure to better balance privacy and ad targeting, with their fortunes on the line as users revolt, regulators loom, and Apple seizes the opportunity to improve its image.\n\nPer Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free as of December 2021; that figure is 94% on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut is Apple more secure than Google in terms of privacy?\n\nResearch shows that an iPhone or an Android device constantly sends data to Apple or Google, including your location, phone number, and local network details.\n\nSo, how do Google and Apple strike a balance between privacy concerns and profit motives? In the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo covered and provided more insight into this.\n\nPlease read the article here, The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022, and explosions have been reported in the country\u2019s east.\n\nWhy should you care? The cryptocurrency market has fallen sharply as the war in Ukraine escalated, with missiles continuing to pour down on the country\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and its airport being captured by airborne troops.\n\nThe missile reports have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, causing a selling hysteria that has resulted in a loss of nearly $500 million in liquidations for the entire crypto market as of the time of writing.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, $462.91 million in cryptocurrency has been \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 financially lost \u2013 since two nights ago, Wednesday, February 23, 2022. Also, the crypto market is down more than 10%, as many altcoins have suffered significant losses.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order occurred on Bitfinex, where LINK \u2013 an Ethereum token \u2013 worth $3.21 million was liquidated. During the sell-off, Bitcoin and Ethereum lost $129.95 million and $116.68 million, respectively.\n\nRecall that the flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s stock markets experienced a \u201cbloodbath\u201d at the start of the trading session on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe crash occurred as investors reacted to Western governments\u2019 promised sanctions in response to Putin\u2019s shocking announcement that Russia had launched military action against Ukraine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow Do We Take Care of Our Mental Health at Work?

          "text": "In race to attract Nigerian students, US losing ground to UK\n\nThe United States of America may be fast losing ground to the United Kingdom as the preferred study destination, BusinessDay\u2019s analysis of new enrolment data shows.\n\nData sourced from the Institute of International Education (IIE) indicate that the overall Nigerian students\u2019 enrolment from Nigeria to the United States declined year-on-year by 7.2 percent to 12,860 in the 2020/21 academic year from 13,762 in 2019/2020.\n\nHowever, enrolment increased by 63.5 percent to 21,305 in the same period from 13,020 for the United Kingdom, according to data sourced from the country\u2019s Higher Education Statistics Agency.\n\nIn Australia, the number of Nigerian students dropped by 5.6 percent to 1,928 in 2021.\n\nExperts say that the expanded work and immigration opportunities offered in the UK have become major drivers for international student enrolment in UK higher education.\n\n\u201cBritish independent schools, especially private boarding schools, view Nigeria as an increasingly attractive market. Most of them warmly welcome Nigerian students,\u201d Matthew Page, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a recent article titled \u2018West African Elites\u2019 Spending on UK Schools and Universities: A Closer Look\u2019.\n\nPage also said that they overwhelmingly see these students as better-than-average performers and net contributors.\n\nLabour is seen as an important asset to the growth and development of any economy. But the UK, one of the top developed economies in the world, is currently facing an acute shortage of labour due to its aging population and low birth rate.\n\nThis has led to the demand for labour from countries with large youth populations and expanding middle class including India, Brazil, Nigeria, among others.\n\nOne of the measures that the developed economy took was to update its International Education Strategy, which was originally launched in 2019.\n\nThe strategy commits to previously established goals for foreign enrolment growth, which have been replaced by new immigration routes and work opportunities for foreign students. It intends to create clearer pathways to immigration.\n\nThe update reaffirms the government\u2019s goals of increasing the value of its education exports to \u00a335 billion ($48bn) and to hosting at least 600,000 international students per year by 2030.\n\nSome of the ways in which this growth is to be achieved are the Graduate route, which was launched in July 2021, will allow eligible students to stay in the UK to work, or look for work, for 2 years (3 years if studying at Ph.D. level) after they have completed a degree in the UK.\n\n\u201cThis Strategy released in a post-Brexit context in which non-European markets are ever-more important for British educators lists Nigeria as a priority recruitment market,\u201d ICEF, an international recruitment agency said.\n\nAdditionally, Olugbenga Ogunbode, CEO at International Education Corporation Group, said the UK exit from Brexit created job vacancies at the middle and low levels.\n\n\u201cSo, they need to fill those positions and Nigerians are usually the ones that fill those areas,\u201d he further said.\n\nBefore the education strategy was updated, the UK saw its international student numbers grow relatively slowly as a result of more migration restrictive policies.\n\nRead also: Nigerian students studying in UK surge by 64% in one year\n\nFor Nigeria, the number declined from 18,080 in the 2014/2015 academic year to 10,685 in 2017/2018 but it continued to rise to 21,305.\n\nSteve Smith, UK\u2019s first-ever International Education Champion said in the strategy update that he will work closely with overseas governments and officials to deepen government-to-government partnerships, helping to open new international opportunities for the sector and working to resolve market access barriers in priority markets.\n\nThose markets are India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, and Nigeria, with Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Europe, China, and Hong Kong also spotlighted as priorities.\n\nThe UK\u2019s drive towards attracting labour may be good for its economy but it is bad for Africa\u2019s biggest economy, as it is already causing a brain drain exodus.\n\nThe reasons for Nigeria\u2019s persistent brain drain are not hard to diagnose. High poverty, unemployment, poor human capital development, insecurity, and poor education are some of the many reasons its young people are leaving the country to greener pastures.\n\nA recent survey by the World Bank, 50 percent of Nigerian youths want to leave the country. The country placed third in West Africa among the nations polled, trailing only Liberia (70 percent) and Sierra Leone (60%).\n\n\u201cThe country is the biggest loser here because we are losing our best brains to the UK. We need to keep our young and agile population rather than losing them to a new form of slavery,\u201d Ogunbode said.",

          "title": "Electoral Act: Nigeria on the march to credible election in 2023?",
          "text": "Beyond the signing into law Friday of the Amended Electoral Act by President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerians have been urged to prepare for credible elections, henceforth.\n\nThe development may have also shifted pressure on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as there should be no more excuses from the electoral umpire.\n\nWhile many Nigerians have also commended the President for giving his assent to the Bill, some others also have said he was deserving of applause as he, not only delayed the signing, but has also carried himself in a manner that suggested he had an ulterior motives.\n\nCommending the President on his verified twitter account, Atedo Peterside, an investment banker and founder of ANAP Foundation, said: \u201cThank you @MBuhari for signing into law an Electoral Act that constitutes a significant improvement over previous legislation. The #GoNigeria movement wishes to thank Mr. President, our legislators, Civil Society, etc. for this team effort.\u201d\n\nBut Governor Nyesom Wike alleged that the president was \u2018selfish and not altruistic.\u2019\n\nWike\u2019s outburst followed the President\u2019s complaint about Section 84(12) of the amended Act while he was signing the document.\n\nThe governor said if Buhari truly believed in transparent election and that everybody should have a level playing ground, he would not be suggesting the amendment of the section which he claims will disenfranchise serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at conventions or congresses of any political party.\n\nThe signing of the document has evoked new optimism among Nigerians toward the electoral process.\n\nAcross the country, the general feeling is that perhaps, with the development some of the drawbacks that had undermined the electoral process in the country over the years could be checked. Presently, all eyes are now on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to accelerate preparations for next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe Electoral Act provides for the structure of INEC, its powers and guidelines for registering voters, procedures for the conduct of elections, the registration and regulation of political parties, electoral offences and the determination of electoral offences.\n\nWith the improvements and clauses in place, in section 49 of the Electoral Act, hope rises for free, fair, credible and acceptable elections in Nigeria as challenges such as manual calculation and transmission of results are now addressed.\n\nHowever, the 2023 general election is going to serve as a litmus test for the Amended Electoral Act Manual as the Nigeria electorate awaits its practicability, and not ready for any excuse from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on inconclusive or rigged elections.\n\nBut as hope is rising as the new development seems, concerned citizens and political observers think that is a major hurdle crossed, while practicability may be the challenge.\n\nUpon the return of Nigeria to civil rule in 1999, the first Electoral Act was passed in 2001. This was revised in 2002, 2006 and 2010. Indeed, there has always been an attempt after every election to amend the Electoral Act to take care of deficiencies or mischief noticed during the elections.\n\nExperts say that in any democratic system, it is crucial that elections be free and fair, while an adequate legal framework has been recognised as a prerequisite for credible, free and fair elections.\n\nWith the Electoral Act now in place, it would be presumed that there is the right legislation to deal with some of the issues that had hindered the smooth conduct of credible polls in Nigeria.\n\nObservers say that INEC needs to do more to have a hitch-free outing next year, and part of the suggestions is that political offenders must be punished. They said that having legislation in place may not solve all the problems if there is no deliberate attempt to enforce some of the provisions.\n\n\u201cI think having the bill is the right step forward ahead 2023, it would sanitise a lot of things in our electoral process. If you look over the years this is what Nigerians have been clamouring for in view of the challenges we have.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, my concern is that we don\u2019t punish these people, how many election offenders face the law after the 2019 general elections. We have to make people face consequences of their action to serve as deterrence or else this would continue\u201d, Lanre Oyegbola, politician and public affairs analyst said.\n\nOyegbola stressed that if INEC and the federal government were interested in tackling voter apathy in the country, violence that had characterised elections in Nigeria must be checked.\n\n\u201cI have not read the bill but my point of worry also is that I noticed our elections are always ridiculed with violence, this even goes a long way to discourage a lot of eligible voters from coming out to vote on Election Day,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking in similar vein recently, Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, recently solicited for paradigm shift among political players, stressing that the Electoral Act alone could not guarantee free and fair election in Nigeria.\n\nOvie Omo-Agege, who was speaking through, Daniel Bwala, his Special Adviser on Legal and Constitutional Matters, said no matter how good the clauses were in the electoral laws, if the other aspects of the electioneering process were flawed, the electoral process itself will ultimately be flawed.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile there have been many more issues in our electoral history, it seems to me that if we have had adequate and unambiguous clauses, plus adequate advocacy, understanding and the will to comply, we would have had less controversies, fewer post-election court cases and generally, a more credible electoral process.\u201d\n\nKunle Okunola, political analyst blamed politicians for always trying to manipulate the system, despite regulation in their favour in collusion with INEC officials in a bid to be successful at the poll at all cost.\n\n\u201cI commend the President for signing, well we don\u2019t know what the plans of the politicians would be now ahead 2023, don\u2019t forget in a bid to win at all cost, politicians always find their way to break the law or work with officials to manipulate the system. I am sure they are looking for a way out now.\n\n\u201cThe question is; if INEC is ready to do the right thing? Would their officials not be compromised? We don\u2019t have a perfect system, I think the ball is in INEC\u2019s court now,\u201d Okunola said.\n\nExcited at the development, Chijioke Umelahi, a political aspirant and former lawmaker, is upbeat.\n\nBut he fears that political gladiators and those who want power by all means may likely find a way around it as INEC still has the biggest responsibility at ensuring the elections are credible.\n\n\u201cI have gone through the clauses and amendments introduced in section 49 of the Electoral Act. They are well-thought-out, and for the first time, putting the interest of the nation first, securing the electorates\u2019 votes, and jettisoning selfish politicians out of the election equation. But my fear is that the moneybags and corrupt politicians will find their way around it,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nAccording to the Abuja-based lawyer, the corrupt politicians and fear of losing out by some power blocs were the reasons the President delayed giving his assent to the bill to be passed into law, they knew the president will later give assent to it and they also have Plan B.\n\nHe fears that unforeseen emergencies or inconsistencies from the INEC, especially on the provision of adequate materials, logistics, staff issue, and other issues my hamper the gains of the Amended Electoral Act come 2023 and beyond.\n\nIn a divergent view, Amaye Bob-Manuel, a River State politician, disclosed that corrupt politicians will not have their way again as the amendment is encompassing and clear, making lawsuit almost impossible.\n\n\u201cWith the provisions of the Amended Electoral Act, the conduct of election, the results and transmission of the results are public, clear and captured in data, it will be difficult to rig, and even disqualifying a credible candidate after the polls,\u201d he explained.\n\nDispelling the fears of many that corruption will find its way in the elections despite the Amended Electoral Act, Bob-Manuel said that the Act provides for penalties as well and most importantly, it is the ground on which credible candidates can always fight for their mandates and reclaim them.\n\nWhere he thinks the challenge would be is in the intimidation of voters by security operatives and thugs.\n\n\u201cThe only think corrupt politicians can do is to make sure people do not come out to vote, but once the vote is cast, the Amended Act secures it and gives power back to the electorates whose votes now count,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian researcher in Belgium and concerned Nigerian in Diaspora, also thinks that while the Amended Electoral Act safeguards the votes and results, the electorates are not safe from intimidation by security agencies, which have been on increase since 2015.\n\n\u201cI think the politicians know they will not have their way again with the Act, but they will go for the jugular this time. For them now, it is a case of if I cannot rig in my state where I am unpopular or if my people see me as incredible, then, they will not come out to vote for their so-called credible candidate on Election Day,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: 2022 Electoral Bill: 10 things every Nigerian should know\n\nHe noted further that it would be interesting to see how INEC, judiciary, law enforcement agents and other stakeholders will put into practice the provisions of the Act in 2023.\n\nTo safeguard the electorates and ensure sustainability of credible elections in the country, Bob-Manuel, who decried being rigged out during the primaries of the House of Representatives election in Rivers State, suggested that an Electoral Offenders Commission should be set up with courts and trained judges to prosecute offenders.\n\n\u201cIf we prosecute electoral offenders as their case is hot, it will serve as a deterrent for others. Political tugs, security agents that intimidate electorates, INEC officials delay elections or compromise should be charged to the commission for immediate and open prosecution,\u201d he suggested.\n\nHowever, despite the optimism being expressed over the likelihood of credible elections on the back of the development last Friday, EnoughisEnough (EiE) a non-governmental and non-profit organisation that has been among the Civil Society Organisations pressuring the President to sign the Bill, noted that \u201cThere is only one way to change the narrative of incompetent leadership in Nigeria \u2013 register to vote. We cannot keep entrusting the delicate responsibility of electing leaders in the hands of a select few.\u201d\n\nNigerians have therefore, urged to prepare themselves to exercise their franchise as it is only by so doing that the Electoral Act would have achieved its desired purpose.",
          "summary": "Beyond the signing into law Friday of the Amended Electoral Act by President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerians have been urged to prepare for credible elections, henceforth.\nPresently, all eyes are now on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to accelerate preparations for next year\u2019s election.\nUpon the return of Nigeria to civil rule in 1999, the first Electoral Act was passed in 2001.\nIndeed, there has always been an attempt after every election to amend the Electoral Act to take care of deficiencies or mischief noticed during the elections.\n\u201cI have gone through the clauses and amendments introduced in section 49 of the Electoral Act.",

I was chased out of the country for three years. I worked with Chief Olu Falae, I was jailed. I have also worked with President Muhammad Buhari before things started turning upside down,\u201d he said\n\nSpeaking, the Olufi of Gbongan showered encomium on the presidential aspirant, promising to support his presidential ambition.\n\nIt would be recall that Momodu was among the Nigerian elites who strongly canvassed both online and offline against the 16 years rule of the PDP and the re-election bid of former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nHowever, Momodu recently registered his commitment to the PDP as well as his determination to stick to his ambition through to the end.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "COVID 19: 103.7m Nigerians Not Fully Vaccinated",
          "text": "Two years after the first case of COVID -19 was detected in Nigeria, 103,745,586 out of the 111,776,503 eligible population targeted for COVID-19 vaccination to reach herd immunity against the disease have not been fully vaccinated.\n\nThough vaccination against COVID-19 commenced about a year after, the huge gap between eligible Nigerians and those vaccinated shows that Nigerians are not willing to be vaccinated.\n\nThe National Primary Health Development Agency (NPHCDA) COVID-19 vaccination update in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as of February 25, 2020 shows that 17,646,781 of eligible persons targeted for vaccination have received the first dose while 8,030,917 of total eligible persons targeted have received the second dose (fully vaccinated).\n\nThis indicates 15.8 per cent and 7.3 per cent respectively, meaning that 84.2 per cent of the target population are yet to receive the first dose while 92.7 per cent are yet to take their second shot.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, experts have identified vaccine hesitancy as a main reason for the poor uptake. A professor from the department of pharmaceutical & medicinal chemistry, faculty of pharmaceutical sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Prof. Ikemefuna Uzochukwu, told LEADERSHIP Sunday that high COVID-19 hesitancy among Nigerians was attributed largely to safety and efficacy concerns, despite the approval of the vaccines by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).\n\nVaccines Production: 3 Nigerian Varsities Get WHO Certification\n\nLack of trust in the vaccine sources, vaccine developers, donors and the Nigerian government; vaccine development within one year; lack of rigorous safety testing; several conspiracy theories; possibility of receiving a fake vaccine; fears of adverse effects and events were the major drivers of the concerns, Uzochukwu said.\n\n\u201cOther reasons for the unwillingness of some Nigerians to be vaccinated include disbelief over the existence of COVID-19 in Nigeria; poor knowledge of the new technology platforms used in the design and development of COVID-19 vaccine; belief that other preventive measures are enough protection; belief that the body\u2019s immunity is strong enough against the virus; the vaccine not needed if one is not infected with the virus; COVID-19 can be easily treated with medicines such as chloroquine,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUzochukwu however recommended that appropriately designed advocacy and behaviour-change communication messages that target the respective segments of Nigerians should be deployed to minimise vaccine hesitancy in the country.\n\nTo improve vaccination in the country, Tomori said COVID-19 vaccine should be made compulsory for all Nigerians, adding that it would enable the country to achieve herd immunity by 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment should ensure that the COVID-19 vaccine is enough to go round. In addition, the government should create more awareness on the importance of the non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 measures,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSince there are enough vaccines for the eligible population, the government should make it compulsory, but before then, the government must sensitise the public on the importance of the vaccine, not just to them, but the country at large,\u201d he added.\n\nA few days ago, the minister of health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said the proportion of fully vaccinated Nigerians was still very low.\n\nHe partly blamed the use of two-dose vaccine on the low vaccination in the country, saying most people were reluctant to take their second dose for various reasons including fear of a repeat of the mild side effects they may have experienced with the first dose.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEhanire assured Nigerians of adequate stock of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, saying, \u201cWe have over 30 million doses in stock. I call on all eligible persons that are yet to receive their vaccination to go to the nearest COVID-19 vaccination site and get vaccinated. This single dose offers the same protection you get from two doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech and Moderna vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe minister also encouraged those who have received their first dose of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer vaccines to ensure they take their second dose when due, to be fully vaccinated and protected.\n\nHowever, in a contrary view, the head, pharmaceutical technology/nanomedicine, National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD), Prof. Martins Emeje, said the number of people that died from COVID-19 in Europe and America, cannot be compared to the number that died in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhich vaccines did we use that made us not to die? I am going to tell you the answer: no one. Does that not tell you that there is a vaccine in your own environment?\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria is not harnessing that local vaccine that protected us or doing more research to find out why Nigerians are not dying from the virus, despite the prediction by the western world and we are waiting for world leaders and international institutions to give us vaccine or wait for WHO to give us the go ahead to produce our own vaccine, then it shows that we are a brain lazy people,\u201d Emeje stated.\n\nHe, however, advocated that Nigeria needs to do more in research and development to produce locally medicines and vaccines for Nigerians, rather than wait for others to provide the country vaccines.",

The majority of Nigerian citizens in the country today are university-enrolled students.\n\n\u201cFrom video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with their wards and/or Nigerian consular officials there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border.\n\n\u201cIn one video widely circulating on social media, a Nigerian mother with her young baby was filmed being physically forced to give up her seat to another person.\n\n\u201cThere are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens\u2019 entry into Poland from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOne group of Nigerian students having been repeatedly refused entry into Poland have concluded they have no choice but to travel again across Ukraine and attempt to exit the country via the border with Hungary.\n\n\u201cWe understand the pain and fear that is confronting all people who find themselves in this terrifying place.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected.\n\n\u201cBut, for that reason, it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour.\n\n\u201cAll who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are proud of those educated in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities and centres of learning who have returned to Nigeria to perform great service for our nation and our people.\n\n\u201cWithout the generosity of spirit of the Ukrainian people that would never have been possible.\n\n\u201cWe pray for those directly affected by this conflict.\n\n\u201cNigeria, with our 200 million people, support all and every diplomatic effort to bring this war to an end.\u201d",

That was all. Nobody discussed any other position,\u201d a northern governor told TheCable.\n\n\u201cIf you noticed, nobody signed the list that is going round in the media. It was not attributed to anybody. Governor Nasir el-Rufai said the north and the south would swap positions, but the list is not even reflective of this.\n\n\u201cUnder a swap arrangement, the practice is north-east for south-east, north-west for south-west, and north-central for south-south, and vice-versa. That is why the chairman will come from north-central since it was south-south the last time out. And that is the only thing we have agreed so far.\u201d\n\nAn APC senator also faulted the zonal congresses scheduled for March 12.\n\n\u201cZonal congresses are alien to the current APC constitution.

Holding zonal congresses before the amended constitution is ratified amounts to illegality,\u201d he told TheCable.\n\nIt is understood that this will also be discussed by the APC governors at their meeting.\n\nThe convention was initially scheduled for February 26 but shifted by a month.\n\nGoing by the timetable for the 2023 general election, parties are expected to pick their legislative, governorship and presidential candidates by June 3, 2022.",

This is why Presiden Zelensky and President Lukashenko spoke today.\n\n\u201cWe have to defend our northern flank and we have to minimise the threats coming from there.\n\n\u201cSo we agreed to send a delegation to the location on the Ukranian-Belarus border and we go to there to listen to what Russia has to say.\u201d\n\nHe said diplomats will meet \u201cwithout preliminary agreement\u201d on what the outcome of the talks can be.\n\nWe are going there to say what we think of this war and Russia\u2019s actions,\u201d Kuleba added.\n\n\u201cI think the fact Russia wants to talk without any pre-conditions or any ultimatums, without any demands addressed to Ukraine, is already a victory for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nZelenskyy had earlier refused to negotiate in Belarus, but according to Kuleba, Belarus\u2019s president told him there would be \u201cno such move\u201d as long as the planned talks go ahead.\n\nIt comes after Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert just after warning the West \u201cmay face the greatest consequences in history\u201d.\n\nThe Russian tyrant is said to be \u201cfurious\u201d he\u2019s not been able to subdue Ukraine and lashed out at NATO for its \u201cunfriendly measures\u201d he says forced him into the chilling nuclear gamble\n\nThe move means Putin has ordered the world\u2019s largest stockpile of nuclear warheads prepared for launched readiness.\n\nThat raises the terrifying possibility the crisis and a miscalculation could spill over into nuclear war.\n\nIn an address on state TV, Putin claimed aggressive statements by NATO leaders and economic sanctions against Moscow have forced his hand.\n\nHe said \u201cnot only do Western countries take unfriendly measures\u201d such as \u201cillegal sanctions\u201d but \u201ctop officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country\u201d.\n\nPutin said he has now ordered his military command to put Russia\u2019s deterrence forces \u2013 a reference to units which include nuclear arms \u2013 on high alert.\n\n(TheSun)",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cover the failure to promptly and thoroughly probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999, and to ensure the prosecution of those suspected to be responsible\u201d.\n\nThe suit followed Buhari\u2019s 2022 New Year Message in which he raised concerns about \u201cthe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country,\u201d and his promise in his 2015 inaugural speech to \u201ccheck gross corruption and ensure that there is accountability at all levels of government in the country\u201d.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/189/2022, filed last week at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to direct Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to probe allegations of systemic mismanagement of security votes by state governors since 1999\u201d.\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to direct Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN) to prosecute anyone suspected to be responsible, as appropriate; if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to recover any mismanaged public funds\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Electoral Act] Buhari Institutionalising Credible Elections in Nigeria \u2013 APC\n\nIn the suit, SERAP is arguing that \u201cCompelling the Federal Government to probe the spending of security votes since 1999 would ensure accountability, and improve the ability of the government to deliver on the promises to ensure the security of Nigerians, and to keep them safe\u201d.\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application. Ending impunity for allegations of corruption in the spending of security votes and recovering any mismanaged public funds are matters of public interest\u201d.\n\nIt maintained that \u201cthe responsibility to guarantee and ensure the security and welfare of the Nigerian people is interlinked with the responsibility under Section 15(5) of the Nigerian Constitution, 1999 [as amended] to \u2018abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of office.\u2019 This imposes a fundamental obligation to ensure accountability for the spending of security votes by state governors\u201d.\n\nAlso, the agency said, \u201cThe government has the primary and constitutional responsibility to protect the lives and property of the Nigerian people. Section 14(2)(b) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that \u2018the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government\u2019\u201d.\n\nSERAP further said \u201cPervasive tendency by public officers since 1999 to regard or treat security votes given to them for [the] security of the state as their personal entitlement or funds is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution and international standards\u201d.\n\n\u201cSecurity votes should be used for improving the security situation in the states or returned to the public treasury,\u201d it added.\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondent is Mr Malami.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Joke Fekumo read in part: \u201cLongstanding allegations of mismanagement of security votes have hugely contributed to the growing insecurity in the country, and the failure to ensure the security and welfare of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs revealed by a recent report by Transparency International (TI), most of the funds appropriated as security votes are spent on political activities, mismanaged or simply stolen. It is estimated that security votes add up to over N241.2 billion every year.

          "text": "Liverpool won the League Cup final in dramatic fashion as Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga missed the decisive penalty to give the Reds an 11-10 shoot-out victory after a pulsating 0-0 draw at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s side clinched their first domestic knockout prize since the 2012 League Cup when Kepa blazed his spot-kick high over the bar.\n\nIt was the only miss in the nerve-jangling shoot-out, which saw Liverpool keeper Caoimhin Kelleher score his penalty just before Kepa failed.\n\nIronically, Kepa was sent on at the end of extra-time to replace Edouard Mendy given his reputation as a penalty saving specialist, but the Spaniard was unable to repel any of Liverpool\u2019s kicks.\n\nKepa had already endured penalty misery in the 2019 League Cup final when he petulantly refused to be substituted before a shoot-out defeat against Manchester City.\n\nLiverpool saw Joel Matip\u2019s second-half goal controversially disallowed for a marginal offside against Virgil van Dijk, while Chelsea had three goals ruled out for offside later in the match.\n\nThe Reds have lifted the League Cup a record nine times, while Klopp is the first German manager to win the tournament after finally tasting Wembley success following two previous defeats as a boss there.\n\n\u201cThere should be space for some sentiment. Caoimhin Kelleher is a young boy, plays in all the competition. I cannot tell him he can\u2019t play the final,\u201d Klopp said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a manager and a human being and the human being won. He deserves it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the people in dark times to celebrate something like this. Chelsea are incredibly strong, we matched each other. We needed to have luck.\u201d\n\nLiverpool remain in contention for an unprecedented quadruple after closing the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester City to six points with a game in hand.\n\nThey are on course for the Champions League quarter-finals after a last 16 first-leg win at Inter Milan and host Norwich in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the match was memorable, there was a sombre beginning as both teams united in a show of support for war-torn Ukraine before kick-off.\n\nAmid the Russian invasion of its neighbour, Chelsea skipper Cesar Azpilicueta and Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson carried flowers in the country\u2019s yellow and blue colours onto the pitch.\n\nFor Chelsea, this was a painful end to a difficult week, which saw Chelsea\u2019s Russian owner Roman Abramovich on Saturday announce that he is \u201cgiving trustees of Chelsea\u2019s charitable foundation the stewardship and care\u201d of the club.\n\nAbramovich, who will remain the club\u2019s owner, made the move after calls in the UK Parliament for Russian oligarchs to be stripped of their assets.\n\nRelentless Reds\n\nChelsea paid for a series of missed chances, with Christian Pulisic wastefully guiding his close-range effort straight at Kelleher in the opening minutes.\n\nMendy sprawled to his right to repel Naby Keita\u2019s 20-yard drive, then scrambled across to push Sadio Mane\u2019s close-range follow-up over the bar with one hand when it seemed certain he would score.\n\nChelsea should have been ahead before the interval when Pulisic found Havertz and he clipped a cross towards Mason Mount, who somehow volleyed wide from eight yards with the goal at his mercy.\n\nIncredibly, Mount managed an even worse miss early in the second half, scuffing his shot against the post after Pulisic\u2019s deft chip left his teammate completely unmarked inside the area.\n\nChelsea escaped in the 67th minute when Matip nodded Mane\u2019s header into the roof of the net from close range before Van Dijk was adjudged offside.\n\nThe intensity was unrelenting from both teams and Havertz saw his header disallowed for a much clearer offside than the one that denied Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nRomelu Lukaku, introduced after being left on the bench for a second successive game, thought he had put Chelsea ahead in extra-time, but a debatable offside decision disallowed his clinical finish.\n\nHavertz was also denied a goal by another offside flag, setting the stage for Liverpool to win it in the shoot-out.",

          "text": "The EU on Sunday announced swingeing new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, closing its airspace to Russian aircraft and banning Russian state media outlets broadcasting in the bloc.\n\nEU chief Ursula von der Leyen, announcing the measures, also said the European Union was taking the unprecedented step of financing arms to Ukraine, and was hitting Russian ally Belarus with sanctions for facilitating the invasion.\n\nThe measures come on top of sanctions von der Leyen announced a day earlier that are about to be implemented: cutting some Russian banks from the SWIFT interbank messaging network, banning all transactions with Russia\u2019s central bank, and added restrictions on Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe EU has also sanctioned Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nTogether, the steps added up to the toughest stance the European Union has taken against a country, reflecting the bloc\u2019s horror and anger at Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine, launched on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs the war in Ukraine rages on, and Ukrainians fight bravely for their country, the European Union steps up once more its support for Ukraine and the sanctions against the aggressor \u2014 Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d von der Leyen said in a broadcast address.\n\nShe said the airspace ban would prohibit flights into or over the EU by \u201cevery Russian plane \u2014 and that includes the private jets of oligarchs\u201d.\n\nThe measure consolidated what was already de facto largely in place, with many of the EU\u2019s 27 nations individually announcing airspace closures to Russian flights.\n\n\u2013 Stopping Russian \u2018lies\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe move against Russian state media targeted its outlets Russia Today \u2014 known as RT \u2014 and Sputnik, and their subsidiaries.\n\nVon der Leyen said they \u201cwill no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin\u2019s war and to sow division in our Union\u201d.\n\nThe EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, at her side, said the measure involved \u201cbanning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union\u201d.\n\nSputnik responded with a sardonic statement saying: \u201cWe suggest the European Commission not stop halfway and ban the internet altogether.\u201d\n\nRT\u2019s French subsidiary tweeted that the ban \u201cgoes against the very principles of freedom of expression\u201d and said it was a victim of \u201ccensorship\u201d.\n\nVon der Leyen said the sanctions against Belarus were aimed at \u201cthe other aggressor in this war\u201d, naming the regime of strongman Alexander Lukashenko.\n\n\u201cWe will hit Lukashenko\u2019s regime with a new package of sanctions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe will introduce restrictive measures against their most important sectors. This will stop their exports of products from mineral fuels to tobacco, wood and timber, cement, iron and steel.\n\n\u201cWe will also extend to Belarus the export restrictions we introduced on dual-use goods for Russia.\u201d\n\nBelarusians helping Russia\u2019s military operation would also be sanctioned, she said.\n\nVon der Leyen said the decision to provide funding for the purchase and delivery of arms to Ukraine was \u201ca watershed moment for our Union\u201d.\n\nBorrell said he would \u201cpropose to use the European Peace Facility for emergency assistance measures to finance the supply of lethal material to the Ukrainian army, as well as badly needed fuel, protective equipment and medical supplies\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cwe are doing this because this war requires our engagement in order to support the Ukrainian army \u2014 because we live in unprecedented times\u201d.\n\nBorrell was to chair a virtual meeting of the EU\u2019s foreign ministers just after the declarations.\n\nAFP",
