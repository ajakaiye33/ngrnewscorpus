It is either he is not seeing clearly, or he is suffering from amnesia for him not to have noticed all the infrastructural developments in the state, including those in Delta Central such as the Effurun Otor Owor Bridge, Ughelli, new Sapele Road, and the Agbarho Orherhe road, among many others.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Omo-Agege\u2019s criticism of \u2018successive administrations\u2019 of the PDP in Delta State suggests the latter to be the case.\n\n\u201cApparently, he has forgotten that he served in various capacities under the James Ibori administration as Special Assistant, Executive Assistant, Commissioner and Secretary to the State Government.\n\n\u201cOmo-Agege is best advised to concentrate on his doomed governorship ambition instead of trying to throw stones at Governor Okowa whose enviable place in history is already guaranteed.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government has unveiled plans to increase the production of cocoa from the present 340,000 tons to 500,000 tons by 2024.\n\nThe Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar, stated this in Abuja during a visit led by the Executive Director, International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) Mr. Arrion Michel.\n\nWhile explaining that Nigeria was ranked number four among cocoa producing countries in the world, Abubakar assured that the country can achieve an increase in cocoa production based on the present drive of the Federal Government and relevant stakeholders towards utilisation of improved varieties.\n\nHe noted that of utmost importance is traceability and transparency in the cocoa sector, national cocoa farm irrigation, improvement of the cocoa sector through research, input delivery, production, value addition, processing and export.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has made a remarkable move to join the Living Income Differential (LID) initiatives which was established by Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana in 2019 which aims at guaranteeing the livelihood of small holder farmers through LID of $400/ton of cocoa beans sold,\u2019\u2019 adding that the two countries are benefiting while Nigerian cocoa farmers are at disadvantage of this benefit due to unregulated and liberalised cocoa industry in the country.\n\nThe Minister said the interactive meeting between the Nigerian delegation and Ghana cocoa board has yielded a positive result with the recent approval by the ministry to establish the National Cocoa Management Committee (NCMC).\n\nHe added that the committee would consist of stakeholders in the cocoa industry, develop a framework for the regulation and monitoring of activities in the sector to achieve transparency, traceability and sustainability.\n\nThe Minister further stated that the NCMC would be powered by legislation through the National Assembly to give the process a legal backing.\n\nHe pledged that the ministry would implement the LID system in Nigeria as it strives to take cocoa production to a new height.\n\nEarlier, the Executive Director, ICCO, Mr. Arrion Michel informed that Africa produces about 80 per cent of cocoa but the price is determined in Europe and noted there is need to address the market force.\n\nHe also pointed out that Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana and Ecuador are the major producers of cocoa while Nigeria is the fourth producer of the product, noting that the product is a key to smallholders farmers in many countries.",

          "text": "Despite the steady rise in crude oil price, the country\u2019s earnings from the commodity dropped for the fourth month. This was contained in a Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN\u2019s) latest monthly economic report for January 2022.\n\nAccording to the CBN data, the country earned N945 billion in January- representing 7.8 per cent less than the N1.024 trillion budgeted for the period.\n\nA breakdown of the components of oil revenue showed that no revenue accrued from crude oil and gas exports in January, the second straight month the government has earned nothing from such a major income source. This is because the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) is yet to remit funds to the joint pool of the federation account in recent months, due to rising petrol subsidy claims.\n\nAccording to the data, revenue from petroleum profit tax and royalties, which forms the bulk of oil revenue, declined by 31 per cent to N247 billion compared to N360 billion the previous month and was also below the monthly target of N277 billion.\n\nHowever, stakeholders are worried that even as the country\u2019s oil blend- Bonny Light, selling as the most expensive Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) blend, Nigeria has not benefitted much in terms of revenue. On Monday, Bonny Light sold at $124.18.\n\nAccording to the National Operations Controller, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mike Osatuyi, the dip in oil revenue does not come to him as a surprise. He explained that any country paying so much for subsidy should not expect to take full advantage of the galloping price of crude in the international market.\n\nHe warned that by year end, the country may have incurred over N5 trillion in subsidy payment if the naira continues to depreciate against the dollar. \u201cIncurring such cost is not in the best interest of the country. The best solution to curbing this revenue dip in oil is to remove subsidy, but subsidy cannot be removed now when the country is hot. There is inflation, life is difficult for the citizens, so it is very much impossible to remove subsidy.\n\nWho, in Nigeria of today can afford to buy petrol for about N600/litre if subsidy is removed,\u201d Osatuyi argued, adding that removing subsidy means setting the country on fire.",

I worked so hard with sleepless nights to bring our President.\n\n\u201cAll those who have come here to speak should have told Nigerians what they have done in their states. Judge me by my work. When I became the Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the railway was moribund. Today, there are railways across the country.\n\n\u201cPlease delegates, assess us by our contributions.

But here again, you see how it has come. We will continue to hope that one day God will touch the heart of our brothers and sisters to do that which belongs to us.\u201d\n\nUzodimma said the presidential hopefuls from the south-east who withdrew from the race to support northern candidates did so because they hoped to produce the next president when power returns to the south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is what has to be discussed at the party level because it is a serious matter. Because we are dealing with human beings here. You cannot just wake up and take any decision, there are consequences to every action. Those are the things that will be discussed and something must be done,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost of our people (presidential hopefuls) here who came from the south-east, when they saw that it will be difficult clinching to the ticket they opted for a northern candidate.\n\n\u201cThe reason is very simple because when a northern candidate stays for eight years and then the power will come back to the south; this time around maybe we (south-east) will have the opportunity.\u201d",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "On Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the company\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where over the span of 2 hours other executives revealed exciting new software updates and product launches across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch.\n\nHere are a few major announcements:\n\niOS 16\n\nSource: Apple\n\nEight months after Apple released iOS 15, the company unveiled iOS 16, which delivers big updates to the Lock Screen, as well as new sharing, communication, and intelligence features.\n\nWith iOS 16, Apple is ending software support for the devices released before the iPhone 8 (2017), which includes the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone SE 2016, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus.\n\niOS 16 allows for more Lockscreen customization such as color and font changes, as well as support for widgets. Notifications will now \u201croll in\u201d from the bottom of the screen, while a \u201cLive Activities\u201d API will let developers update notifications in real time.\n\niMessage users can now edit or recall recently sent messages for up to 15 minutes after sending it, recover recently deleted messages for up to 30 days after deletion, and mark conversations as unread so they can come back to them later.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nSimilar to how users can set up shared photo libraries in Google Photos, they can now do the same with iCloud Shared Photo Library. This new feature enables you to add up to 5 other people to a library, and everyone in the library can add and edit group photos. Users can choose which photos to share based on a certain start date, or via share photos face detection. It\u2019s also possible to automatically send captured photos to the shared library.\n\nApple Pay Later\n\nSource: Apple\n\nBuy now, pay later services have been on the rise and Apple has decided it wants a part of the $22.86 billion market.\n\nThe company announced Apple Pay Later, a new feature for Apple Pay to let users pay for purchases in 4 installments over time without interest or any fees. Customers will be able to pay for installments over 6 weeks; after paying the first payment at the initial point of sale, they will be expected to make the following 3 payments every two weeks.\n\nNew MacBooks\n\nSource: Apple\n\nTwo years after releasing the 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip\u2014Apple\u2019s custom chip\u2014Apple announced a new version of the MacBook Air with its latest M2 Chip. The M2 chip is said to be 18% faster than the M1 CPU and 35% faster than its GPU.\n\nWhat\u2019s inside the MacBook Air?\n\nIt has a 13.6 inch liquid retina display, TouchID built into the Magic keyboard and 2 USB-C Thunderbolt ports for plugging in monitors and peripherals. The new MacBook Air has a 3.5mm combined audio jack, MagSafe support and will fast charging to get the battery to 50% after just 30 minutes.\n\nSince many activities and interactions are now taking place over video calls, the MacBook Air\u2019s built-in camera offers better resolution (at 1080p) and an improved low-light performance.\n\nThough these new Macs have gone live on Apple product listing site, the tech giant said they can\u2019t be purchased yet until next month. The pricing on the new \u200cMacBook Air\u200c starts at $1,199 for an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, with a 10-core GPU option available for $1,499.\n\nApple also announced the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M2 and set the pricing at $1,299. There are no design updates for the 13-inch model, and it continues to be the only Mac notebook with a Touch Bar.\n\nMac OS\n\nSource: Apple\n\nThe new operating system for Apple\u2019s Laptops, macOS Ventura, includes a new Stage Manager tool, updates to Spotlight, Mail, and Safari, and other continuity features that bring the operating system closer to iOS.\n\nStage Manager gives Mac users a new way to stay focused on the task in front of them while seamlessly switching between apps and windows. Continuity Camera allows iPhone owners to use the iPhone as the webcam on Mac, while the new Handoff feature allows users to start a FaceTime call on their iPhone and easily pass it over to their iPad or Mac.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nWith shared Tab Groups, family or friends can share their favorite sites in Safari and see what tabs others are looking at live. Users can also build a list of bookmarks on a shared Start Page, and even start a Messages conversation or FaceTime call right from Safari \u2014 great for planning a trip or researching a project together.\n\n\u200cmacOS Ventura\u200c will be available to all supported Macs later this year, with a developer beta released on Monday and a public beta testers in July.\n\nSource: Apple\n\n\n\nPasskeys\n\nSource: Apple\n\nLast month, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced plans to expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium.\n\nApple has already kicked its plans into motion with the announcement that Safari will be able to use \u201cpasskeys\u201d instead of passwords. Passkeys are a new system that allows users to log in to websites and apps with biometrics (like fingerprint sensors or facial recognition) without any text-based passwords in the mix.\n\nThis feature is a move to strengthen internet security. Password-only authentication is one of the biggest security problems on the web, and managing so many passwords is cumbersome for consumers, which often leads consumers to reuse the same ones across services.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nine African startups representing 8 countries have been selected to participate in the second edition of the Norrsken Impact Accelerator, a prominent early-stage accelerator. The accelerator is one of the programmes of the Norrsken Foundation. The foundation was established in 2016 by Niklas Adalberth, co-founder of Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna, to support entrepreneurs globally in solving some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nNorrsken Foundation has been courting Africa since it announced in 2019 the launch of its entrepreneurship hub, Norrsken House, in Kigali, Rwanda. The first outside its headquarters, Sweden, the hub also features an African-focused seed fund which has allowed it to invest in Rwandan companies, most notably Viebeg Technology and PesaChoice.\n\nLast December, it opened the hub, welcomed 250 entrepreneurs, and hopes to bring in 750 more. In the same year, it selected 11 startups from Africa to join the inaugural edition of the Norrsken Impact Accelerator.\n\nOf the 20 startups around the world that were chosen for the accelerator, the 9 are African companies are Nigerian digital primary health startup, Clafiya and clean tech startup, SunFi; Mozambican mobility platform Appload; Ugandan lending platform Emata; Tanzanian payment solution Umoja Labs; Rwandan artisan recruitment service Fixa; Ghanaian BNPL platform Motito; South African health network HealthDart; Kenyan savings and investment service Power Financial Wellness. All 20 companies address issues in mental health, poverty, sustainable agriculture, financial inclusion, or green energy.\n\nThe budding businesses will undergo an 8-week growth sprint at Norrsken House in Stockholm; receive mentorship from a roster of over 110 entrepreneurs, investors and unicorn founders; and be given $125,000 in upfront pre-seed or seed investment from the Norrsken Foundation.\n\n\u201cOur accelerator brings together over one hundred extraordinary individuals who channel their knowledge, experience and network to pave the way for early-stage, up-and-coming impact tech startups,\u201d said Funda Sezgi, Norrsken Impact Accelerator managing director and co-founder. \u201cWe only want to work with companies that are solving real, urgent and important problems\u2014problems that matter. We believe that all of the companies in our 2022 cohort are doing exactly this, and we\u2019re so excited to be part of their growth journeys from here!\u201d\n\nSince the inception of the accelerator, participating startups have collectively gone on to raise $24 million in pre-seed and seed funds from investors like Brilliant Minds co-founder Ash Pournori, Kry co-founder Fredrik Jung-Abbou, P\u00e4r Norberg of Nordic Capital, Capital T, Globivest, and Norrsken Foundation.\n\nEarlier this year, we wrote about the Norrsken Foundation\u2019s Norrsken22 Africa Tech Growth Fund, a $200 million fund backed and managed by 30 unicorn founders to help African entrepreneurs build the next generation of tech giants.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The figure that we can account for presently is 38.\n\n\u201cBut we know that many people were taken to private hospitals. Even some people came to take the bodies of their loved ones. We are trying to trace those people so that we can have a recount for all.\n\n\u201cBut in the catholic hospital, which is St. Louis Hospital in Owo, and the Federal Medical Centre in Owo, we have 38 bodies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Akeredolu said no fewer than 22 people were killed in the attack.\n\nHe said the attack affected 80 people out of which 22 lost their lives, while 56 survivors are on admission at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, St Louis Hospital, Owo and the Owo General Hospital as well as some other private hospitals.\n\nAkeredolu stated this on Tuesday during a statewide broadcast to the people of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe total number of people involved was 80. As at now, 56 are on admission, two discharged, while the death toll is 22. Efforts have been deepened to prevent further casualties.\n\n\u201cThe site, that is, St. Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa, Owo presents a gory war-like scene. The Federal Medical Centre, Owo, the St. Louis Hospital, Owo, the General Hospital, Owo as well as some private hospitals in Owo were filled with the injured, most of who were in critical conditions.\n\n\u201cThe most unfortunate part is the lives of innocent children cut down in their prime and some severely injured by the mindless attackers. At Owo, the anger was palpable. The tension was at an abrasive level just as the urge for reprisals was high. Without doubt too, the ripple impact of this heinous act as well as the understandably angry reaction across the state could not have been different.\n\n\u201cI urge our people to be calm but remain vigilant. Do not take the law into your own hands. Leave the rest for government to shoulder.\u201d",

          "text": "Stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector would engage in a robust round table discussion on governments\u2019 key policy around inclusive financial system that will cover all strata of the society.\n\nThe experts drawn from key private sector organisations and regulatory agencies would gather at the inaugural conference on \u2018Financial Inclusion\u2019 being hosted by STANMEG Communications, publishers of Oriental News Nigeria, a statement from Yemisi Izuora, the platform\u2019s editor said.\n\nThe Commissioner for Insurance, Sunday Thomas, who had earlier confirmed participation of the National Insurance Commission, NAICOM, also endorsed the theme of the conference, an initiative he said is a major policy drive which NAICOM is passionate about.\n\nGiven this endorsement, NAICOM would be joining other key stakeholders from the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, the National Communications Commission, First Bank Plc, who will be part of discussants at the confab.\n\nAccording to a release issued by the organizers, the conference is being organized given that over the past couple of years, the Federal Government and stakeholders in financial sector have had to deal with expanding financial services to large community of underserved population and dealing with resilience challenges brought about by the confluence of events that have taken place.\n\nThey have had to cope with spiralling financial services prices, restricted coverage and dwindling capacity and limits in key lines such low internet knowledge of certain segments of the society like, market men and women, artisans and some physically challenged persons.\n\nFinancial services now going digital and dearth of knowledge and risen levels of data and associated costs of telecom services brings huge questions about the effectiveness of the initiative and interruption coverage when combined with the supply chain crunch.\n\nMost underserved groups are demanding cost reductions and our challenging environment peculiarity is part of why the conference is holding to allow stakeholders take a collective view on how to create a suitable path To Advance the initiative.\n\nSTANMEG Communications using rigorous research tools observed huge gap in the financial services system with some members of other social strata excluded.\n\nSince 2005, the Nigerian financial services sector has witnessed increasing activities by both the government and the regulatory authorities aimed at deliberately promoting policies that are intended to grow financial inclusion.\n\nThe CBN has been at the vanguard of encouraging and supporting products that are specifically targeted at the low income and financially excluded, while the government have focused more on both interventionist financing arrangements and building institutions and frameworks that promotes financial inclusion.\n\nThis financial exclusion has significant outcomes for the real sector as lack of access to credit can be a disincentive to entrepreneurship, investment, and economic growth.\n\nThe principle of financial inclusion has assumed greater level of importance in recent times due to its perceived importance as a driver of economic growth. Giving access to the hundreds of millions of men and women who are presently excluded from financial services would provide the possibilities for the creation of a large depository of savings, investable funds, investment and therefore global wealth generation.\n\nIn other words, access to financial services, that are well suited for low-income earners promote enormous capital accumulation, credit creation and investment boom.\n\nThe low-income earners constitute the largest proportion of the population and so control enormous chunk of the economy\u2019s idle fund albeit held in small amounts in the hands of each of the several million members of this group. Harnessing and accumulating these resources provides a huge source of cheap long-term investable capital.\n\nOne of our findings is that all efforts are currently challenged on how to ensure that the poor rural dwellers are carried along considering the lack of financial sophistication among this segment of the Nigerian society due to the general low level of financial literacy.\n\nIt is on this that we are organising the conference as advocacy measure by bringing experts, policy makers and other Key agencies of government in the vanguard of closing the seeming gap to proffer solution on challenges mitigating the initiative.\n\nThe conference will help to advance inclusive financial systems for the identified groups which include Community Based People, Artisans, Low Income Groups, Market Men and Women, Special Persons (Disability Group) that undertake various vocations as well as displaced persons.\n\nThe theme of the conference is \u201cEngaging With Critical Grassroots Groups To Develop Effective Financial Inclusion Initiative\u201d with sub theme \u2018Identifying Key Action Areas For Financial Inclusion Strategy\u2019 and is scheduled to hold on June 16, 2022, at the Sheraton Hotels, Ikeja Lagos.\n\nThe conference chairman is Dr. Uju Ogubunka, Chairman, Bank Customers Association of Nigeria (BCAN), while the Guest Speaker is Mallam Garba Kurfi, managing director APT Securities and Funds Limited.",

So that\u2019s exactly what I revolted against and I remain the leading candidates into this general election. I decided to leave the meeting where such concoction was ongoing. So that\u2019s exactly what took place.\u201d\n\nBello, who said he would not mention anybody\u2019s name because of the respect for elders, expressed the confidence that he would win the primaries.\n\nThe governor said he was not consulted by his colleagues before they arrived at the decision to support a southern presidential candidate reinstating his opposition to rotation of the presidency.\n\n\u201cNobody consulted me over the decision that they took and I will rather say that they were railroaded by certain interests who want to be Vice President at all costs. The issue of turn-by-turn presidency, I continue to oppose it because the insecurity that is facing us today does not respect turn-by-turn presidency, every part of this country is faced with insecurity. Every part of this country is wanting prosperity and the seeming or the disunity that we experiencing today in Nigeria, we want unity in this country and that is exactly what I stand for.\u201d\n\nBello said he would only step down if asked to do so by the President warning however that any other attempt to prevent him from participating at the primaries would be an invitation for trouble in the APC.\n\nAsked about the chances of the ruling party retaining power after the 2023 general elections, the Kogi governor said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that APC will return to power, if we play by the rules of the game.\u201d\n\nRequested to clarify on the rules, he said \u201cFollow all the laws, non-exclusion of anybody who wants to participate and carrying everybody along and ensuring that there\u2019s fairness, equity and justice.\u201d",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nNigerian Mining and Geosciences Society, NMGS, has said that its team of professionals have carried out an investigation into the gas emission and flare encountered during the drilling of a water borehole at Caritas University Amorji Nike, Emene Enugu, Enugu State.\n\nThe 31st President of the NMGS, Alabo Charlesye David Charles stated that the team had interacted with the drillers, the members of the community and other stakeholders and also had immediate impression on the geology and geomorphology of the area.\n\nCharles said that the team had submitted its report and the NMGS hereby presents a summary of the findings of which was suspected that the well penetrated a fracture/fault zone which served as a conduit or migration pathway for hydrocarbon (gas) generated in the deeper buried mature shales of the Nkporo/Enugu, Awgu and Eze-Aku geological formations.\n\nHe pointed out that the initial speculation that the flare was methane gas from fracking of the mature and fractured Nkporo/Enugu Formation is discountenanced due to the sustained flare that has maintained its intensity for over 7 days.\n\nHe explained that it was possible that the borehole penetrated the angular unconformity zone separating the Awgu/Agbani Sandstone of the Benue Trough and the Nkporo/Enugu Formation in the Anambra basin since the borehole was sited near the margin of the Anambra Basin.\n\nHe further explained that Stratigraphic traps may have existed in the basal Nkporo/Enugu Formation as interfingering sands or as stratigraphic/structural combination and sub-unconformity traps at this depth.\n\nMaking his recommendations, the NMGS President said that there was an urgent need to extinguish the flare and save the ecosystem and environment from its negative impact disclosing that this could be done by injecting a high-density cement slurry or drilling mud which would be forcefully reinjected into the borehole at high pressure to snuff off oxygen supply and kill the fire.\n\n\u201cDrilling a relief well to kill the pressure and kill the flare may not be feasible because the subsurface geology and structure of the area are not understood.\n\n\u201cRelevant authorities should liaise with experts in the management of blowout and flares in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria on the best method to be deployed in extinguishing the flare.\n\n\u201cFuture deep borehole drilling in areas generally underlain by shales, irrespective of drilling history, should employ rotary drilling method using appropriate drilling mud to limit the effect of blowouts since drilling mud helps maintain pressure balance in wells.\n\n\u201cProfessional bodies like the NMGS with highly experienced and well-trained geoscientists should be involved in efforts by agencies of government and other organizations to find solutions to this hazard and further investigate the gas resources of the area.\n\n\u201cDetailed geological and geophysical studies should be carried out in the area and environs to help unravel the subsurface structure, stratigraphy and hydrocarbon prospects of the area and by extension of the southern Benue Trough and Anambra Basin.\n\n\u201cIf the gas resource in the area is found to be substantial, the federal government and Enugu State Government should develop a framework to harness the gas resources to enhance industrialization and job creation for the benefit of the state and the nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe added that as the foremost professional body in Nigeria with a pool of highly experienced and well-trained professionals, the NMGS has played critical roles in the development of the natural resources of the nation.\n\nNMGS is the umbrella professional and scientific body of all Geoscientists and Mining Engineers in the Solid Minerals, Oil and Gas, Water and Metallurgical sectors with a membership strength of over 10,000 cutting across both the private and public sectors.\n\nThe NMGS has statutory representation in several government agencies and organization including the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, the Nigerian Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, NEITI, the Council of the Nigerian Mining Engineers and Geoscientists, COMEG, the Petroleum Training Institute amongst others.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, NMCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom has said that Nigeria spent $13 million on bitumen importaton in 2020.\n\nNkom made this known at a round table at the just concluded three -day Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria was blessed with 42.74 billion metric tonnes of bitumen reserve yet untapped, located in Ogun, Ondo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa States.\n\nHe said currently the global market for bitumen was $42 billion, but that the market could increase to $66 billion by 2027 due to its high demand.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there will be rise in the value of bitumen market by 2027 which is why Nigeria should look into bitumen exploration that will bring development to the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria can conserve its foreign exchange when it starts exploration on the mineral and this will bring a boost to our economy.\n\nNkom stressed that Nigeria was ranked 6th in global bitumen deposit as demand for the mineral in Nigeria is high due to high road construction.\n\n\u201cNigeria has more than 160, 000 kilometres of roads to be tarred while only 60,000 are already tarred,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Cyril Azobu, the Partner/Mining Leader, PriceWaterhouseCooper said \u201cNigeria is endowed with a good quality of untapped bitumen.\n\n\u201cBitumen is a big demand all over the world, Nigeria can serve as a hub for local supply of bitumen or asphalt for export in sub-Saharan to other countries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, issued a letter of award on November 11, 2021, to PwC to act as its Transaction Advisor and Programme Manager for the concession of the bitumen block to potential investors.\n\n\u201cProgrammes had been lined up for the successful take for bitumen concession to the right investors, noting that hopefully it will be concluded before the end of this year.\u201d\n\nHe added that the ministry in collaboration with PwC will embark on a sensitisation workshop and an investor conference will be held soon to ensure judicious exploitation of the nation\u2019s bitumen deposits.\n\nAfter repeatedly failing in the past to harness its bitumen reserves, the government in April announced it would grant concessions of bitumen blocks to prospective local and international companies in a bid to end the importation of the mineral deposit in the country.\n\nIt consequently appointed PriceWaterhouseCoopers as its transaction advisor in November 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the total value of capital importation into Nigeria in Q1 2022 stood at US$1,573.14 million from US$2,187.63 million in the preceding quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics has said.\n\nIn the its newly released data on Thursday, NBS said the figure shows a decrease of 28.09 per cent compared to last year.\n\nWhen compared to the corresponding quarter of 2021, capital importation decreased by 17.46 per cent from US$1,905.89 million.\n\nThe bureau statistics showed that the largest amount of capital importation by type was received through Portfolio Investment, which accounted for 60.87 per cent ($957.58 million). This was followed by Other Investment with 29.28 per cent (US$460.59 million) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) accounted for 9.85 per cent ($154.97 million) of total capital imported in Q1 2022.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, Dr Abdulrazaq Garba, has said that there has been an influx of investors because of the quality of geoscience data the agency had generated.\n\nGarba made this known yesterday during an interactive session with newsmen in the agency\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe stated that it was only the right type of data that could attract appropriate investors noting that the the agency has improved from generating surface maps.\n\n\u201cBefore what we do is surface maps but we have improved, we also achieved this using the appropriate tools to produce geodata. We have published the first set of data on geochronology recently, which has to do with ages of minerals,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining capacity development of the NGSA, the Director General pointed out that the agency was the bridge between the academia and the industry.\n\nHe also said that sustainability was the key to driving the mining sector into greater heights as he solicited for more funding to ensure continued growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe further stated that the success stories of the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, could be seen in the increased revenue generation of sister agency such as The Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, and Mines Inspectorate.\n\nSpeaking on the NIMEP Project, he said that it was a means to an end adding that there was no end to data generation as Nigeria was still at the upstream where data generation is very important.\n\nHe explained that the project was a success story as it has been able to produce Three Hundred and Thirty Three (333) maps albums presenting the 36 States and resources found in them.\n\n\u201cWhat we had when I came on board was the Interactive maps, currently we have produced Lithostructural maps that has Tetonic information about Nigeria,\u201d he added\n\nHe said Nigeria has high grade hard rock lithium mineral where pockets of occurrences has been discovered stating that its lithium occurrences were of grade and that investors were currently eager to pay large amount for some of the dataset generated\n\nNigerian Pilot reports that lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, batteries that recharge mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cNigeria lithium is hot cake now, the mineral was discovered in several parts of the country in the course of the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project, NIMEP, during exploration and we did investigation and came up with analysis and discovered that Nigeria lithium is of high grade.\n\n\u201cHigh grade in the sense that the standard worldwide for even exploration and mining starts from 0.4 per cent lithium oxide but when we started exploration and mining, we saw one per cent up to 13 per cent lithium oxide content.\n\n\u201cAnother advantage of Nigeria lithium is hard rock lithium found and that is what investors are looking out for worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe even heard discussion with some private companies with mining licences in Nigeria and they conducted test on the lithium and we also collaborated with Canada on that too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that all data received from NIMEP were quite exciting and would boost the economy.\n\nNIMEP is a hallmark project that provides reliable geo-sciences information needed by investors to make the right mining investment decisions in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that a track of mineralisation almost two to 10 km was discovered close to Abuja, adding that resource evaluation was conducted on the area and anomolous gold, lead and silver were discovered with Tungsten.\n\n\u201cGold mineralisation found there has high content of tungsten which is used as an additive in the production of steel, therefore, any company mining there will be mining gold associated with lead, silver and tungsten.\n\nGarba said that many companies both local and international investors are interested in the data set generated.\n\nHe said that pronouncement would be made soon on companies that had shown interest on those data saying that \u201cwhat we want to do is we are projecting to we concession the areas that are free through the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office, NMCO, so interested investors can get licence and data and take it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThese are the things we are looking at and working on to ensure that the data we generate are useful to investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in his presentation at the just concluded Nigeria- Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, the NGSA boss disclosed that government had identified seven strategic minerals based on the information available on them.\n\n\u201cThe seven minerals are Coal, Iron Ore, Bitumen, Gold, Limestone, Lead/Zinc and Barite,\u201d he listed.\n\nGarba said that the government had invested funds in generating Geoscience data for those minerals to enable investors have adequate knowledge about them.\n\n\u201cBasically, you will agree with me that the business of mining is not meant for government to do investigation on minerals, but in this our particular climate, we need to take this information up to a particular level whereby the minerals will be attractive to investors.\n\nThe NGSA has over a hundred years been the sole generator and validator of geo data and geological information.",

Besides, our company also focuses on hybrid rice research.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the event was to draw the attention of government and farmers to the successes the company has recorded in its Rice research with GAWAL R1 exchange ideas and take the opportunity to boost food security in Nigeria.\n\nOn its research activities he noted that the company is expanding.\n\n\u201cThis year our company established four trial locations across Nigeria for the experiment and comparison of three elite rice varieties, which are Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1(hybrid rice variety), with one location in Abuja. Based on our yield measurement of 66 m2 for each variety in Abuja, the calculated yields per hectare of Faro 44, GAWAL R1 and Mayun 1 are 5.6 mt, 7.0 mt and 8.7 mt respectively with the transplanting method. GAWAL R1\u2019s yield is 25% higher than that of Faro 44 and Mayun 1 is 55% higher than Faro 44\u201d.\n\nHe said the company was also looking at the establishment of rice extension system and improvement of rice research system in collaboration with the agriculture research institutes such as National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), IITA, Bwari Area Council and agricultural research and extension services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aiming to introduce and register many more good quality and high-yield new rice varieties to Nigerian rice farmers\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said that apart from the traditional rice transplanting technique, the company has also been promoting the new technique of broadcasting rice production for large and small-scale farming and the result shows that the rice yield is relatively high as well.\n\nHe said the company was a professional seed company that not only sold seed but taught farmers advanced planting techniques for optimum yield.",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has disclosed that 80 persons were involved in last Sunday\u2019s terror attack at St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa street, Owo.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu said 22 people lost their lives to the horrific attack while 52 survivors are on admission at the Federal Medical Center, Owo, St Louis Hospital, Owo and the Owo General Hospital as well as some private hospitals.\n\nThe Governor disclosed this on Tuesday during a statewide broadcast to the people of the state in respect of the last Sunday terrorist attack at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa Street, Owo.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pope \u2018Deeply Saddened\u2019 By Owo Terrorist Attack\n\nAkeredolu said the attack was an attempt to test the will of the people of the State and indeed, the Southwest.\n\nHe added that the dastardly act has the brazenly possible consequence of invitation to national anarchy, saying that \u201cYorubaland, and Owo in particular, have never been conquered before; and it will never happen.\u201d\n\nHe promised to commit every available resource to hunt down the assailants and make them pay dearly, stressing that the state will never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in its resolve to stamp out criminals.\n\n\u201cThe site, that is, St. Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa, Owo presents a gory war-like scene. The Federal Medical Centre, Owo, the St. Louis Hospital, Owo, the General Hospital, Owo as well as some private hospitals in Owo were filled with the injured, most of who were in critical conditions.\n\n\u201cThe most unfortunate part is the lives of innocent children cut down in their prime and some severely injured by the mindless attackers.\n\n\u201cAt Owo, the anger was palpable. The tension was at an abrasive level just as the urge for reprisals was high. Without doubt too, the ripple impact of this heinous act as well as the understandably angry reaction across the State could not have been different.\n\n\u201cI urge our people to be calm but remain vigilant. Do not take the law into your own hands. Leave the rest for government to shoulder. I have spoken to the heads of the security agencies. I can assure you that security operatives have been deployed to monitor and restore normalcy to Owo kingdom.\n\n\u201cMay I use this medium to express gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, who aside his demonstrated concern, directed his Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON to visit the scene of this criminal act.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum led by its chairman, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, their Excellencies, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the Honourable Minister of Interior and Engr. Seyi Makinde, the Governor of Oyo State also deserve a special mention for their collective and individual show of love and empathy.\n\n\u201cWe will remain eternally grateful to His Excellency, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his donation of a whopping amount of N50 million to the victims and N25 million to the Catholic Church, Owo. The gesture of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum which donated N50 million to the victims is equally appreciated.\n\n\u201cThe donations are to assuage the effects of the attack. In the meantime, I have directed that an account be opened to receive further donations from well meaning individuals and corporate bodies who may wish to assist the victims of the terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cI am particularly enthralled by the wonderful show of solidarity from my brothers across party divides, especially in the State. It is heartwarming that we all have found a common ground to confront these monsters.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I thank the former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and the entire PDP family. To all others too numerous to mention, your show of love, encouragement and goodwill are not taken for granted. You have displayed compassion and demonstrated an appreciable level of brotherliness.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, I commend the medical teams of the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, the St. Louis Hospital, Owo, the General Hospital, Owo and some private hospitals who showed love and participated in stabilising the victims in the various hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe equally appreciate the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) and BEDC for their assistance. I convey our gratitude to volunteers who assisted in evacuating the victims and the dead to the hospitals and mortuaries respectively.\n\n\u201cI also thank our people who had deemed it fit to voluntarily donate blood towards the treatment of the victims. They have lived up to expectation within the precinct of the available space and time.\u201d",

          "title": "APC Special Convention is Nigeria's encounter with Destiny",
          "text": "Here comes a time in a nation when the hopes of the moment. Let not the destiny of this land be stolen because we did not do what was meant for us to do at this critical moment. Remember, we formed this party, APC, not simply to wrest power from a wrong and failing PDP.\n\nWe formed this party to give the people of this land the progressive good governance they deserve so that they may live as well and as peacefully as any people on the face of this earth. This corrective journey began with the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. At this convention, we must take the next step toward the proper and necessary direction.\n\nIn 2015, the All Progressives Congress won the election to halt the drift in our nation\u2019s governance, redirect our path, and make clear our national priorities We dedicated this party to the guiding principle that government must be for the benefit or each and every Nigerian before it is for the benefit of any single one of ns, No one is above legal rule or regulation. Likewise one is too low for justice and compassionate governance cover or protect him.\n\nWithin this context, the APC under President Muhammadu Buhari has governed with patriotic and disciplined commitment this past seven years. The Buhari government has championed needed reforms, ranging from an innovative petroleum industry law to measures that are aimed at improving power and electricity generation for all Nigerians. Government has invested heavily in building modern airports and railway network and roads. Every Naira is better managed than in prior administrations.\n\nThis greater fiscal probity was achieved despite the vast reduction in national revenue caused by the COVID and recurrent global economic downturns. The Buhari government has done more with much less than its PDP predecessors did. The successive PDP administrations did next to nothing with the plenty they had. What they did with our nation\u2019s abundance is no secret. But what they did not do was even a greater embarrassment.\n\nThey left abandoned infrastructure projects all across the nation. The APC completed them. They allowed ISWAP/ Boko Haram to erect strongholds. The Buhari government has been compelled to wage great war against these threats because of the decade of neglect by the PDP.\n\nThe PDP should have uprooted this evil when it was but a seed. The APC-led government is now left to contend with the dangerous tree it has become. Yet, as surely as I can state my name, the next APC government shall uproot this evil such that, never again, shall it try to take hold in this land.\n\nWhile fighting this evil with a purposeful hand, we remain mindful of the socio-economic and political inequalities that often spawn unrest and social instability. Despite economic difficulties wrought by protracted global recession, the APC-led government has progressed in diversifying the economy, improving food security through intense investment in the agricultural sector.\n\nBut the long day for national rebuilding is not over. Even greater, bolder work is needed to beat back the hard challenge swe face. Yet, my hope is high and that is hope not for myself but for you and this nation, My greatest trust and comfort reside in the innate goodness of the people of our beloved nation, Joiner in common purpose, with leadership informed by wise and correct policies, the things that we can accomplish are nothing less than historic.\n\nWe can change the very face of the nation Though this season of primaries has been abbreviated, I have talked to thousands of people across this land. Yes, there were crowds and jubilant receptions offered me. These were nice things, but they are not the most important factors to the task at hand. People approached me wanting to know if I had a plan to continue the fight against terror and violence.\n\nThey wanted to know if I cared about agriculture and the plight of the ordinary farmer. Youths asked me about jobs and their future in this world. The poor asked how and when they will be assured that they can daily place food on the table for their innocent children.\n\nThey did not ask for mage or for me to give them charming yet empty responses. Our people asked honest, serious questions and I gave then honest and serious answers I told them what we can achieve through hard work and dedication to a higher national purpose\n\nI told them we must work harder than ever; but I also assured them that the average person shall not feel left behind, Building on the reforms of the past seven years and on the progressive ideals of our party, the coming APC-led government, under my watch, shall place the welfare of the average Nigerian above that of any elite or special interest. Our progressive government must be for the people and never for the powerful.\n\nThe powerful already have. Let us give succour and an open door to the less privileged. Let us bring forth a society built on shared prosperity, belief in justice, compassion for others and an unshakable commitment to a form of governance that treats all citizens with equal respect and due regard. Let us not just open the door to the promise of a better society. Let us brick by brick and stone by stone build a new society that begets a greater nation.\n\nWeighty matters now rest in the balance. A fateful decision awaits you the delegates to this convention. Choose that which most wholly benefits the nation. Think big at this moment that we may accomplish great things in the next APC administration that will come on 29 May 2023.\n\nMy experience in office and the knowledge gained through hard work, tough trials and patient undertaking have prepared men for this hour. I am a man of purpose with a serious mission. My vow is to use all that I know and all of my abilities to the benefit of the nation and its people. I do not step forward because I think this nomination is my due. I step forward because I can help lead our nation to become what it ought to be.\n\nI do not say this as a boast. Hear me out. I claim not to be special nor great. My training, experiences, acquired knowledge are what is special and uniquely suited for this moment. I am merely a conduit, a servant of a cause much larger than myself.\n\nNow is a time for progressive vision and singular purpose. There is a general agreement that 2023 will be an encounter with destiny, when our nation shall need a certain type of leader to realise a better Nigeria.\n\nWe need to build a Nigeria where sufficient jobs for the urban population are available and lead to a good life most wholly benefits the nation.

Additionally, we must continue to empower the states so that grassroots economic and political development is maximised.\n\nThough our tribe and tongue may differ, we must build a united country , premised on equity, fairness and justice. True reform and progress lie not in copying others but in identifying our own opportunities. I have done this in Lagos. I humbly ask you to allow me to use these skills and experiences to advance the nation.\n\nI come to you with a coherent vision on how to improve our nation such that our schools, industry, agriculture and infrastructure will become the pride of all. Ours shall be a land where all Nigerians will have an equal chance and no one is excluded because of his ethnic background, religious creed, place of origin or social station. We are all Nigerians.\n\nBy this statement, Iseek your help and support to become our party\u2019s nominee and standard bearer in the coming February 2023 elections. To lead Nigerians is a sacred trust, which I do not take lightly or seek selfishly. By giving me the party\u2019s mandate, I hereby makey solemn vow to make Nigeria the best home for its citizens.\n\nAs an indivisible, united country, we shall overcome the destructive forces attempting to steal our destiny. May the triumph of our democratic journey be complete and serve as an exemplar to Africa, our race, and the rest of mankind. We were born for this moment. Let us now make the most of it and fulfil our destiny.\n\nI thank you all for listening.\n\nMay God bless you all.\n\nMay God Bless our party, the APC.\n\nMay God bless our beloved nation, the Federal Republic of\n\nNigeria.\n\n*Asiwaju Bola Ahmed TINUBU",

          "text": "With some last minute intrigues and horse-trading, a former governor of Lagos State, often addressed as National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is projected to emerge the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\nAccording to exit polls, Tinubu is likely to win most votes in the North-west, South-west, some North-central and doing well in other places.\n\nIndications that the odds might favour Tinubu began to manifest after some of the aspirants started to stand down their aspiration and declare support for him and urged their delegates to vote for him at the convention.\n\nVoting had to be halted due to fears over security concerns thus pushing the process till Wednesday morning. There were issues of accreditation and crowd loitering too close to the designated point of voting. Hawkers of soft drinks, water and other essentials practically took over the arena. It took the election and planning committee and security personnel some time to restore order before voting resumed.\n\nThose, who stepped down for Tinubu were former Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru; former Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole; Senator Ajayi Boroffice and the only female aspirant, Uju Ohanenye.\n\nTinubu, who was the first to address the special convention, held at the Eagle Square, Abuja, however, boasted he had the capacity to articulate a vision of progress for the country if elected candidate of the party and ultimately, president of the country.\n\nBut President Muhammadu Buhari, who spoke before voting commenced, enjoined the delegates to vote the candidate with the best chance of emerging victorious at the general election.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who also took his turn to address the convention after all other aspirants had taken their turns, spoke to the heart of the delegates, when he said there was no one they would wish the nation well and still vote someone they did not believe in.\n\nAt the same time, the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, yesterday, told members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party that washing their dirty linen in public was not a mark of courage but a mark of irresponsibility and indiscipline.\n\nBuhari, while addressing the delegates, noted that the critical task ahead of the Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) was to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of the party.\n\nThe president said the candidate of the party must be knowledgeable, fair-minded nationalist with a very strong belief in the unity of the country and strength of character and purpose to steer the country forward.\n\nBuhari also urged party officials and delegates to follow due process and abide by all extant laws and regulations pertaining to election of the party flag bearer.\n\nHis words: \u201dAs we go into the presidential primary, I urge all to keep to the same spirit. We must avoid acrimony and maintain the spirit of sportsmanship. The critical task ahead of the Abdullahi Adamu-led NWC remains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of our great party.\n\n\u201dI enjoin you all to be fair to all and to create a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants in the coming crucial party exercise.\n\n\u201dPlease, follow due process in all the party decisions and I call on all party members, particularly, the party officials and delegates to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to consider voting for the presidential candidate with the best chances of securing victory for our great party in the coming general election,.\u2019\n\nWhile noting that the principal challenge before the party was the need to keep a united front, Buhari affirmed that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the party constitution, to ensure smooth party administration and operations in these critical times in the overall interest of the party.\n\n\u201dPlease do not hesitate to call on me and all other appropriate quarters for the help that will propel our great party to the victory that we all seek. To ensure a hitch-free presidential primary, please, let us work collectively in the interest of our great party and our great country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President, therefore, congratulated all the winners, and the newly emerged party standard bearers for the 2023 general election and urged the winner to be magnanimous in victory, particularly, towards fellow aspirants, who conceded to him.\n\nOn his part, Adamu, who came down on the NWC members, frowned at their approach in dealing with issues.\n\nMembers of the NWC, had addressed the press to deflate Adamu\u2019s plan to impose the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nIn his response, he said, \u201cOn the 20th of April this year, I drew the attention to the need for our party to be disciplined; that a political party such as APC, the ruling party, at the heart of our national development, must be exemplary and discipline and fidelity in its core values.\n\n\u201cWashing our dirty linen in the public is not a mark of courage, it is a mark of irresponsibility, indiscipline and indiscriminate to obey extant rules and regulations and play by them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman was of the opinion that unity was the only glue that could hold the party together, saying the ruling party could not go into the general election next year without putting its house in order.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take rocket science to unite a party; it takes sincerity of purpose, commitment and determination to sacrifice our individual interest and ambitions for the larger interest of the party.\u201d\n\nAdamu, however, noted that the healing process in the ruling party had commenced, addingthat, \u201cthings are not falling apart; things are holding up and I am grateful to you all for standing by me and members of the National Working Committee in seeing that we carry out the first order of business in our party and that is the total reconciliation of all the state branches of the APC that were held hostage by avoidable grievances.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to gain in portraying our party in a bad light. We have everything to lose in undermining the integrity of our great party. I found it necessary to make this observations.\u201d\n\nAdamu said it was a clear indication that the ruling party had emerged stronger from the grievances, noting that the party was united and speaking with one voice once.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt the end of the current exercise, we shall begin a steady march towards the 2023 elections, going by our resolute, commitment to win and win big in all levels of elective offices up for contest.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Tinubu said the candidate of the party must be able to unite Nigerians from all parts of the country and must have the experience, leadership, knowledge, and extensive personal contacts to steer a diverse, complicated Nigeria through this challenging period in a dynamic world.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates are all good men. But I sincerely believe I am the person this moment calls for.\n\n\u201cI cannot, on this day, talk of a bright and prosperous future without also declaring my determination to fight terrorism and insecurity to the very end. I mourn the lives already lost and vow to do everything possible to ensure justice and forever erase terror from our land.\n\n\u201cToday, you decide our presidential nominee. Let it be the man, who can best articulate a vision of progress and development then implement it. Let us always honour the promise the APC made to Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo, in his speech, said the future of the country and the children should compel the delegates to vote right, adding that they could not wish the country well and vote for someone they do not believe in.\n\nHe said, \u201c2322 delegates will decide the future of our children and their own children. The future of our children compels all our distinguished delegates to vote right tonight.\n\n\u201cYou cannot wish this country well and vote for someone you do not believe in. To our dear delegates, when you vote tonight, know that your votes tonight carry the answer for the future of our children and for our country.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said the present situation in the country did not need a leader that would learn on the job, adding that it was the main reason he was the best man to take over from the president in 2023.\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain, the circumstances of the country will not allow the next leader to learn on the job. For the past seven years, I have learnt on the job. I will be prepared from day one,\u201d he added.\n\nImmediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, also called on the delegates to ask all the presidential aspirants the sources of their money, adding that, if elected, he would develop the country\u2019s economy.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cDear delegates, assess us by our contributions. Do not assess us by how much we bring here, because if you assess us by how much we bring here, ask all of us what is our source of revenue? How did we get all these funds?\n\n\u201cThe problem of the Nigerian state is all of us. Nigerian politicians will come and talk to you, bring out money and we accept them. Four years after, they will come back and still make the same promises. Do not vote for me if I lie to you. Do not vote for me if I have not performed but I have performed.\n\n\u201cThere is need to move forward, to ask Nigerians to hire me and fire me if I fail. If you vote for me, the first thing is that we must develop our economy, bringing it back to industrialisation and production. We will rebuild our universities to be places of learning. There will be rule of law. People will be punished for their crimes.\u201d\n\nGovernor of Kogi state, Yahaya Bello, said he was in the race to win, adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t come this far to chicken out,\u201d boasting that at the end of the contest, he would emerge victorious.\n\nPastor Tunde Bakare said his aspiration to be the president of Nigeria wasn\u2019t about him, but about the people of Nigeria.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is about your people, it is about my people, the Nigerian people, who will once again have a reason to believe that they have a stake in their nation when our presidential commission for National Reconciliation, Reintegration and Rebirth restores lasting peace to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe time is now and the hour has come. Tonight, I am not here to step down. By the grace of God, I am here to step up with the support of the delegates as the 16th president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Dear delegates, as we converge in our nation\u2019s capital to collectively take a historic step towards the realisation of a nation that works.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the youngest presidential aspirant, Nicolas Felix, also a pastor, stepped down for Osinbajo.\n\nBut voting was still ongoing at the time of going to press, while only three states had voted, before the planning committee halted the process on account of some challenges.\n\nEFCC: Why We Stormed APC Convention\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), yesterday, explained why operatives of the commission stormed Eagle Square, venue of the presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAllegations of financial inducement of delegates made the rounds at the primaries.\n\nSome sources claimed that there was inducement of delegates to the tune of $25,000,$30,000 and $40,000 in some cases, which exchanged hands at the venue of the election.\n\nSpokesman of the EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, in a chat with THISDAY, said the operatives of the commission were at the Eagle Square to monitor the primaries.\n\n\u201cIs it not obvious? It is obvious. We are there to monitor proceedings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe agency had carried out a similar operation during the primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was won by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nBut in spite of the hoopla over financial inducement at the PDP primaries, no arrest was made.\n\nBello: Playing By Rules Only Way to Win Presidency\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, has declared that the only way the ruling APC could win the presidency again in 2023 was if it played by the rules of the game.\n\nHe said any attempt to exclude some aspirants from participating in the electoral process or skew the process to favour some persons or groups against others would spell doom for the party.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday with newsmen after meeting behind closed-doors with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja, Bello, a presidential aspirant of the APC, alleged that governors of the party from the North and some elite conspired against him to muscle him out of the contest.\n\nAsked if he was sure that the ruling party would win the presidency in 2023, the governor said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that APC will return to power, if we play by the rules of the game.\u201d\n\nOn what he meant by playing by the rules of the game, he said, \u201cFollow all the laws, non-exclusion of anybody, who wants to participate and carrying everybody along and ensuring that there\u2019s fairness, equity and justice.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated his opposition to the rotational presidency, saying it doesn\u2019t give room for the emergence of a competent person to pilot the affairs of the country.\n\nOn what was the agenda of his meeting with the President, the governor said, \u201cOf course, you know that today (yesterday) is the special national convention of our party, where a presidential candidate from the All Progressives Congress will emerge. Leading up to today, there have been various controversies and issues before today.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Monday), a certain video went viral, that I got angry and I left a particular meeting and then, of course, this is a period, when a lot of lies, a lot of misconceptions, will fill the air. Then, we have our father, the leader of our party, who should always know the reality or the truth, and then I came to brief him exactly what happened.\n\n\u201cWell, some of my colleagues, led by the self-proclaimed leader of them, ganged up to suppress the voice of the people, the voice of over 26 million Nigerians, the voice of the women, the voice of people living with special needs, the voice of the choice of the party. So, that\u2019s exactly what I revolted against. I decided to leave the meeting where such concoction were ongoing. That\u2019s exactly what took place.\u201d\n\nAsked to mention the name of governor that he was talking about, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mention a name because I am honorable enough. The office I occupy today is an office that should be dignified. Myself, I have respect for leaders, for elders, even if some elders do not respect themselves, I have high respect for those in positions of authority. So, I wouldn\u2019t mention names.\u201d\n\nOn why he was not on the same page with Northern APC governors after several attempts made by the governors as revealed by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, to make him consider his colleagues\u2019 position of conceding the presidency to south, he said he was not consulted by anyone.\n\n\u201cI am a unifier, I have demonstrated that severally in my state. I have demonstrated that severally in the various tasks that were given me by the party. So, nobody consulted me. Nobody consulted me over the decision that they took and I will rather say that they were railroaded by certain interest who want to be VP at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe issue of turn-by-turn presidency, I continue to oppose it because the insecurity that is facing us today does not respect turn-by-turn presidency, every part of this country is faced with insecurity. Every part of this country is wanting prosperity and the seeming or the disunity that we experiencing today in Nigeria, we want unity in this country and that is exactly what I stand for.\u201d\n\nOnly Tinubu Can Defeat Atiku, Says Group\n\nA pro-Bola Tinubu group, The Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA), has said the former Lagos State governor, was the only one that could defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe group, in a statement titled: \u201cOur Stand\u201d and signed by Dr. Adelanke Peter, said for Nigeria to consolidate on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, a bold, frank, independent, transparent, intelligent, smart-thinker like Tinubu was needed.\n\nPeter said, \u201cAlthough the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC). We, however, owe it to the party and party members to guide them in terms of direction ahead of the National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA) with its firm foundation within 36 States of the Federation and FCT, emerged as worthy Ambassadors of the APC who recognised and appreciated the progress made by the President Buhari led administration.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the areas of infrastructure, human capital development, agriculture, anti-corruption, digital economic transformation and all inclusive governance. The group said it resolved to identify and unify all political structures and supporters of the aspirants that contested elective posts under the umbrella of the APC.\n\n\u201cParticularly the 23 presidential aspirants by providing the necessary support to the flag bearers after the primaries. \u201cIt is for this reason, after due consultations and considerations, that we suggest that the party should field a candidate that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder, eye-ball-to-eye-ball, kobo-for-kobo, tactics-for-tactics.\u201d\n\nDeath at APC Convention\n\nThe All Progressives Congress delegate from Buji Local Government Area (LGA) of Jigawa State, Alhaji Isa Baba Buji, has died. He was aged 61. The delegate, who was present to participate in his party\u2019s presidential primaries died yesterday afternoon in Abuja. It wasn\u2019t, however, certain what actually killed Buji. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, has expressed sadness over the sudden death of the delegate, describing it as saddening.\n\nOsinbajo, in a statement by his media Aide, Laolu Akande, condoled with the family, associates, government and people of Jigawa State and prayed for the repose of the soul of the delegate.",
          "summary": "According to exit polls, Tinubu is likely to win most votes in the North-west, South-west, some North-central and doing well in other places.\nHis words: \u201dAs we go into the presidential primary, I urge all to keep to the same spirit.\nTo ensure a hitch-free presidential primary, please, let us work collectively in the interest of our great party and our great country,\u201d he said.\nPeter said, \u201cAlthough the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nWe, however, owe it to the party and party members to guide them in terms of direction ahead of the National Convention.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has said consumption of unsafe or contaminated food was causing the country and other low income economies estimated $95 billion in productivity decline.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire who spoke at this year\u2019s World Food Safety Day in Abuja, on Tuesday, said the public health burden due to food borne diseases was comparable to malaria and HIV-AIDS.\n\n\u201cUnsafe food hinders development especially on low and middle Income economies which lose around $95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability and premature death suffered by workers,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the diseases resulting from in-take of contaminated food, Ehanire said over 200 diseases were caused by unsafe food consumption.\n\nAccording to the minister, the magnitude of the public health burden due to food borne diseases was comparable to malaria and HIV-AIDS, adding that under five-year children were higher at risk of malnutrition and mortality due to unsafe food consumption.\n\nHe also said the children share about 40 per cent of the food borne disease burden.\n\n\u201cUnsafe food causes one in every six deaths from diarrhea, a major killer of children of the age group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the World Food Safety Day provided an opportunity to raise awareness about the dangers of unsafe food, government, producers, handlers and consumers having a role to play in making food safe.\n\nOn her part, the Director General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, (NAFDAC), Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, urged Nigerians to always ensure that only safe, and wholesome food were consumed to boost immunity and improve the body\u2019s natural defenses in fighting diseases.\n\nShe said Nigerians do not need medicines if they eat right, stressing that eating right means making healthy food choices from safe, wholesome, and nutritious foods.\n\nAdeyeye said this during NAFDAC\u2019s celebration of the fourth World Food Safety Day 2022 with the theme: \u201cSafer Food, Better Health,\u201d where she opined that where food is unsafe, \u201cour nutritional goals cannot be achieved.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by the Resident Media Consultant to NAFDAC, Sayo Akintola, Adeyeye was quoted as saying that safe food was an essential component of sustainable development and contributes towards improvement of public health, poverty reduction, and increased food security.\n\nShe noted that the theme for this year was very apt, as the world gradually returns to normal with the COVID-19 pandemic having lost its firm grip on the world.\n\n\u201cYou all know my popular saying about not needing medicine if one eats right. Eating right means making healthy food choices from safe, wholesome, and nutritious foods,\u201d she added.\n\nShe stressed that the occasion of World Food Safety Day was an opportunity to create and generate awareness around food safety and situate it as a very significant issue of public health concern, especially in the light of safe, wholesome food being important for boosting immunity and improving the body\u2019s natural defenses in fighting diseases.\n\n\u201cThe theme Safer Food, Better Health is very relevant to us here in Nigeria as a large proportion of the foods we consume are produced by micro- and small-scale producers; these include our smallholder farmers, street food vendors, the traditional, open food markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThe NAFDAC boss however, noted with dismay that their activities were of concern regarding safe food practices or lack of it.\n\nShe added that the foods are frequently exposed to less than hygienic and sanitary conditions, resulting in contamination and leading to incidences and outbreaks of foodborne diseases, situations that are steadily becoming significant food safety concerns.\n\nThe NAFDAC boss disclosed that unsafe foods are the cause of many diseases and contribute to other poor health conditions, such as impaired growth and development.\n\n\u201cWe know that food safety is a shared responsibility, and everyone has a role to play in ensuring we have safer food for better health: from growers to processors, to transporters, sellers, buyers, and those who prepare or serve food.\n\n\u201cPolicy makers, educational institutions and workplaces, as well as consumers are not left out; food safety is the responsibility of all. We must all work together to help achieve safer food for better health,\u201d she added.\n\nShe urged policy makers and food regulators to design all public procurement of food, such as food aid, school feeding and other publicly owned food outlets, so that consumers can access safe and healthy foods.\n\nShe added that they should support policy measures and legal frameworks to strengthen the national food safety system and ensure it complies with food safety standards and regulations.",
