          "title": "Untreated severe allergy could affect quality of life, cause death, paediatrician warns",
          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Consultant Paediatrician at the Department of Paediatric and Child Health, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja,\n\nDr. Olatunde Odusote has urged Nigerians to be mindful of their lifestyle and environment, adding that they should avoid things that could predispose them to the risk of severe allergy.\n\nWhile noting that anybody can have an allergy, Dr. Odusote warned that severe allergy can kill and diminish the quality of life of an individual if left untreated.\n\nDr. Odusote who is also Head, Division of Allergy, Dermatology and Pulmonary Medicine at the teaching hospital, disclosed this during an exclusive interview with PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nHe stated that an unhealthy lifestyle, indiscriminate use of antibiotics, and exposure to chemicals and fumes predispose people to the risk of allergy.\n\nThe paediatrician who is also an allergologist and dermatologist said it\u2019s untrue that allergy is a Whiteman\u2019s disease as viewed by a lot of Nigerians, urging those battling with it to seek help from experts.\n\nAllergy, he said is a composite of diseases and makes the body fight what he described as an unnecessary war.\n\nGiving insight into allergy, its predisposing factors and its impact on the quality of life of individuals affected, the allergologist explained, \u201cAllergy is a spectrum. It is a group of diseases Basically, what allergy means is that your body is fighting an unnecessary battle.\n\n\u201cThere is a part of your immune system that was originally designed to fight parasitic infections like worms and all that.\n\n\u201cBut for some reason, instead of using it to fight that war, it\u2019s fighting an unnecessary war.\n\n\u201cIt is like fighting a thing that is not necessary. So, because of that fight, there are expressions of diseases that come out of them and asthma is one of them.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cThe other one is called hay fever. You can be allergic to food and the common food people are allergic to can start from cow\u2019s milk, egg, peanut, crayfish, and preservatives in food.\n\n\u201cAnother group is drugs. There are some people who if they take certain drugs, can die from taking those drugs. There is also an allergy to the skin.\n\n\u201cThere is a part of your body that is designed to fight parasitic infections but because they are redundant they are now fighting this battle.\n\n\u201cBut the thing is that a lot of Nigerians think that allergy is a Whiteman\u2019s disease. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s there. If people are exposed to the triggers, they will have the disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Odusote noted that allergy was driven by lifestyle and the way people live.\n\n\u201cWestern lifestyle and urbanisation drive these things. Non-noncommunicable diseases like stroke and cancer are common, the same way allergic issues will continue because of our western lifestyle\u201d, he added\n\n\u201cBasically, allergy is going to be an issue with time because you can have that tendency but there must be a trigger from the environment that will make you have an expression of these diseases,\u201d he said.\n\nOn its impact on the lives of those affected, the paediatrician said, \u201cThere are severe forms of allergy that can kill. It is called anaphylaxis. For example, if you are allergic to a drug, if they give you, within five minutes, the person is dead if the right things are done.\n\n\u201cI am sure you have heard of people dying from a peanut allergy and seafood allergy and all that. When they eat the food, within 30 minutes to one hour, they can be dead.\n\n\u201cBut there are other forms of allergy that will not kill you, for example, hay fever. Hay fever will not kill you but will make your life miserable. It\u2019s on record that if you have hay fever, your sleep quality will be poor. You get to school you will be sleeping.\n\nAccording to the allergologist, a child that is doing very well before will start failing.\n\n\u201cA person that has high performance at work because he doesn\u2019t have a good sleep quality, will not perform well. So that is the two ends of the spectrum.\n\n\u201cHay fever can diminish the quality of life of an individual. Some allergies will not kill you but can make your life miserable.\n\n\u201cYou are sleepy, tired, angry with everyone and not knowing that you have an allergy that has not been taken care of.\n\n\u201cSome allergic reactions can be embarrassing and the quality of life can be affected,\u201d he explained.\n\nCharting the way forward, Dr. Odusote urged Nigerians battling allergies to seek help from experts and eat properly.\n\nHe also stated that industrial waste and fumes should be minimised, adding that Nigerians should avoid smoking and junk foods.\n\nIn a 2022 study published by ScienceDaily, researchers said approximately one-third of the world\u2019s population suffers from one or more allergies, with the trend increasing every year.\n\n\u201cBy far the most widespread form of allergy is the so-called type I allergy, also known as immediate-type allergy. This includes, for example, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), allergic asthma, food allergies, or allergies against insect venoms, pollen, grasses, or house dust mites\u201d, the researchers said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Relationship expert, Blessing Okoro popularly known as Blessing CEO has reacted to the shocking crash of Funke Akindele and JJC Skillz\u2019s marriage, stating that it\u2019s always the successful women who take the blame in Africa when marriages go down.\n\nBlessing in a post on her Instagram page also reiterated that almost all the beautiful unions are going down and it is so heart breaking but that does not stop marriage from being the most beautiful thing God gave to mankind.\n\nShe wrote, \u201cAlmost all the beautiful unions that we all use to hold on too are going down \ud83d\ude29. It is so heart breaking but that does not stop marriage from being the most beautiful thing God gave to mankind but na mankind dey spoil am .\n\n\n\n\u201cTherapy is underrated in this part of the world so we better embrace it to at least get answers to our questions.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wish Funke and her family well \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f. All the best to them . Forget noise marriage sweet oooo, with the right person .. NOTHING WILL EVER BEAT COMPANIONSHIP\u2026\u2026\u2026 no matter the noise.\u201d\n\nWhile reacting to a comment made by an award Nollywood Filmmaker and Relationship Adviser, Samuel Jemitalo, who had cautioned men never to marry women who are already successful or the ones who are social media freaks, Blessing berated Africans for always blaming successful women whenever a marriage fails.\n\nSamuel Jemitalo wrote who was reacting to the crash of Funke\u2019s marriage wrote, \u201cMen, never marry a woman that has made it\u2026 she will never respect you \ud83d\udcaf Never marry a woman that is a \u2018Social media Freak\u2019\u2026 they learn things from a lot of women who don\u2019t know the meaning of \u2018Feminism\u2019. Never marry a woman that is full of herself, a woman that makes you feel privileged to marry her. These kind of women are grossly Rude. Marry a humble, Nice & Born Again woman\u201d\n\nBlessing who was not pleased with his comment responded on her page saying, \u201cAs usual they push the blame \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.\n\n\u201cYou say never marry a woman who has made it yet you men say you want independent women .

Boys like to relax and push blames, the only thing that functions is their manhood, they hate responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhile men understand responsibility and carry it on their shoulders. A lot of boys with manhood who can\u2019t handle responsibility yet get intimidated when a woman Carries it.\n\n\u201cMany of u men are not looking for women to marry but looking for door mats in disguise of born again to intimidate. It is always the successful woman who takes the blame in Africa once a marriage goes down .\n\n\u201cNa bad thing to hustle like man ? If we no hustle then still call us gold diggers . Men need to sit up and think, what else can u give a woman apart from money ?? Many men can\u2019t give anything that is why it is difficult for most of them to stay with successful women .

In addition, the group will visit universities and high schools, meet Nigerian students, and explore their historical ties to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe 1972 visit to Nigeria infused African music into the Glee Club\u2019s tradition and American Choral music in general. Fifty years later, choirs across the United States sing in Nigerian languages, highlighting the long-term impact of that exchange. The Morehouse College Glee Club has since learned a variety of songs in Edo, Yor\u00f9b\u00e1, Hausa, and Igbo, including a piece specifically composed for them by Igwe Laz Ekwueme, famed Nollywood actor and University of Lagos professor.\n\n\u201cDuring the visit, the Morehouse College Glee Club will carry out a dynamic exchange of musical knowledge with the broad spectrum of the Nigerian society, singing in Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba languages,\u201d the statement made available to Saturday Vanguard by Ibelli revealed.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard noted that the visit will strengthen the longstanding ties between American and Nigerian institutions of higher learning, and further expand the scope of academic and cultural relations between the United States and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cCultural exchanges such as the visit of the Morehouse College Glee Club will help contribute to strengthening the bonds of friendship and collaboration through music and arts, offering an opportunity for Nigerian students to learn about academic experiences in the United States,\u201d Ambassador Leonard added.\n\nMany of the student members of the Morehouse College Glee Club described their visit as an opportunity to connect with their African roots.\n\n\u201cI love the culture of Nigeria,\u201d 19-year-old Schneider Grandpierre, a junior third-year student studying Music and Computer Science at the Morehouse College said of the trip. \u201cIt is such an enriching and amazing experience to be able to reconnect with our cultural roots and sing Nigerian music in different languages. I look forward to an extended stay here even after this tour.\u201d\n\nExpressing his excitement about the visit, 23-year-old John Batey, a Business Administration major and tenor singer for the choral group said he has been able to trace his roots to Nigeria through a DNA test. \u201cWe will be exploring the Nigerian creative and entertainment industry. I am excited about the tour,\u201d Batey said of the trip.\n\nDirector of the Morehouse College Glee Club, Professor David Morrow, explained that the choral group will perform a repertoire of African and American songs particularly African-American spirituals which have roots in West African music traditions.\n\nProfessor Morrow noted that the Morehouse College Glee Club is rooted in Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr\u2019s legacy. Dr. King who sang in the Morehouse College Glee Club was one of the notable alumni of the Historically Black College in the United States.\n\nSome of the Igbo names given to the Igbo-Americans include: Ezuomike, Ogalanya, Odenigwe, Anyim, Ifeanyi among others.",

We don\u2019t want anybody to smear the name of PYM because we have a reputation to protect.\u201d\n\nSadiq insisted that both Mustapha and his wife are no longer part of the group, and therefore warned the public against dealing with them.\n\nAlso, the South-South leader of PYM, Prince Godswill Edward said the group cannot be fighting and advocating for a new kind of leadership while engaging in gross misconduct.\n\nAccording to him, \u201canybody who portrays the attitude different from what we believe in becomes the enemy of this association. I cannot put my face and die in silence. We have taken a position, we have disbanded them. They were members of our group, but now they stand suspended until further notice.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Southeast leader, Oscar Obi, said the group has disassociated itself from the two members, \u201cwho have shown unscrupulous attitude, they have depicted manners that are contrary to our core objectives.

Oshodi to Abule Egba will cost N450 from N350 and Abule-Egba-CMS-Obalende will attract a fare of N600.\n\nThe increase, which will come into effect on Wednesday, 13 July 2022, is aimed at ensuring sustainability of the BRT and standard route schemes.\n\nThe Governor in consenting to the fare increase also approved a proposal for a bailout for the bus operating companies (route franchise operators/concessionaires), in order to cushion the effect of the harsh operating environment, safeguard private partnership investment, and forestall the demise of formalised bus operations in the state.\n\nRecently, operations of the transport scheme had been hampered due to rising cost of inputs required for sustainable service offering and the attendant high number of buses out of operation as a result of lack of spare parts.\n\nFor instance, the exponential increase in the pump price of diesel from N187 to N830/litre between August 2020 and June, 2022, had greatly affected optimal performance of the bus operating companies leading to the withdrawal of buses from operation and longer waiting time at bus stations.\n\nIn view of the economic situation, the government is also providing support for the Bus Operating Companies in view of the continuous increase in fuel price. This is to ensure that the increment to the passenger is kept to a minimum.\n\nThe fare increase notwithstanding, government noted that whatever support this would provide to the operators, it would still not cover the cost of fueling, thus likely to put the continued survival of the bus operations on a tight rein.\n\nThe Governor also approved the appeal by the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) for the conversion of the current diesel buses in operation to the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) and a shift to economically viable and environmentally friendly mobility energy solution that are cost efficient and maximize operations cost such as electric vehicles, hydrogen buses and the development of hybrid energy sources as alternative fueling for the current Bus Reform Initiative (BRI) buses.\n\nAccording to the request, \u201cThese measures are indispensable in the current global economic and environmental reality to ensure the sustainability of the BRI operation.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, Wednesday, assured that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would deliver peaceful, transparent, free, fair and credible elections next year, without any form of interference from his administration.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the assurance in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, while speaking at a meeting with representatives of Nigerians living in the country, cautioning the Diaspora Nigerians to also resist the urge to use social media platforms to incite political crisis back home.\n\nThe President, who is in Lisbon on a state visit, told those at the meeting that his administration looks forward to a smooth transition to the next government, assuring again that his government would not compromise taking every right step to assure the welfare of Nigerian citizens, home and abroad.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the President said with the conclusion of the primaries of the political parties, all eyes are now on the 2023 elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018We also look forward to a smooth transition to the next government. As I have said before, our Administration will not compromise on doing the right things and the welfare of Nigerians, home and abroad,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nCiting the last gubernatorial elections in Anambra and Ekiti State, the President noted that his administration has proven consistently its zero tolerance for interference in elections and insistence that Nigerians should be allowed to vote for the party and candidate of their choice.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to caution against the use of social media to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance, urging the Diaspora to always promote Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u2018\u2018The world is a global village and technology has shrunk the world even more. Although you reside beyond Nigeria\u2019s boundaries, you can engage easily with the country. In fact, we see the impact of that engagement clearly on social media.\n\n\u2018\u2018This platform has empowered Nigerians in the diaspora and given you great influence. As we have seen, however, social media can be a force for good as well as a force for evil.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many countries, including our own have had to take strong measures against some social media platforms to curb their excesses and prevent them from destabilizing our societies.\n\n\u2018\u2018I, therefore, call upon you to use social media responsibly. We all want the best for our country and people, so let us strive to build, unite and prosper our nation and people and not to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight in the successful involvement of Diaspora in various fields such as agriculture, health care, education, ICT, and the food industry in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that many countries, including Nigeria, have shown that their diaspora can be a veritable engine for growth and development.\n\nAcknowledging the huge contribution the Diaspora has made to Nigeria\u2019s economy, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018In every field of human endeavour, be it the creative industries, sports, health, academia, Nigerians in the diaspora have thrived and leveraged on their skills to raise our country\u2019s profile higher, economically, socially, technologically and culturally.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is for these reasons that this Government established the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to facilitate and support your engagement with our country for a win-win outcome in our effort to keep Nigerians united at home and abroad.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must continue to be our ambassadors-at-large in your comportment, actions and character.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must excel and be the best in all your endeavours. While here, you must also not forget home as you are the example we want to project to the rest of the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader assured the meeting coordinated by Chairman NIDCOM, Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa that the Federal Government would continue to do everything possible to catalyse development in various fields of the economy.\n\nHe also encouraged them to key into the programmes of NiDCOM, so as to contribute to initiatives such as the Nigerian Diaspora Investment Trust Fund.\n\nNigerian Ambassador to Portugal, Alex Enan Kefas, told President Buhari that records indicate that there are some 3,000 Nigerians living in the country, who are generally well behaved and living peacefully among themselves and the host authorities.\n\nThe Ambassador informed the President of the recent arrest and detention of about thirteen Nigerians for alleged offences of money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nHe explained that the Embassy conducted a consular visit to the prison which revealed that the arrests were \u2018\u2018disproportionate and unjust\u2019\u2019 as many of them were innocent of the allegations.\n\nHe said the Mission is trying its best to ensure the release of the innocent to enable them to reunite with their families.\n\nAt the meeting with the Diaspora, a Nigerian professional footballer, Saviour Godwin, who plays for Portuguese side Casa Pia, presented a jersey to President Buhari.",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja; Uja Emmanuel, Makurdi and Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti\n\nEx-Ekiti governor insists power must shift\n\nBenue governor faults Atiku on Wike\n\nPoor attendance at Osun campaign council initiation\n\nThe post-presidential primary crisis that has engulfed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) escalated yesterday.\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose re-echoed the regional position on zoning, insisting that power should shift to the South.\n\nHe spoke a month after the party concluded its presidential primary in which Alhaji Atiku Abubakar was elected the flag bearer.\n\nAlso, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom decried what he described as Atiku\u2019s \u2018insult\u2019 to Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nHe said Atiku should explain why he did not pick the former presidential aspirant as his running mate.\n\nThe PDP candidate is from Adamawa State in the Northeast zone.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Osun State Governorship Election Campaign Council was inaugurated in Abuja with only two of 13 PDP governors present.\n\nMany leading lights of the 128-member council did not show up.\n\nThe poll holds on July 16 across 30 local governments in the Southwest state.\n\nThere were rumours on social media that PDP National Chairman Dr. Iyorchia Ayu had been suspended.\n\nBut, his Media and Communication Adviser, Simon Imobo-Tswam, urged the public to ignore the misinformation.\n\nHe attributed the report to the antics of mischief makers and idle minds.\n\nOrtom and Fayose had teamed up with Wike during the presidential primary.\n\nAlthough Wike was recommended by 14 of the 17-man committee set up by the party as running mate, Atiku later picked Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nOrtom\u2019s interview with Arise Television gave a hint of a smouldering crisis.\n\nHe alleged that Atiku ignored the recommendation of the committee he set up to consider a suitable running mate for him.\n\nAccording to Ortom, 14 of 17 members, including himself, had recommended Wike.\n\nOrtom said: \u201cI was among the 17-member committee set up by Atiku and 14 of us in the committee said the person should be Wike. Unfortunately, Atiku picked Okowa. That is his wisdom.\n\n\u201cYou cannot ignore the decision of a committee you set up yourself and expect people to be happy. For now, I have gone into hibernation.\u201d\n\nWhen he was asked if he would support the Atiku/Okowa ticket, Ortom was non-committal.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am in hibernation. I am praying. When I finish the prayers and whatever God directs me, I will do. We expect Atiku to do more, but we are not seeing that.\u201d\n\nWhen it was pointed out to Ortom that Atiku has been making efforts to reach out to Wike, who has been avoiding the emissaries\u2019 calls, Ortom justified Wike\u2019s action.\n\nOrtom said: \u201cThey should stop that. Atiku should go to him. Why won\u2019t he ignore their calls? Is that not an insult?\n\n\u201cWike is a pillar in the party. Currently, nobody in the party has contributed more to the party to move forward than Wike.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku was not going to honour the decision of the committee, he should have called Wike earlier and informed him. He didn\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do things anyhow and expect us to be happy.\u201d\n\nOrtom added: \u201cMy friend Wike deserves the vacation after what he has gone through.\n\n\u201cSome of us believe he (Wike) has the capacity and charisma to lift this country from bottom to top compared to what has been happening.\n\n\u201cWe have been taken from the top in 2015 to the bottom since this present administration came into power.\n\n\u201cSome of us believe that Wike has the capacity but Nigerians or let me say the PDP people did not give him the opportunity. Some of us rooted for him.\n\n\u201cI was amongst the 17-member committee that was set up by the candidate himself and the party and some of us said that for the vice presidency of the party, we needed Wike to be the vice president so that he can bridge the gap.\n\n\u201cWe (the committee) said it does not matter whether he supported the presidential candidate or not, all we are looking for is unity and how we can make things work.\u201d\n\nFayose: it\u2019s South\u2019s turn to produce President\n\nFayose insisted that it is the turn of the South to produce the next president after the expiration of two terms of eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe believes it is in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice.\n\nThe former governor disclosed this in a statement via his verified Twitter handle (@GovAyoFayose).\n\nHe argued that Section 3(c) of the PDP Constitution provides for a rotational presidency.\n\nFayose, who did not mention the party and candidate he would be supporting in next year\u2019s election, urged Nigerians to await further details. He tweeted: \u201cThe PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims & objectives by \u2018adhering to the policy of the rotation & zoning of Party & Public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness\u2019.\u201d\n\nPoor attendance at Campaign Council inauguration\n\nThe chairman of the Osun Campaign Council, Governor Douye Diri, did not attend the ceremony.\n\nOkowa and his Taraba State counterpart, Darius Ishaku, were the only two governors that attended the inauguration.\n\nAlmost three weeks ago, PDP had failed to set up a similar campaign structure for Ekiti State ahead of the governorship election.\n\nAlso, PDP governors and national leaders refused to campaign for the candidate, Bisi Kolawole, who lost to the All Progressives Congress (APC) flag bearer, Governor-elect Biodun Oyebanji.\n\nWhile Okowa, who represented Atiku yesterday, explained that the presidential candidate was out of the country, Ishaku said he was representing Diri as deputy chairman of the Campaign Council.\n\nIshaku did not offer any explanations for Diri\u2019s absence.\n\nAyu did not attend the ceremony.\n\nThe Deputy National Chairman (North), Umar Damagum, stood in for Ayu, who was said to be on a two-week vacation and will be resuming on July 6.\n\nMembers of the National Working Committee (NWC) attended the ceremony.\n\nBesides the governors, most of the 128 members of the campaign council also did show up for the ceremony, which kicked off well over an hour behind schedule.\n\nDecrying the report on Ayu\u2019s suspension, PDP Spokesman Debo Ologunagba said: \u201cSuch report is completely false and a product of the imagination of mischief makers with the intent to destabilise our party, create an impression of crisis within our ranks and mislead the unsuspecting members of the public.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the false report is the handiwork of vicious anti-people forces who are agitated by the stability, unity and soaring popularity of our party under the cohesive Sen. Dr. Ayu-led National Working Committee as well as the intimidating statures of our presidential and vice presidential candidates, His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar and His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa respectively.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba said the party chairman has been on a short vacation outside the country and that he officially transmitted power to the Deputy National Chairman (North), Umar Damagum to perform his duties in an acting capacity.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is instructive to state that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was duly informed of the absence of our National Chairman and that Amb. Damagun will be performing the duties of the National Chairman in Acting Capacity pending Senator Dr. Ayu\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the PDP and the NWC are united and Senator Dr. Iyorchia Ayu remains the National Chairman.\n\n\u201cThe NWC, therefore, urges all members of our great party, our teeming supporters, the media and the general public to disregard the said report as fake news,\u201d Ologunagba added.",

          "title": "2023: Cracks in PDP widen as party leaders blast Atiku",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Ndubuisi Orji and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nThere is no letup in the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the emergence of former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, as presidential candidate and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as running mate has continued to draw the ire of some party leaders.\n\nThis is as plot to oust the National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, thickens.\n\nWhile Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State said he was still praying for divine guidance from God before he decides whether or not to support Atiku, former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose, insisted that Atiku\u2019s emergence was a breach of the party\u2019s principle of power rotation between the north and the south.\n\nGovernor Ortom, who lamented that injustice was done to the Rivers Governor, said he can only support the presidential flag bearer if directed by God.\n\nWike had come second to Atiku during the PDP\u2019s presidential primary in May. Following Atiku\u2019s victory, a committee was set up by the party to choose his running mate. It was reported that among the three nominees presented to the committee, Wike scored the highest votes, but Atiku chose Governor Okowa, a decision that infuriated some of the governors who backed Wike for the position.\n\nThe PDP leadership had set up a committee with the mandate of nominating and submitting three names of probable candidates for the position of running mate to Atiku.\n\nAgainst widespread speculation that majority of members of the committee voted for Wike, the party had explained that the brief given to the committee did not include voting, but to nominate three names which would be forwarded to the standard bearer to choose from.\n\nAPC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi,... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video APC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi, 9 others\n\nWhile announcing Okowa as running mate, Atiku said: \u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom. In these consultations, I made it clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting. In other words, the person must have the qualities to be president.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ortom who spoke in a television interview, yesterday, said Wike was not consulted before the selection process despite his monumental support for the party over the years, even when other prominent faithful backed out\n\nHe said if Abubakar knew he had Okowa in mind, a panel should not have been set up in the first place to screen.\n\nOrtom said for peace to reign and for PDP to make a head way in next year\u2019s elections, the national leadership of the PDP should visit Wike and mend fences.\n\n\u201cWhen people ran away from this party, Wike was on the ground. Wike was the one that made me to return to PDP. Injustice was done to me in 2015, it was Wike that came here and convinced me to come to PDP. I came to PDP, we were working and you do injustice to him and you think he would keep quiet. This is not fair. I believe in justice, equity and fairness. It is not enough to say you will put a call to him, it is an insult to put a call to him, you go to him.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership at the national level should go to Wike and appeal to him. Wike is a pillar of this party, everybody knows. Wike was second to Atiku. Atiku should go to him but it is unfair to say that you just put a call to Wike. I have no problem with Okowa. Okowa is my friend. But Wike should have been consulted and spoken to. But the truth is that Wike should have been consulted in the first place even before the announcement because, like I said, 14 people said Wike should be the vice. If that was not going to work, he should have been told. The people at the leadership are to be blamed. They would have allowed Wike to have first hand information.\u201d\n\nHe said he was still praying for divine guidance from God before he decides whether or not to support Atiku.\n\n\u201cSome of us have resorted to prayers. I have been in hibernation. We\u2019ve resorted to prayer: \u2018Lord God, where do we go from here.\u2019 I believe as a Christian that power belongs to God. The Bible says a man can receive nothing, except it is given to him from above.\n\n\u201cI am praying. I have gone into hibernation. I am fasting and praying. So in the end, if God directs me that I should support Atiku, why should I not do it? After all, he\u2019s my party member. But I am waiting for him to do more. I expect him to reach out to Wike, who came second in the presidential primary\u2026I expect more explanations. I expect him to talk to Wike who we are supporting first. I expect him to reach out to some of us so that together we can work as a party.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Fayose said on his official twitter handle that after having a president from the north for eight years, Nigeria\u2019s next president must come from the south.\n\n\u201cThe PDP constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the party shall pursue its aims and objectives by \u201cadhering to the policy of the rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe current president of Nigeria is a two-term northern presidency, thus implying that it must be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or nothing. Awa \u2018South\u2019 lo kan\u2019. Nigerians should await details soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Group backs Atiku, berates Ortom\n\nHowever, the Centre for Integrity and Good Governance (CIGG) said the choice of who becomes running mate is the constitutional prerogative of Atiku.\n\nIn a statement by its convener, Mr. Waheed Aderibigbe and Co-convener, Mr. Obinna Ukariaku, it expressed shock that some Nigerians would jettison the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic and choose to play to the gallery or even base their argument on emotional sentiments.\n\nIt cited Section 142 (1) of the 1999 constitution which states: \u201cIn any election to which the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Chapter relate, a candidate for an election to the office of president shall not be deemed to be validly nominated unless he nominates another candidate as his associate from the same political party for his running for the office of president, who is to occupy the office of vice-president and that candidate shall be deemed to have been duly elected to the office of vice president if the candidate for an election to the office of President, who nominated him as such associate is duly elected as President in accordance with the provisions aforesaid.\u201d\n\nThe group said Atiku in fidelity to the extant law exercised this power and privilege which the constitution vested in him, stressing that any input from the party stakeholders including the National Working Committee, the Board of Trustees (BoT), elders of the party, among others, is advisory.\n\nThe Centre faulted Governor Ortom, who said the party would have picked Governor Wike as Atiku\u2019s running mate.",

So, you must understand that we have continued as a party to play our part and the youth wing of the party has continued to rise to the occasion to mobilise the young people of our generation. While we are not threatened, we are not sitting on our hands, we are taking responsibility. And that is why we have this dynamic crop of young people who are passionate about change, because we believe that the future of the party belongs to us. That is why we have co-opted all of these dynamic gentlemen to come together, to see that we must also begin to mobilise young people in our own party\u2026\n\n\u201cYes, we are not threatened, but at the same time, we are not expecting a miracle to happen.\u201d\n\nIsrael said the national taskforce was for the registration and revalidation of youth-led and youth/student focused support group for 2023 presidential election. \u201cWe are doing the job and this is part of doing the job. We want to document all our support groups. We will then begin to create programmes and activities for them. We are going to train them, we are going to give them skills.

          "text": "Michael Olugbode in Damaturu\n\nYobe State Governor, Hon. Mai Mala Buni has launched Free Healthcare Service Schemes for poor and vulnerable people in the State.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the scheme in Damaturu, the governor said: \u201cThe new expanded and remodeled Free Healthcare Schemes which we are launching today, will greatly improve the accessibility of high-quality and effective healthcare services in the State, particularly to the poor and vulnerable people to achieve long-term universal health coverage and promote a healthy and productive society. This new scheme will sustain and improve the gains of the former Free drugs programme for the benefit of our citizens.\n\n\u201cThe new Scheme is a complete package fused into a single framework comprising the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund, the State Equity Programme, and the subsidized formal sector programme. It also includes Deferral and Exemptions and Free Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health {MNCH} programmes that are both operational at health facility levels. These are all aimed to improve access and provide qualitative and affordable healthcare services to our teeming people especially the poor, and the vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cI am also happy to once again launch and present to the public the YSCHMA Informal Sector Programme that will provide a prescribed package of healthcare services at uniform contributions of NGN12,000 per person per annum, accessible to all self-employed residents at the grassroots.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the inception of our administration, we have sustained both financial and administrative commitment to the implementation of the former free Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health services (MNCH) programmes in the state.\n\nThis administration has introduced other laudable initiatives such as the establishment of Yobe State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency {YOCHMA} and Yobe State Drug and\n\nMedical Consumables Management Agency [YODMA] to primarily expand healthcare financing fiscal space and ensure sustainable supply and availability of high-quality, safe, affordable, and accessible drugs, reagents, and other medical consumables at all times, in all the health facilities across the state.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that: \u201cSince the commencement of Contributory Healthcare Financing by this administration, the State Government has consistently sustained the employer statutory 3.25% contribution into the formal sector programme from June 2020 to date amounting to Two billion, six hundred and forty-two million, nine hundred- and forty-four-Naira eighty-four kobo (N2,642,670,944.84). This in addition to providing two hundred million Naira (N200,000,000.00) in the year 2021 for the state government equity programme that is currently being implemented under the State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency.\u201d\n\nBuni said: \u201cFurthermore, with effect from last month, I approved the restoration of the monthly standing payment for the Free drugs program to Twenty million Naira (N20,000,000) and bulk purchase of drugs and medical consumables amounting to the sum of Forty million Naira to the State Ministry of Health (N40,000,000.00) to expand and remodel the existing Free MNCH programme in the state through direct procurement and distribution of high-quality drugs, medical consumables, and laboratory reagents to health facilities across the state.\u201d\n\nIn this respect, let me call on our political leaders, individuals and\n\ncorporate bodies at all levels to personally through the state contributory agency pay and enroll their constituents into the Yobe State Government Informal sector programme through the payment of the required N12,000 premium contribution per person per annum to increase access to affordable healthcare at the grassroots. Personally, I am announcing a donation of One million Two hundred thousand Naira only (N1,200,000.00) for the enrolment of 100 vulnerable persons. The Hon. Commissioner for Health is hereby directed to supervise the identification, selection, and enrollment to ensure they are equitably accessing healthcare in their chosen facilities.",

          "text": "* Reiterates commitment to peaceful, credible polls in 2023\n\n* Warns against use of social media to incite people\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared that his administration will not in any form interfere in elections conducted across the country by the electoral umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nSpeaking in Lisbon at a meeting with representatives of Nigerians living in Portugal, the president, while citing the recent gubernatorial elections in Anambra and Ekiti States, noted that his government has proven consistently its zero tolerance for interference in elections.\n\nHe insisted that Nigerians should be allowed to vote for the party and candidate of their choice when the need arises.\n\nPresident Buhari also gave assurances of a free hand to INEC, reiterating the commitment of his administration to ensure that the commission (INEC) delivers peaceful, transparent, free, fair and credible elections next year.\n\nHe stressed that with the conclusion of the primaries of the political parties, all eyes are now on the 2023 elections in Nigeria.\n\nHis words: \u2018\u2018We also look forward to a smooth transition to the next government. As I have said before, our administration will not compromise on doing the right things and the welfare of Nigerians, home and abroad.\u201d\n\nThe president also used the occasion to caution against the use of social media to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance, urging the Diaspora to always promote Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u2018\u2018The world is a global village and technology has shrunk the world even more. Although you reside beyond Nigeria\u2019s boundaries, you can engage easily with the country. In fact, we see the impact of that engagement clearly on social media.\n\n\u2018\u2018This platform has empowered Nigerians in the diaspora and given you great influence. As we have seen, however, social media can be a force for good as well as a force for evil.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many countries, including our own have had to take strong measures against some social media platforms to curb their excesses and prevent them from destabilizing our societies.\n\n\u2018\u2018I, therefore, call upon you to use social media responsibly. We all want the best for our country and people, so let us strive to build, unite and prosper our nation and people and not to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight in the successful involvement of diaspora in various fields such as agriculture, health care, education, ICT, and the food industry in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that many countries, including Nigeria, have shown that their diaspora can be a veritable engine for growth and development.\n\nAcknowledging the huge contribution the diaspora has made to Nigeria\u2019s economy, the president said: \u2018\u2018In every field of human endeavour, be it the creative industries, sports, health, academia, Nigerians in the diaspora have thrived and leveraged on their skills to raise our country\u2019s profile higher, economically, socially, technologically and culturally.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is for these reasons that this government established the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to facilitate and support your engagement with our country for a win-win outcome in our effort to keep Nigerians united at home and abroad.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must continue to be our ambassadors-at-large in your comportment, actions and character.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must excel and be the best in all your endeavours. While here, you must also not forget home as you are the example we want to project to the rest of the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari assured the meeting coordinated by the Chairman of Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, that the federal government would continue to do everything possible to catalyse development in various fields of the economy.\n\nHe also encouraged them to key into the programmes of NIDCOM, so as to contribute to initiatives such as the Nigerian Diaspora Investment Trust Fund.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Nigerian Ambassador to Portugal, Alex Enan Kefas, told President Buhari that records indicate that there are some 3,000 Nigerians living in the country, who are generally well behaved and living peacefully among themselves and the host authorities.\n\nThe envoy informed the president of the recent arrest and detention of about 13 Nigerians for alleged offences of money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nAccording to him, the Embassy conducted a consular visit to the prison which revealed that the arrests were \u2018\u2018disproportionate and unjust\u2019\u2019, as many of them were innocent of the allegations.\n\nHe said the Mission is trying its best to ensure the release of the innocent to enable them reunite with their families.",

We don\u2019t make empty promises.\n\n\u201cIt is better to begin with a step to go in the right direction than not to take a step at all. We are convinced that before the twilight of the first tenure of this administration, that project will be completed. That is our target.\u201d\n\nThe governor pointed out that the main wealth of the state was in the sea, and said that the state government is determined to open up the state to the Atlantic Ocean from three flanks.\n\nHe also noted that substantial progress was being made on the ongoing Bayelsa West and Central Senatorial Roads.\n\nHe also disclosed that asphalt had been laid up to Ayamasa, and in a few weeks\u2019 time, Aleibiri in Ekeremor Local Government Area would be linked up to ensure smooth drive from Toru-Orua, where the present administration took up the project.\n\nDiri said: \u201cAs you are aware, our wealth is in the sea and our desire is to take us and ensure that we get to the Atlantic from the three flanks. We are making good progress on the Bayelsa West Road.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, asphalt has been laid up to Ayamasa and beyond. In a couple of weeks, we should be able to link to Aleibiri and you will have smooth drive from Toru-Orua from where we resumed construction, up to Amanagbene where our asphalt is sitting and working hard to get to Ekeremor main town.\n\n\u201cWe are very sure that with the resources that are coming our way, we should be able to take the next phase that would take us from Ekeremor to Agge.\u201d\n\nHe also used the opportunity to commend and encourage the state male and female basketball teams who would be participating in this year\u2019s Nestle Milo National Basketball Tournament for Secondary Schools that would hold in Lagos State.\n\nThe governor expressed delight that both Saint Jude\u2019s Girls Secondary School and the Bishop Dimeari Grammar School (BDGS) teams have qualified for the finals and would definitely make the state proud again by coming up tops in their different categories.\n\nDiri also absolved the state government of any blame on the protracted power outage in the state.\n\nHe clarified that the generation, distribution and transmission of electricity in Nigeria through the national grid was on the Exclusive List.\n\nWhile empathising with the people over the worrisome development, he appealed to them to show understanding and not to point accusing fingers at the state government, adding that his administration has been relating closely with relevant federal agencies to solve the problem.\n\nDiri also used the opportunity to remind the youths of Bayelsa State to direct their energies to productive ventures by investing their time in activities that are devoid of crime and criminality.\n\nHe advised them to take full advantage of the various opportunities that the state government has created for them, disclosing that no fewer than 150 youths were currently being trained in the second batch of beneficiaries of the Diri Digital Entrepreneurship Empowerment Programme (D-DEEP).",

          "text": "Ugo Aliogo in this report writes on the First Bank Nigeria Limited verve campaign designed to reward customers\n\nAs an age long bank institution in Nigeria, customer satisfaction is at the centre of its brand promise. For First Bank Limited, the dream is beyond customer satisfaction because the bank is committed to see how the economy is impacted positively, businesses are supported with the needed financial interventions, and small businesses grow to become big conglomerates. Therefore, the bank\u2019s mantra \u2018woven into the fabric of the society\u2019 is a sentence coined from the bank\u2019s decades of impact to the society and communities where it transacts businesses.\n\nIn line with the bank\u2019s commitment to continue in the business of transforming lives, recently the bank rewarded customers with 50-million-naira worth of prizes in verve card campaign. The promo is designed to reward customers for their continued usage of the Verve debit Card.\n\nThe eight-week promo which ended provided opportunity for 2,601 customers to win various prizes. These prizes include: N20,000 Cash Prize, N10,000 Cash Prize, N10,000 worth of airtime; power generating sets, refrigerators, cooking gas and the grand prize of a brand-new car.\n\nThe promo rewarded customers on a weekly and monthly basis. In every week of the promo, 200 customers who carried out a minimum of 2 transactions with their Verve debit card stood a chance to win N10,000 worth of airtime, cash prizes of N10,000 and N20,000.\n\nFurthermore, 100 customers who performed a minimum of eight transactions within four weeks with their verve debit card was rewarded with either a power generating set, refrigerator, gas cooker or N50,000 cash prize every four weeks.\n\nA grand prize of a brand-new car was also won by a lucky customer who performed a minimum of 16 transactions during the campaign period.\n\nSpeaking about the promo, Group Executive, e-Business and Retail Products, First Bank Nigeria Limited, Chuma Ezirim, said: \u201cWe are happy with the ongoing verve debit card promo designed to appreciate customers for their continued usage and adoption of the card for various digitally-driven transactions. With the promo being instrumental to reinforcing the value placed by customers on its versatile capabilities, we encourage the continued usage of the verve card as it is a card offering that promotes safe, convenient and rewarding digital banking service to customers.\u201d\n\nOne of the excited winners, Kunle Aluko stated that when he received the Short Message Service (SMS), informing him that he has been selected as one of the winners, he didn\u2019t believe it at first because messages abound especially those used by online fraudsters to scam vulnerable individuals who fall prey into their hands, so he did not give heed to it at first.\n\n\u201cBut I decided to visit First Bank head office to confirm and it was confirmed to be true. But after two weeks, I was worried when I didn\u2019t receive the call, then I made a call through one of the banks\u2019 customer care lines and called to collect my gift. I am very excited to receive the items from the bank. I want to thank bank for this initiative and promised to continue banking with them.\u201d\n\nAnother winner, Ajao Abiola, said: I was sleeping when my phone rang and I didn\u2019t take it seriously, because I contest for anything and someone just phoned and said I won something, there was nothing like a raffle draw that I was aware of. So I went back to bed, but a day after, I received another call. The caller said she phoned to remind me that at 10a.m, I need to be at First Bank, so I discussed with my husband and he told me to give it a try, that nobody will steal in front of the bank. To be sincere, I am so surprised to be here and I am happy because I was not expecting it. My prayer for the bank is that they will continue to be number one in the bank industry in Nigeria. They have really tried and shown so much resilience as an institution.\u201d",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Waziri Adio on why he set up a think tank on public policy -- and how Nigeria can change",
          "text": "Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, speaks with IDRIS SHEHU on Agora Policy, the think tank and non-profit he just launched \u201cto find practical solutions to urgent national challenges\u201d. The think tank, he says, will conduct policy research, facilitate frank and purposeful dialogues, and build capacity for governance, policy and advocacy\n\nYou left NEITI last year after a five-year, non-renewable tenure. What have you been up to, apart from publishing your memoir?\n\nBasically, I have been trying to catch my breath and clear my head, and also trying to get some important things done. About a month after I left government, I went to the University of Oxford as a visiting fellow. I was there for three months. As you mentioned, I have also documented and published my experience in running a federal government agency in Nigeria. The book, \u2018The Arc of the Possible,\u2019 was published by Cable Books in December 2021, about nine months after I left government. After I got the book out of the way, I returned to the media, my first love. I was appointed as Contributing Editor to the THISDAY/ARISE Group early this year. In that role, I sit on the editorial board of THISDAY, write a weekly column on the back-page of the Sunday newspaper, and do on-air analysis for ARISE TV. I have also devoted some considerable time to setting up a research institution on an area I am very passionate about, which is public policy. I have founded Agora Policy, a think tank that focuses on developing practical solutions to urgent national challenges. So, it has been 16 months of resting, reflecting, documenting, engaging, and of setting out in old and new territories. I have been busy.\n\nHow was the reception to the book?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpectacular, I will say. When I decided to write the book, I wasn\u2019t too sure how the reception would be, not sure if there was an appetite for that kind of book here, or if the book would not be mis-read or misinterpreted. But the reception has surpassed my expectations. Sale has been good. The book was on Roving Heights bestsellers\u2019 list for many months, and is still in demand. The reviews have been amazing. I have received fantastic feedbacks from readers far and wide. Some of the comments are touching and humbling at the same time. And most of these from people way outside of my network. I am impressed that people have taken the time to read a non-gossipy and sometimes dense book about governance. But I am more impressed and humbled about the impact some of them said the book has had on them or their worldview. We are following up with a series of events around the country to ensure that we can have robust and frank conversations around the key messages of the book and that we can take the message forward. I am glad I found the time to document my experience. I think all those who have the privilege of serving the country should document their experiences for those coming behind them to learn from and to enrich our knowledge of the realities, the challenges and the possibilities of public service in our country.\n\nYou\u2019ve not only commented on public affairs as a respected journalist and columnist, but you also tested the water of public service as NEITI\u2019s executive secretary. What is the drive behind your latest participation in public policy shaping?\n\nI think there is a connecting thread in the three spaces that you have mentioned. And it is about service. The most obvious form of public service is working in government. But journalism is public service too. And the think tank I am working on is definitely about public service. As I mentioned earlier, we will be focusing on helping to generate solutions to urgent national challenges. You can\u2019t get more public or more service than that. So, it is always about how much more public value we can create in the spaces available. Linking these spaces is not a new interest for me though, even if I have not always articulated it this way. In 2001/2002, I had a journalism fellowship at Harvard University, called the Nieman Fellowship. My research interest then was an exploration of the intersection between the press, politics and public policy. It wasn\u2019t planned, but that is exactly the direction I have travelled. I have always been interested in how to solve problems, how to create more value. As a journalist, I moved from criticism to prescription. My work in NEITI was driven by solving problems, and revolved around layering policy research and advocacy on the core mandate of the organisation. We created a department for policy. And if you remember, we were churning out policy papers, outside of the standard audit reports. In fact, for the five years I spent there, we had an average of a policy paper every two months, some in book-length format.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I am doing now is to take that work forward, much beyond the extractive governance space and in a more structured way, albeit outside of government. The primary arena of policy is government. But that is not the sole arena of policy. In fact, being outside of government but understanding how government works and having purchase with both the government and the larger society can be very useful. In Western countries, especially in the United States where there is a profusion of think tanks, most of the great policy ideas even originate outside of government.\n\nI have training in public administration, management and public policy, also from Harvard. After the fellowship I mentioned earlier, I returned for a master\u2019s from the Kennedy School of Government. With that background, and having worked outside and inside of government, I can see that we are not leveraging the policy process enough for national development in this country. There are so many gaps. Policies are largely driven by whims or merely handed down without proper consideration of context. The public is mostly missing from the policy design process. The level of deliberation and participation is low, which limits consensus-building on one hand and hardens resistance on the other. Then, the capacity for policy formulation, design and implementation, in fact the overall capacity for governance across the three tiers, is quite thin. Agora Policy is designed to contribute to the process of addressing these gaps. By the way, Agora means \u201cpublic\u201d in Greek.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s current situation would you say the country needs more policies or institutional/system strengthening?\n\nI don\u2019t think it is an either/or thing or that we have that luxury of picking one over the other. We need both. We need to do more of both. We need to make better, more effective and more appropriate policies. We need to strengthen the capacities of our institutions and systems to deliver effective and appropriate policies in particular and good governance in general. Most importantly, we need to upscale the human capacity to design and implement great policies and good governance. The capacity thing is what we always gloss over. But state capacity is generally abysmal, and I am not just talking of the sub-national level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat area of public policy will the think tank be focusing on: research or advocacy?\n\nAgora Policy will focus, for now, on economic, governance, social and environmental policies. The core of Agora Policy\u2019s work will be policy research, aimed at generating practical solutions to challenges in those areas. The research will have academic depth but will not be presented in academic format or language and will not be just research. For example, it will not be research just to establish if there is a link between A and B or to investigate what causes Z. This will be research that is solution-oriented. About what needs to be done, based on carefully considered evidence and assessment of options, and possibly about how to move the needle on thorny issues. The emphasis will be on actionable recommendations, based on evidence. This is what think tanks do. They serve as incubators of ideas. But in addition to generating and incubating ideas, we will also provide a trusted platform for honest conversations between policy makers and other policy actors, to ensure an all-of-society and more inclusive, and therefore more sustainable approach to policy making. The third thing we will be focusing on is capacity building across the board, from capacity for policy formulation to capacity for policy monitoring and advocacy. Earlier, I mentioned gaps that we have observed in policy making in Nigeria. Our response to those gaps, or our theory of change if you will, can be captured with three words: evidence, dialogue, capacity.\n\nGiven your previous role in the field as a former public office holder, what are lessons learnt that stand your think tank apart from the numerous established?\n\nThe first thing that I need to say is that we need many more think tanks in this country. Even in countries where you have the best academic institutions and where governance deficit is not as dire as we have here, they still have hundreds of top-notch think tanks, from partisan ones to independent ones. We need as many Brookings Institution, Carnegie, Chatham House, Centre for Strategic and International Studies, RAND Corporation and others as we can have. So, we need more think tanks, not fewer. Different think tanks focus on different things. What I think will differentiate us will be our understanding of how government works, the credibility that comes with being independent and being seen as a honest broker between state and non-state actors, and the obsession with finding workable solutions, not finding faults.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the concluding part of The Arc of The Possible, you called for more professional, morally upright people to get into government. Why do you keep advocating this trend despite your expos\u00e9 of how skewed the system has become?\n\nI sincerely believe change is possible and that we need all the competent and upright people we can get to improve governance in our country. But I do not think of this as a binary. So, I am not saying all the people within the system are incompetent and corrupt. Nor am I saying all those with professional backgrounds are competent and upright. My first point is that we need people with fresh ideas and with fresh eyes in governance in Nigeria, not just those interested in perpetuating the status quo. Whether these people are from within or from outside government, we need them in sizeable number, a critical mass, if you will. We people who really want to make the difference, who know how to get things done in the public sector, and who can do this while upholding important values. I believe there are many people who can do this but they also need to see what it is possible and they need to be guided, especially on how to avoid landmines planted for just people like them. That\u2019s one of the key messages in the book. But I also made the point that individual example is not enough. We need to reform the overall environment in which individuals operate. The operating environment conditions behaviour. I concluded that chapter of the book with a line like this: while individual example is key, the environment is king.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Nigeria gearing for a change of administration in 2023, what sort of policies would you advise the next government to prioritise?\n\nWe are actually working on a set of policy papers on the key challenges facing the country. We want to work with others to steer the debate from the predictable focus on personalities to emphasis on key developmental issues and challenges. While there is use in focusing on personalities, especially in assessing the fit for the positions, we think that should not obscure or be at the expense of the need to beam an intense light on the critical challenges facing the country now and the prescriptions of those offering to lead the country at this critical moment. We also plan to provide a platform for informed conversations and deliberations with political actors on the issues, their understanding of them and their prescriptions before and after the elections. We will roll out publicly with these activities. We have received the commitment of a major foundation to support us on this. We will provide more details soon.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "\u201cThe future of work for African startups is in distributed offices\u201d and other ideas from VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences",
          "text": "May 14\n\nAt about 5:45 PM CET on May 14, I arrived at the Gare du Nord station in Paris, France. It was rowdy, with a mix of different people who had just arrived in the city or were about to leave. A typical sight at one of the city\u2019s 6 large mainline railway station terminals.\n\nI had travelled to Paris for VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences. Founded in 2016, VivaTech has hosted 36,000 startups, 3,300 investors, and numerous business leaders and innovators such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and Tim Cook.\n\nI planned to arrive a few hours earlier for the Viva AfricArena event at Station F, but a 90-minute train delay made it impossible.\n\nMy first stop was Rue Montorgueil, a street lined with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bakeries, fish stores, cheese shops, and wine shops. About 100 VivaTech attendees filled the street chatting and drinking at Viva Night, a networking event.\n\nTo satisfy my hunger, I bought shawarma\u2014starting with familiar food\u2014and a drink, before going on to chat with a few startup founders from Africa and Europe.\n\nExhausted from a long day of dragging my suitcases around, I decided to book an Uber to my Airbnb, so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep asking people for directions.\n\nOver the course of the 45-minute ride, I had a light-hearted conversation with the driver who lives in Paris but is from Algeria. His English wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was good enough for him to dish out some words of advice on why I should get married soon.\n\n\u201cJe parle Anglais,\u201d was a standard disclaimer I gave to almost everyone who started speaking to me in French, telling them that I only speak English. Growing up, I had learnt French at every level of my education but was never in the right environment long enough to practise speaking it.\n\nLater, as I settled into my Airbnb room, I made an attempt to watch TV but embarrassingly caught myself scrolling through the stations, looking for an English-speaking channel. So much for using not being in the right environment as an excuse for my incapacity with French. I didn\u2019t bother turning on the TV after that day.\n\nMay 15\n\nAt 9:59 AM, I arrived at the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. There was a large crowd outside the venue waiting to enter. I was about an hour late because I had to get a SIM card to wean myself off my dependence on public WiFi.\n\nThe conference started on a high note with a teeming crowd and positive energy. After a bit of queuing, I got inside and was fascinated to see more than 100 African startups present\u2014most of them serving francophone African countries.\n\nIt felt odd that there was no Nigerian booth at the conference, considering that countries like Egypt and South Africa had booths. I later learned from someone involved in trying to organise a Nigerian delegation that the current focus on the 2023 election cycle was a major reason why the government didn\u2019t sponsor a delegation.\n\nOver the next few days at the conference, talking to many of these startups made me more aware of the francophone African tech ecosystem and the different people and organisations working to make it thrive.\n\nConversations and sessions\n\nWith startups stationed in shared 3-by-3-metre booths all over the conference venue, I walked to different booths seeking to learn more about what they did.\n\nI spoke to Julien Herbin of Kayfo Games, a startup based in Senegal, who explained that making games from Dakar had a few limitations as he couldn\u2019t monetise the business through in-app purchases because Senegal didn\u2019t have an agreement with Google and Apple on taxation and revenue share, thereby limiting his revenue streams to only advertising.\n\nFinding a place to park in African cities can often be a hassle. Senegalese Lamine Ba of Parcsmart, explained to me that solving the problem of parking in Senegal and other African cities could lead to more efficient use of land and how parking can be a significant revenue stream for businesses.\n\nYanick Kemayou of Kabakoo Academies (Mali), whose edtech solution is helping youths acquire critical competencies such as programming and design, for success in a fast-moving world, was generous in explaining his business model and later helping me get a city transport card to aid my movement around the city.\n\nI also chatted with Singaporean-French serial entrepreneur and now investor, Lin Dejean Yun of Transcendence VC, who explained why she\u2019s bullish on francophone Africa: it\u2019s an untapped market.\n\nOn different occasions, I listened to a pitch by Lew Kam of Easy Matatu (Uganda)\u2014one of the 3 finalists in the Climate Tech Awards\u2014on how they are reducing carbon emissions by streamlining mobility.\n\nDr Rasha Rady of Chefaa (Egypt) spoke about learning to pitch to investors as a female founder on a panel session about women in tech.\n\nCameroonian tech founder and investor, Rebecca Enonchong, gave a passionate talk on her struggles as an entrepreneur and why African entrepreneurs are better adapted to surmount new challenges.\n\n\u201cStartups in Africa, in my opinion, are less risky than startups in other parts of the world because of our resilience as entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe [African entrepreneurs] are very adapted for challenges, and we\u2019re able to surmount challenges unlike any other ecosystem entrepreneurs that I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Here\u2019s a 2-minute clip of her speech.\n\nI also listened to a panel on the future of work. Gregoire Schwebig, CEO AfricaWorks, suggested that maybe Africa doesn\u2019t need to rely on Western ideas of going fully remote due to its current infrastructural problems. The future he suggested is in distributed offices: rather than having one office, companies could have offices all-around cities, closer to employees. The idea rings nice to me, but I wonder how affordable it is.\n\nSince it was launched in 2018, the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) has granted 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out to startups and helped transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem. Mame Aby Seye, General Delegate for Youth and Women Entrepreneurship, spoke about the achievements of the Senegalese tech ecosystem and the support given by the DER to make this possible.\n\nFood\n\nAfter eating shawarma on my first day in Paris, I had more sandwiches, croissants, and pizza over the next 2 days, and then I started craving Nigerian food\u2014I was tired of meals with flour. Fortunately, I ate sea bass, Turkish food, which made my taste buds come alive.\n\nOn Friday evening, I got to eat some Nigerian fried rice cooked by a Nigerian friend who was also at the conference.\n\nOutside African tech\n\nIndia was recognised as Country of the Year at VivaTech, a special recognition given due to the contribution of Indian startups to the world. India has 100 unicorns\u2014one out of every 10 unicorns comes from India.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, and other notable innovators and leaders were also present at the conference.\n\nFour years ago, Huawei launched its app gallery to the rest of the world, making a concerted effort to move beyond Google and build its own ecosystem of products that tie together. During a session by Huawei, the company shared that it has over 432 billion downloads and over 580 million monthly average users (MAU), as of 2021\u2014and that less than 10% of those came from Europe. The number of users from Africa wasn\u2019t shared, most likely because the session was more relevant to a European audience. The Huawei operating system has 5.4 million registered developers and over 187,000 apps are already integrated into it.\n\nThat\u2019s a small figure compared to Google, which had 3.48 million apps on Playstore as of Q1 2021, and 111.3 billion apps downloaded as of 2022. But still, it is a sign that Huawei has made progress over the years. The company also displayed some of its machine learning capabilities. Here\u2019s a video of a demonstration of that.\n\nFashion and tech\n\nAmid the 2,000 exhibitors at the conference, I learned that fashion and beauty brands like Fendi, Bulgari, and Dior were doing more than just creating outfits in the metaverse. Bulgari had an interactive display that enabled clients to create a 3D image of a piece of jewellery in the metaverse, which can then be minted into an NFT. Christian Dior partnered with Lucibel, a French company that designs and manufactures new-generation lighting products and solutions based on LED technology, to create this mask that uses cold red light to stimulate and regenerate skin cells within 12 minutes, without the risk of burning. I didn\u2019t get to try it, but someone who did mentioned that it\u2019s like a substitute for Botox, given that it tightens the skin and straightens out wrinkles.\n\nFendi teamed up with a startup to create an interactive game that gave users the ability to recreate a limited edition bag in order to experience how it was created by craftsmen in Italy. It took 900 hours to create one bag.\n\nSome of these demonstrations were a strategy to get the attention of passers-by, and others were meant to build affinity with the brand by asking users to create fashion items virtually.\n\nLa fin\n\nSaturday, May 18 was the hottest day of the year so far in France, and I felt every degree of it. Many people stayed indoors, and those who went outside were dressed lightly. At its peak, temperatures rose to about 32\u00b0C\u2014Lagos was 26\u00b0C. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how the heat from Lagos followed me to Paris.\n\nSaturday was mostly dedicated to conference sessions held in French\u2014most sessions without translators, presenting me with the perfect opportunity to visit more booths and meet more people.\n\nLater in the evening, after 4 days of learning about tech and showcasing tech products and services, VivaTech 2022 came to an end with music from French DJ Hadrien Federiconi, better known by his stage name Feder. The Africa Tech section hosted ace Congolese guitarist Olivier Tshimanga, who dished out some melodic tunes. The Congolese delegates sure do know how to end a conference in style.\n\nVivaTech 2022 recorded about 91,000 in-person visitors and 300,000 online visits from 146 countries. There were 1,800 startups and 700 investment funds.\n\nAfter an exhilarating week, the next day, I made sure to visit the Eiffel Tower before leaving Paris.\n\nAs I got closer, I didn\u2019t find the Eiffel Tower impressive, seeing that it was one tall structure made up of connected metals. But as soon as I made it to the top, my opinion changed; the experience was beautiful.\n\nAu revoir, mes amis!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abeg\u2019s future lies in its rebrand to a social commerce platform",
          "text": "Payment app, Abeg, has rebranded and will now be called PocketApp, a move that underlines its transition from a payment app to a social commerce app. In addition, Abeg, a subsidiary of Piggytech Global Limited, secured approval-in-principle (AIP) for a mobile money operator (MMO) license application from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the scope of its social commerce operations across the country.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Dare Adekoya, Muheez Akanni, Patricia Adoga and Eniola Ajayi-Bembe as a platform that allows users, mostly Gen Z, to send and request money through a wallet-based system, it enjoyed some virality on Twitter due to its catchy name\u2014derived from a Nigerian slag used to ask for favours. It got downloaded 5,000 times in its first 2 weeks. However, it didn\u2019t gain massive prominence until it became headline sponsor of Big Brother Nigeria (BBN), the most-watched reality TV show in Africa, in 2021. Abeg was acquired by Piggytech Global just before the show began airing, and while it entered the show with 20,000 users on its newly launched app, it claimed to have amassed almost 2 million users by the time the show ended. But after blitzscaling to millions of users in a couple of months, its success was trailed by questions about whether it could retain those users.\n\nPiggytech Global co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Joshua Chibueze told TechCabal that PocketApp is the answer to that question. \u201cSo, what we did last year was to get everyone to get the app first. It was very successful, we got over a million users. But this time around, we are going for retention, we\u2019re trying to create a brand or an app that everyone can use. But for now, we\u2019re targeting small micro-businesses and people who sell on Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nPocketApp will support seamless payments and online commerce throughout the country by adding new functionalities for users to buy and sell items via virtual Pocket shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much focused on people being able to open a pocket shop and sell online for free. Over 65% of Piggvest\u2019s current users sell something, it made sense for us because we\u2019re trying to create extra value for our current customers,\u201d Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp has expressed interest in tapping into Nigeria\u2019s social commerce market which is estimated to reach US$23.8 billion by 2028.\n\nThe MMO license will allow the PocketApp to issue e-money, create and manage wallet creation, enable USSD, recruit, manage and pay money to its agent, and manage pool accounts\u2014all of which are central to expanding social commerce.\n\nPocketApp, like MTN and Airtel, who have received similar approvals-in-principle in the past year, also voiced its support to the Nigerian government\u2019s goals for financial inclusion. \u201cPocketApp affirms its commitment to the financial inclusion agenda of the CBN and the Federal Republic of Nigeria and will continue to make it easier for our teeming young population to seamlessly carry out their transactions while saving them costs and giving them more access to get paid,\u201d it said in a statement sent to TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp COO, Patricia Adoga, said that the PocketApp infrastructure has been in the works for over 18 months to enable secure social commerce because social commerce thrives better in a more trusted environment. \u201cSo we added escrow to our payment infrastructure, protecting buyers and sellers and many other features, ensuring a smooth shopping experience on the app,\u201d Adoga said in a statement.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as a full social commerce app, it will connect buyers and sellers across Nigeria, and soon, other African countries. \u201cPeople can discover you from anywhere, as long as you do honest work and you have a smartphone,\u201c Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nChibueze explains that PocketApp hopes to break through geographical limitations and connect sellers and buyers in different parts of the country. \u201cA strawberry trader in Lagos can buy strawberries from a vendor in Jos who has a pocket shop. That way, the price will be way cheaper because you\u2019re dealing with the vendor directly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Nigeria where e-commerce is nascent and people are more comfortable with buying goods physically, e-commerce companies have to build trust with their users. He explains that trust is one of PocketApp\u2019s major offerings. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve solved for commerce is trust. Anybody can sell anything online in the safest way possible. And anybody can sign in now with confidence. Because if you pay for an item, and you\u2019ve not gotten what you want, you\u2019ve got to deliver whatever it is, and always ask for your money back.\u201d\n\nCommenting on PocketApp\u2019s approval-in-principle, co-founder and COO of Piggytech Global, Odunayo Eweniyi, said in the aforementioned statement, \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly pleased that PocketApp has been granted an approval-in-principle as a Mobile Money Operator in Nigeria. We will now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the full operating license, enabling us to continue growing and expanding the scope of our social payments, social commerce and other digital financial products to reach millions of Nigerian micro-entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Electricity sector operators appear uncertain as July 1, 2022, the agreed date to activate new sets of contracts they have signed that commit them to deliver 5,000 megawatts of power to Nigerians, draws near.\n\nBusinessDay spoke with operators along the value chains on their state of preparedness to live up to their contract obligations, which place heavy sanctions including revocation of licences for reneging on them, and the responses were tepid.\n\n\u201cWe will wait and see,\u201d said Joy Ogaji, executive secretary of the Association of Power Generation Companies, a group that represents the interest of power generation companies (GenCos).\n\nThe distribution companies (DisCos) who spoke to BusinessDay also said they were waiting to see how things unfold. \u201cFor now, we are following what the commission has directed,\u201d said Abdullazeez Abdullahi, spokesperson of Kaduna Electric. \u201cWe are not sure how things unfold; so we will see.\u201d\n\nSanusi Garba, chairman of Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), in a press briefing in Lagos recently, said the absence of commercial contracts underpinning transactions within the sector had been a major challenge, adding that the commission had resolved the issue by compelling operators to sign contracts for services.\n\n\u201cWe are currently moving to ensure that we achieve stability now, and that is why the government is making investments to improve the grid so that 5,000MW will be our benchmark from July,\u201d Garba said.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 3,049.1MW as of 6am on Wednesday, according to the Nigerian Electricity System Operator. It put the grid generation installed capacity at 13,014.14MW; generation capacity at 7,652.6MW; and transmission wheeling capacity at 8,100MW.\n\nThe new contracts, according to the NERC chairman, obligate the DisCos to take the power sent to them or pay for it. This eliminates the issue of stranded power because, according to the terms, electricity wheeled to DisCos from July 1 would be contracted volumes.\n\nBy the terms of the contract, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), the Federal Government-owned participant, will be compelled to ensure that the grid remains stable enough to wheel the contracted volumes from generation plants to either hydro or gas-fired plants. If the grid is unable to wheel power generated, the TCN will pay for the power supplied.\n\nRead also: Okra Solar raises $3m to power 290,000 Nigerian homes\n\nThe GenCos were compelled to sign contracts with gas suppliers for the required gas volumes to maintain the projected power delivery. Eighty percent of Nigeria\u2019s power generation is from gas-fired power plants, and a lack of firm contracts has forced suppliers to prioritise other users.\n\nUnder the new terms, even the hydropower plants \u2013 Kainji and Jebba \u2013 have entered into the agreement committing to maintain water levels that will ensure a minimum supply of 2,000MW.\n\nThe commission, he said, was moving to ensure that all contracted gas volumes are fully paid for. The NERC chairman said the commission was going to enforce this contract by ensuring that erring market operators pay stiff penalties for failing to meet their obligation.\n\n\u201cWe have had discussions with all the participants and secured their commitments. All stakeholders have made a commitment and there will be consequences for failing to meet them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut beyond paying penalties, we are keen to resolve the issues in the power sector and that is why we are engaging all the players to ensure that the rules are followed.\u201d\n\nIn the first phase, NERC seeks to secure available generation capacity of at least 5,000MW starting from July 2022 while 6,000MW will be secured from January 2023.\n\nThe contract activation seeks to improve the capacity of the DisCos to migrate customers to higher service bands and attract commercial and industrial customers to provide a stable base-load.\n\nIt is aimed at creating certainty in the gas-power market segment through contracting as a way to improve firm gas availability to power stations and to move the electricity market to a full contracts market.\n\nExisting contracts\n\nThe existing contracts in the Nigerian energy supply industry sees the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), the manager and administrator of the electricity pool in the industry, buy energy and capacity from 26 generation plants owned by the respective GenCos that have contracts with NBET.\n\nSome GenCos have power purchase agreements; others have interim agreements executed pending formalisation on PPAs. The electricity purchased by NBET through PPAs are resold to DisCos through vesting contracts and transported on a physical network that forms the electricity value chain.\n\nOther contractual arrangements include gas supply agreement, gas transportation agreement, and grid connection agreement.",

          "title": "Nigerians abroad hoard dollar to hedge naira assets risk",
          "text": "Anthony Opara (not real name) is an information technology expert gainfully employed as a Nigerian-American in Texas for the past two decades.\n\nBefore now, to meet his financial obligations for his extended family members in Nigeria, he leveraged huge funds in his naira bank accounts and rental income from a few of his real estate assets in the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nRecently, Opara\u2019s view on keeping the naira as against the dollar changed. \u201cWhy will I exchange my, say, $10,000 to naira just to buy an asset again when I know that if I need money from the same investment to pay my bills, on conversion to dollar, I won\u2019t have equivalent of the $10,000 I had exchanged to naira?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI will rather keep my dollar here with me, whenever I have needs to spend naira in Nigeria, I will exchange it at the rate that is obtainable at that time, which may be even be higher; that is all,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his almost two decades in the United States, he had before now leveraged better returns from his investments in Nigeria to service mortgage abroad, but the declining value of naira makes him earn less from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInvestors would usually consider not just the cost or value of an investment, but also the real expected returns and the associated risks,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC.\n\nHe said while Nigerian assets may appear cheap when converted to major foreign currencies due to the devaluation of the naira, \u201cthere is risk and uncertainty regarding the stability of the naira which will impact the real return, foreign exchange regime and access to forex which will impact the ability to repatriate returns and capital on exit.\u201d\n\nRead also: Naira weakens to 615 as dollar scarcity lingers\n\nSince March 2020, foreign exchange (FX) illiquidity and the widening gulf between the official and parallel exchange rates have led to FX conversion and fund repatriation problems for foreign investors in the Nigerian equities market, a concern that made the MSCI Inc, a global provider of equity, fixed income and real estate indexes, to recently announce that it is considering removing Nigeria from its Frontier Markets Indexes (MSCI Frontier Markets and MSCI Frontier Markets 100 indexes).\n\nSeveral actions have been taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to increase its foreign earnings, improve liquidity across the FX windows and encourage the inflow of diaspora remittances.\n\nFor instance, the CBN had on November 30, 2020 directed all international money transfer operators to pay funds to beneficiaries of diaspora remittances in foreign currency (US dollars) as against naira payment in a bid to reduce the pressure on the FX parallel market.\n\nThe World Bank has said that Nigeria\u2019s diaspora inflow will witness an increase to $29 billion in 2022 as a result of the continued adoption of official bank channels for the facilitation of remittance inflow and higher food prices in the country. It said the flow of diaspora remittances to low and middle-income economies would rise by 4.2 percent to $630 billion this year.\n\nCurrently, many analysts allocate higher risks to holding naira assets due to high inflation, consistent depreciation of the local currency in the parallel market. There is also limited investment option to protect the purchasing power of naira as the fixed income market offers negative real returns despite rate hike in May.\n\n\u201cThe FX challenge in the country does not encourage diasporans to invest in Nigeria assets. Investors are unable to get their money out when they want either as dividends or as capital,\u201d said Akeem Oyewale, CEO of Marble Capital Limited, an assets management firm.\n\nOyewale said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the asset classes that entice them enough. The major reason is actually the assets flows; if there\u2019s proper access to flows where they can get in and get out as they like, then we will see a lot more investors\u2019 participation in our market.\n\n\u201cAnybody that is going to come in now must be willing to take both FX risk and the country\u2019s risk. So, when you are able to provide them additional returns, then they are able to participate. They don\u2019t feel encouraged to invest right now because if they need money for anything, it is being stuck for a while for the last two to three years. So, they are not so confident.\u201d\n\nBusola Jeje, a portfolio manager in a Lagos-based investment bank, described FX and repatriation of capital as major issues.\n\n\u201cForeign investors come in expecting naira to appreciate so as to get more dollars but naira doesn\u2019t appreciate, although there are attractive gains in the equity market but the currency movement can move against you and wipe out your entire capital,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, current yields from Nigeria assets are very low, and in addition to fixed income securities like Treasury bills, most foreign investors also like to invest in money market and other short-term investments. S\n\nShe noted that MSCI Inc wants to remove Nigeria from their frontier markets indexes, \u201cmaking our assets more unattractive to foreign investors\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy is not attractive to the foreign investors because even the macroeconomic indicators show that it is not doing well, also political instability drives away foreign investors,\u201d she added.\n\nAnother investment banking source who spoke to BusinessDay said: \u201cIt is the same reason that foreign investors are not bringing capital to Nigeria, and what are the issues: (i) we have a pricing problem, to be specific, the Nigerian exchange rate and the foreign exchange policy. I don\u2019t want to bring in $1,000 in the market when it will change for N420 and in the black market it is N615.\n\n\u201cBecause the moment I bring in my dollar, I\u2019m converting to naira first; so if I go through Nigerian stockbrokers and the like, I\u2019m most likely to lose, because it passes through the banking system. The general thing is you go through that route and you don\u2019t have a favourable policy and that\u2019s the challenge and it\u2019s one of the reasons foreign investors are not coming to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe source also cited the recent rise in inflation and devaluation risk. \u201cDevaluation is only favourable when I have not come into your market. It is not favourable when I\u2019m already in your market; so when foreign investors want you to devalue, they will be able to sell cheaper and they want clarity around it, but the moment you are in, you are ready to convert your naira to the dollar.\u201d\n\nAyodeji Ajilore, an investment research analyst at ARM Securities, said financial analysts\u2019 belief in a government could shape the thought of investors.\n\nRead also: I should have been a delegate (or dollargate)!\n\nHe said: \u201cIf they have confidence in a government, it reflects in their reports and can in turn shape the decision of both retail and high net worth investors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of confidence in the government, that they can project about the FX, that naira can devalue even more which can send panic into the system and people start hoarding the dollar. As at December, we had $20 billion in Nigeria domiciliary accounts and if these funds find their way into the system, it will provide enough liquidity to bring the naira up. But lack of trust is keeping people\u2019s money tied there.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also fear of exit; foreign investors are afraid that upon maturity of their investments such as Eurobond and money market securities, they can\u2019t get their money back in dollars as the CBN is not healthy FX-wise to meet this needs.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHealth is wealth. A healthy population is a productive population. This is the propelling stunt with which Edo State is delivering adequate, effective and effectual healthcare service to the people of the state.\n\nTo ensure that the ripples of the uncommon health care spread across Edo State, the state Ministry of Health is embarking on the enforcement of regulating and monitoring all healthcare facilities in the state to ensure they operate within the drag-net of ethnical and professional prerequisites and practice.\n\nIn a chat with Mr. Thompson Erhomonsele an editor with The NIGERIAN OBSERVER newspaper in Benin City, the Director, Directorate of Regulation and Monitoring in the Edo State Ministry of Health, Dr Stanley Ehiarimwian, opens up on the essence and operations of the regulation and monitoring enforcement team.\n\nThe Excerpts:-\n\nLet the people know you\n\nI am Dr Stanley Ehiariamwian, the Director, Directorate of Regulation and Monitoring in the Edo State Ministry of Health.\n\nWhat Is Your Office Doing In The Ministry For Edo State?\n\nWhat we do essentially in this office is to regulate and monitor public as well as private health care facilities in Edo state, if you go to a private or public facility, services are rendered by human beings comprising doctors, nurses and medical laboratory scientist, pharmacists and other staff that you find there. So in this directorate, what we do entails regulation and monitoring of the practices that occur, the kind of services that are rendered in health facilities in the state, those who render those services, if the personnel are qualified, if they are adequate in number, if they have the tools, if they have the equipments, if the environment is good enough for human beings to be treated, whatever it takes to ensure that the people of Edo get the best of care when they go to a health facility in the state that is what our job entails.\n\nWe are the ones who ensure that the best practices are met, standard of practice, minimum requirements are met and we are the ones who ensure that before you have a health facility whether a hospital, medical centre, clinic, pharmacy, laboratory centers, nursing homes and maternities, we are the ones who give approval for you to set up that place. By giving approval, it means that minimum standard could have been met.\n\nThe State Governor, Governor Godwin Obaseki has been very wonderful. He has given us the backing we need to ensure that Edo people are healthy and safe. We want to also key into the vision of the Executive Governor to ensure that Edo people are healthy and wealthy because it\u2019s only those who are alive that can strive to become wealthy and become one thing or the other in life. That is essentially what we do here.\n\nIn doing our job, of course, there are a lot of impediments, there are issue and regulation. There are a lot of obstacles you meet when you go out to ensure that the right things are done to ensure that the people of Edo get the best of care. It\u2019s not just enough to have hospitals or medical health facilities scattered all over the place. We want a situation in which, irrespective of the facility you go to, you can beat your chest and say \u201coh! If I go to so and so place I will get the best of care,\u201d because life has no duplicate.\n\nWe do not want our people to get into the hands of those who are not qualified. We do not want our people to get into the hands of those who are just interested in the money they will make. Yes, there are gasps in the system. We may not have all the facilities in all the localities in Edo state but there are those facilities that have been approved. We want to ensure that everything is in place for people to get the best of care. We know that there are also places that may be functioning or that have been operating under questionable circumstances to the extent that whoever dies may not have been duly or properly registered. From time to time, we will go out to ensure that such places are fished out and that sanctions are meted out to them. But we also work in an environment where people just like to cut corners, people want to operate in a space that they do not have the qualification and even those who have required qualifications, there are some limits to which they can practice and from time to time we try to go out and do some monitoring exercises to ensure that some of the lapses are addressed.\n\nIt has not been easy. It\u2019s been tough because quite a number of our people do not understand that in regulating and monitoring what goes on in health facilities, whether public or private, we are actually working for everybody, even as someone who works for this office, sometimes you too may get sick that you may not be able to decide or determine which health facility you are going to get taken to but if the health industry is well-regulated, when you get to decide where to take you to but someone who is close to you may be close to a health practitioner but may not be able to get across. So anywhere you are taken to, you are sure that you are going to get some form of quality care.\n\nA lot of unwholesome practices are going on, people are doing what they are not supposed to do and we are also trying to reverse some of the laws in the states that regulate the practice of health issues in Edo state. Some of the laws are old. So we are working on those laws. We are trying to revisit and revise them. All stakeholders are on board. Very soon, we will re-convey that committee. It was on before but due to COVID-19 we went down for a while but the State Head of Service is the one chairing that committee and hopefully by the special grace of God we are going to start soon and ensure that whatever policy that we will put in place to ensure that those who are practicing illegally, those who are practicing wrongly, those who do not have the prerequisite, competence or experience to practice in Edo State will be checked. We want to ensure that we run them out of town, run them out of business and that the long arm of the law will catch up with them. There are fines for such offences.\n\nThey can face imprisonment depending on the level of such offence. When you go out, even outside the health facilities, you\u2019ll see all kinds of wares (concoctions), you will see women especially, and they have trades of all kinds of business on their head, they have all kinds of mixture, sometimes they tell you it is washing and setting. The life expectancy in Nigeria is around 50 years or thereabout and that is very low. There are quite a number of things responsible for why our people do not live as long as they are supposed to live and even those who are alive are battling with one form of ailment or the other. So because of that a lot has been happening and now the state, more than ever before, has come all out to give out the necessary support for the backing to ensure that the people of Edo state are healthy, they are able to perform optimally, they are able to beat their chest to say even if we are in a country where people think that we have gaps but we want to set the pace to ensure that the space is properly and adequately regulated and our people, at the end of the day, will be better for it.\n\nWhat are the specific requirements for health facilities?\n\nThere is usually a list of minimum requirement depending on the kind of facility. For example, for a hospital, you will expect that they have more rooms, more space, and more personnel working in the hospital, more services cutting across a lot compared to, maybe, a clinic. Ordinarily, like a lot of people may not know, most clinics are supposed to run on an out-patient basis, they see patient, they just monitor and observe but they don\u2019t do admission. So if you are looking at a hospital for example, you are looking at personnel who should be more in number when compared to a clinic as the case may be. We are looking at equipment you should have to run a place like that, they are looking at the size of that facility to be able to accommodate as many beds as possible, we are looking at more skilled manpower. Whereas in a small medical centre or clinic, you might be good to go with a pharmacy technician dispensing drugs but in a big hospital you expect to find that a pharmacist should actually be in place to ensure that things are done properly. For the laboratory, or big diagnostic centers you are expected to find medical lab scientist as against some very small places where we may have a laboratory technician, such places can actually work.\n\nThere is a list of requirements and beyond that there are also other requirements. Your personnel have to be qualified; they have to have all the certifications needed for them to practice, the school they went to, youth service certification as the case may be, then proper license from the regulatory councils depending on which profession. You need to get your tax clearance for at least three years, the building plan of the place and other requirements needed to ensure that everything is put in place to give the people the best of care.\n\nIt is also important to know that for public hospitals owned by the government, they may not have some of the deficits like you have in the private hospitals. As part of regulations to those health care workers in public hospitals they are paid by the government they are staff at government. Yes, we know that some of them have private facilities that they run. If you are old enough in the system yes, the system allow you to run your own private facility if you have the years of experience but on no account should a doctor, nurse or any other health staff employed by government use the time of Edo state government to run his or her private facility. That will be seriously frowned at and if we find something like that happening, that health facility is going to pay dearly for it. When you have government time, use government time for its business. When you close from work, you can go to your facility. So, we are interested in what goes on.\n\nWe do not want to have hospitals owned by government, manpower paid by government and the people are nowhere to be found when patients come for treatment and you know that in health centre, not getting the treatment at the time you are supposed to get it is a bad thing. One minute is a long time in medicine.\n\nSo when patients come to the hospital and they have to wait endlessly before doctors, nurses or whoever is supposed to attend to them comes, it is a big problem and we are saying no to that. Whoever is found culpable will face the wrath of law. There will be no room for complacency, people should be at their duty post, it is not enough to point fingers and everybody should do what he or she is paid to do.\n\nWhat are you planning to do in other to check quackery in healthcare practice?\n\nYou know when we are talking about quackery, quackery has to do with not being qualified to do a job and also not having the experience to do those jobs beyond all qualification. Now, there are regulatory bodies for example, for doctors there is a medical and dental council of Nigeria who issues licenses to doctors to be able to practice within the country called Nigeria where we live and so when our facilities are about to be opened, you have to register before we give approval, we usually ask for the requirements and as part of the requirement, we look at their certifications to know how qualified they are, and of course inside my office here, you will see that there is a master register so if I want to have a list of all the doctors at a particular year, it is just easy for me to get it.\n\nWhat is your advice to stakeholders in the healthcare industry?\n\nAll the stakeholders (care-givers) should endeavour to do the right thing to meet standard in order to ensure an effective and efficient service delivery. This is because the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki is committed to having a healthy, productive and wealthy populace in Edo State.\n\nIt is being worthwhile having this chat with you\n\nYou are welcome.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Christopher Odia, in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area of the State.\n\nShaibu, who led other government functionaries and heads of security agencies in the state, on Monday, to Ikabigbo, called for calm among residents in the community.\n\nThe acting governor also commiserated with the Head of Ikabigbo Community, Aleghe Braimah; family of a member of the Edo Vigilante Network who lost his life in an attempt to rescue the priest, Yusuf Nurudeen, and the Ogieneni of Uzairue, Kadiri Omogbai.\n\nShaibu said he was in the area to commiserate with the Uzairue people and get first-hand knowledge of the incident, noting, \u201cThe unfortunate attack resulted in the killing of Rev.

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

In addition, the group will visit universities and high schools, meet Nigerian students, and explore their historical ties to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe 1972 visit to Nigeria infused African music into the Glee Club\u2019s tradition and American Choral music in general. Fifty years later, choirs across the United States sing in Nigerian languages, highlighting the long-term impact of that exchange.\n\n\u201cThe Morehouse College Glee Club has since learned a variety of songs in Edo, Yor\u00f9b\u00e1, Hausa, and Igbo, including a piece specifically composed for them by Igwe Laz Ekwueme, famed Nollywood actor and University of Lagos professor.\n\n\u201cDuring the visit, the Morehouse College Glee Club will carry out a dynamic exchange of musical knowledge with the broad spectrum of the Nigerian society, singing in Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba languages,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Ambassador, Mary-Beth Leonard, in her own remarks, explained that the visit will strengthen the longstanding ties between American and Nigerian institutions of higher learning, and further expand the scope of academic and cultural relations between the United States and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cCultural exchanges such as the visit of the Morehouse College Glee Club will help contribute to strengthening the bonds of friendship and collaboration through music and arts, offering an opportunity for Nigerian students to learn about academic experiences in the United States,\u201d she stated\n\nMany of the student members of the Morehouse College Glee Club described their visit as an opportunity to connect with their African roots.\n\nSchneider Grandpierre, 19, said, \u201cI love the culture of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nA junior third-year student studying Music and Computer Science at the Morehouse College said of the trip, she continued, \u201cIt is such an enriching and amazing experience to be able to reconnect with our cultural roots and sing Nigerian music in different languages. I look forward to an extended stay here even after this tour.\u201d\n\nExpressing his excitement about the visit, 23-year-old John Batey, a Business Administration major and tenor singer for the choral group said he has been able to trace his roots to Nigeria through a DNA test. \u201cWe will be exploring the Nigerian creative and entertainment industry. I am excited about the tour.\u201d\n\nDirector of the Morehouse College Glee Club, Professor David Morrow, explained that the choral group will perform a repertoire of African and American songs particularly African-American spirituals which have roots in West African music traditions.\n\nProfessor Morrow noted that the Morehouse College Glee Club is rooted in Dr Martin Luther King, Jr\u2019s legacy. Dr King who sang in the Morehouse College Glee Club was one of the notable alumni of the Historically Black College in the United States.\n\nSome of the Igbo names given to the Igbo-Americans include Ezuomike, Ogalanya, Odenigwe, Anyim, Ifeanyi, among others.\n\nAmong those who witnessed the ceremony was the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, who also represented the leadership of the apex Igbo socio-cultural at the ceremony.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday night in Lisbon, Portugal gave assurances of a free hand to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), reiterating the commitment of his administration to ensure that the Commission (INEC) delivers peaceful transparent, free, fair and credible elections next year.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with representatives of Nigerians living in Portugal, the President said with the conclusion of the primaries of the political parties, all eyes are now on the 2023 elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018We also look forward to a smooth transition to the next government. As I have said before, our Administration will not compromise on doing the right things and the welfare of Nigerians, home and abroad,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nCiting the last gubernatorial elections in Anambra & Ekiti State, the President noted that this administration has proven consistently its zero tolerance for interference in elections & insistence that Nigerians should be allowed to vote for the party & candidate of their choice.\n\nA statement from Garba Shehu, his senior special assistant on media and publicity, said the president also used the occasion to caution against the use of social media to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance, urging the Diaspora to always promote Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u2018\u2018The world is a global village and technology has shrunk the world even more. Although you reside beyond Nigeria\u2019s boundaries you can engage easily with the country. In fact, we see the impact of that engagement clearly on social media.\n\n\u2018\u2018This platform has empowered Nigerians in the diaspora and given you great influence. As we have seen, however, social media can be a force for good as well as a force for evil.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many countries, including our own have had to take strong measures against some social media platforms to curb their excesses and prevent them from destabilizing our societies.\n\n\u2018\u2018I, therefore, call upon you to use social media responsibly. We all want the best for our country and people, so let us strive to build, unite and prosper our nation and people and not to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight in the successful involvement of Diaspora in various fields such as agriculture, health care, education, ICT, and the food industry in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that many countries, including Nigeria, have shown that their diaspora can be a veritable engine for growth and development.\n\nAcknowledging the huge contribution the Diaspora have made to Nigeria\u2019s economy, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018In every field of human endeavour, be it the creative industries, sports, health, academia, Nigerians in the diaspora have thrived and leveraged on their skills to raise our country\u2019s profile higher, economically, socially, technologically and culturally.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is for these reasons that this Government established the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to facilitate and support your engagement with our country for a win-win outcome in our effort to keep Nigerians united at home and abroad.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must continue to be our ambassadors-at-large in your comportment, actions and character. You must excel and be the best in all your endeavours. While here, you must also not forget home as you are the example we want to project to the rest of the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader assured the meeting coordinated by Chairman NIDCOM, Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa that the Federal Government would continue to do everything possible to catalyse development in various fields of the economy.\n\nHe also encouraged them to key into the programmes of NiDCOM, so as to contribute to initiatives such as the Nigerian Diaspora Investment Trust Fund.\n\nNigerian Ambassador to Portugal, Alex Enan Kefas, told President Buhari that records indicate that there are some 3,000 Nigerians living in the country, who are generally well behaved and living peacefully among themselves and the host authorities.\n\nThe Ambassador informed the President of the recent arrest and detention of about thirteen Nigerians for alleged offences of money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nHe explained that the Embassy conducted a consular visit to the prison which revealed that the arrests were \u2018\u2018disproportionate and unjust\u2019\u2019 as many of them were innocent of the allegations.\n\nHe said the Mission is trying its best to ensure the release of the innocent to enable them to reunite with their families.\n\nAt the meeting with the Diaspora, a Nigerian professional footballer, Saviour Godwin, who plays for Portuguese side Casa Pia, presented a jersey to President Buhari.",

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said the party remains united and that he is making efforts to reach to aggrieved members.\n\nThe former vice president who took to his twitter account on Thursday to speak amid escalating crisis over his unilateral decision to pick Ifeanyi Okowa, Delta State governor as his running mate, noted that he respects all the governors and other stakeholders of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe @OfficialPDPNig will remain united. Focus on our actions. We are taking action to address the feelings of all party members. The unity in our community is my priority. Our resolve to unify Nigeria starts in our party and moves to the community, then on to society.\n\n\u201cEvery Governor, Legislator, and other elected officials produced by our party, and party members and loyalists, are much loved and respected by me.\n\n\u201cWhen they speak, I listen. I do not only listen. Appropriate actions have been taken, are being taken, and will continue to be advanced.\u201d\n\nCrisis is currently brewing in the PDP over the ex-vice president\u2019s choice of running mate, with many of the party\u2019s governors said to have decided not to back his presidential ambition.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV on Wednesday, Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue State, narrated how the governors recommended Nyesom Wike as Atiku\u2019s running mate only for him to discard the recommendation without consulting them.\n\nSimilarly, Ayodele Fayose, former governor of Ekiti State on Wednesday, noted that Wike will not back the former vice president, even as he declared that he would back power shift to south in 2023.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, Fayose announced that power should return to the South in 2023, as according to him, President Muhammadu Buhari would be completing eight years in 2023, and therefore, it\u2019s only logical for power to return to the South.\n\nFurther emphasising on the point he made in the tweet, the former Ekiti governor who received Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, the state\u2019s governor-elect in his Lagos residence on Wednesday, told Premium Times that Wike would never support the Atiku candidacy, and that they would help rock the PDP boat going into 2023.\n\nHe recounted how Atiku \u201cpromised\u201d to make Mr Wike, the Rivers State governor, his running mate after he was declared winner of the PDP presidential primary election.\n\nAccording to him, Atiku failed to fulfil his promise to Mr Wike when he settled for the Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate.\n\n\u201cWike never said he wanted to be VP, but when Atiku visited him, he was the one who said, \u2018I want you to be my VP\u2019. He said that to Wike. If that then changes, is Wike not supposed to be told? Is he not supposed to know?\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Atiku had ignored the recommendation of a committee set up by the opposition party to pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cPDP set up a committee to recommend a running mate for the candidate and the committee voted and picked Wike, but they didn\u2019t comply with the recommendation of the committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the party is now a one-man show, we will show them that we can resist it. We are with Wike 100 per cent.\n\n\u201cWhen they need Wike\u2019s money and Wike\u2019s support, they will say, \u2018Wike is good enough\u2019. Wike has been injured, but we will remain with him. Whatever he does is what we would do; wherever he asks us to go is where we will go.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what would happen should Mr Wike ask them to support Mr Atiku, the former governor said: \u201cWike will never say we should support Atiku.\n\n\u201cWike cannot come out to say he is supporting Atiku. I dare him to say so; because he knows that whatever he says will haunt him forever. If Wike supports Atiku, we will abandon him.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday night in Lisbon, Portugal gave assurances of a free hand to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, reiterating the commitment of his administration to ensure that the Commission (INEC) delivers peaceful, transparent, free, fair and credible elections next year.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with representatives of Nigerians living in Portugal, the President said with the conclusion of the primaries of the political parties, all eyes are now on the 2023 elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018We also look forward to a smooth transition to the next government. As I have said before, our Administration will not compromise on doing the right things and the welfare of Nigerians, home and abroad,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nCiting the last gubernatorial elections in Anambra and Ekiti State, the President noted that this administration has proven consistently its zero tolerance for interference in elections and insistence that Nigerians should be allowed to vote for the party and candidate of their choice.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to caution against the use of social media to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance, urging the Diaspora to always promote Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u2018\u2018The world is a global village and technology has shrunk the world even more. Although you reside beyond Nigeria\u2019s boundaries you can engage easily with the country. In fact, we see the impact of that engagement clearly on social media.\n\n\u2018\u2018This platform has empowered Nigerians in the diaspora and given you great influence. As we have seen, however, social media can be a force for good as well as a force for evil.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many countries, including our own have had to take strong measures against some social media platforms to curb their excesses and prevent them from destabilizing our societies.\n\n\u2018\u2018I, therefore, call upon you to use social media responsibly. We all want the best for our country and people, so let us strive to build, unite and prosper our nation and people and not to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight in the successful involvement of Diaspora in various fields such as agriculture, health care, education, ICT, and the food industry in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that many countries, including Nigeria, have shown that their diaspora can be a veritable engine for growth and development.\n\nAcknowledging the huge contribution the Diaspora have made to Nigeria\u2019s economy, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018In every field of human endeavour, be it the creative industries, sports, health, academia, Nigerians in the diaspora have thrived and leveraged on their skills to raise our country\u2019s profile higher, economically, socially, technologically and culturally.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is for these reasons that this Government established the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to facilitate and support your engagement with our country for a win-win outcome in our effort to keep Nigerians united at home and abroad.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must continue to be our ambassadors-at-large in your comportment, actions and character.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must excel and be the best in all your endeavours. While here, you must also not forget home as you are the example we want to project to the rest of the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader assured the meeting coordinated by Chairman NIDCOM, Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa that the Federal Government would continue to do everything possible to catalyse development in various fields of the economy.\n\nHe also encouraged them to key into the programmes of NiDCOM, so as to contribute to initiatives such as the Nigerian Diaspora Investment Trust Fund.\n\nNigerian Ambassador to Portugal, Alex Enan Kefas, told President Buhari that records indicate that there are some 3,000 Nigerians living in the country, who are generally well behaved and living peacefully among themselves and the host authorities.\n\nThe Ambassador informed the President of the recent arrest and detention of about thirteen Nigerians for alleged offences of money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nHe explained that the Embassy conducted a consular visit to the prison which revealed that the arrests were \u2018\u2018disproportionate and unjust\u2019\u2019 as many of them were innocent of the allegations.\n\nHe said the Mission is trying its best to ensure the release of the innocent to enable them to reunite with their families.\n\nAt the meeting with the Diaspora, a Nigerian professional footballer, Saviour Godwin, who plays for Portuguese side Casa Pia, presented a jersey to President Buhari.",

          "text": "Former governor of Ekiti State Ayo Fayose has outlined why he thinks Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, will never back Atiku Abubakar, the PDP candidate for president (PDP).\n\nAccording to Premium Times, Mr. Ayo Fayose declared that after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second term expires in 2023, leadership must be transferred to the southern region of Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, the former governor recalled how Mr. Atiku \u201cpromised\u201d to name Mr. Wike, the governor of Rivers State, as his running mate once he was named the winner of the PDP presidential primary contest.\n\nAccording to the former Ekiti governor, Mr. Atiku failed to fulfill his promise to Mr. Wike when he settled for the Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate.\n\n\u201cWike never said he wanted to be VP, but when Atiku visited him, he was the one who said, \u2018I want you to be my VP\u2019. He said that to Wike. If that then changes, is Wike not supposed to be told? Is he not supposed to know?\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Mr. Atiku had ignored the recommendation of a committee set up by the opposition party to pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cPDP set up a committee to recommend a running mate for the candidate and the committee voted and picked Wike, but they didn\u2019t comply with the recommendation of the committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the party is now a one-man show, we will show them that we can resist it. We are with Wike 100 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen they need Wike\u2019s money and Wike\u2019s support, they will say, \u2018Wike is good enough. Wike has been injured, but we will remain with him. Whatever he does is what we would do; wherever he asks us to go is where we will go.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what would happen should Mr. Wike ask them to support Mr. Atiku, the former governor said: \u201cWike will never say we should support Atiku.\n\n\u201cWike cannot come out to say he is supporting Atiku. I dare him to say so; because he knows that whatever he says will haunt him forever. If Wike supports Atiku, we will abandon him.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s response\n\nContacted for a response, Paul Ibe, Mr. Atiku\u2019s spokesperson, said his principal and the party will continue to appeal to aggrieved persons within their fold to embrace dialogue.\n\n\u201cBecause the bigger challenge is winning the election, kicking out the APC, and stopping them from the many years of impoverishing our people,\u201d said Mr. Ibe.\n\n\u201cIt is normal for our people to be aggrieved but the PDP has a way of resolving issues like this and that will be done and we all shall be happy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Power to the south\u2019\n\nOn whether the plan is now to technically support the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, or his counterpart in the Labour Party, Peter Obi, Mr. Fayose said: \u201cThis is not about Bola Tinubu or Obi, but this is about our belief that power must come to the south and it is a struggle we must actualize.\n\nMr. Fayose further explained that \u201cwhen the June 12 election was canceled, the presidency was zoned to the southwest to pacify the southwest region.\n\n\u201cWhen former President Goodluck Jonathan was over staying, it was believed that he was already using the northern slot. So, he was opposed and a northern candidate was installed through the APC.\n\n\u201cThis time, it is the turn of the south because Buhari has spent eight years. Why will PDP be insisting that it must again be the turn of the north.\u201d\n\nMr. Fayose also stated that he does not care if his actions are perceived as anti-party activity.\n\n\u201c What I am saying is, it is the turn of the South, and if they want to expel me, to hell with them. I am not taking money from anyone to belong to this party.\n\n\u201cIf they want to rock this boat, we will help them to rock it.\u201d",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress has set up a task force to commence immediate registration of students and revalidation of its members across the country.\n\nThe inauguration of the task force, which took place on Wednesday at the party headquarters in Abuja, was believed to be a response to the cult following of the former Anambra State governor and Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on social media.\n\nObi had dumped the Peoples Democratic Party for Labour Party to keep the dream of his presidential ambition alive.\n\nHis growing profile and frugal lifestyle have ignited calls among his youthful supporters who have taken over the social media space with calls for a peaceful revolution through mass registration for permanent voters\u2019 cards, jingles, and door-to-door campaigns ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nWorried by the trend, the National Youth Leader of APC, Dayo Israel, on Wednesday announced the formation of a task force to immediately commence the registration and revalidation of students and youths in the country.\n\nThe task force has former Kwara State Commissioner for information, Ben Duntoye; APC Deputy National Youth Leader, Jamaldeen Kabir, and Director of National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim as co-chairmen.\n\nOthers include former Member of the APC Board of Trustees, Rinsola Abiola; Commissioner of Federal Character Commission, Ginika Tor; Chief of Staff to the Minister of State, Mines and Steel, Kelechi Ekugo; Ogban Ogban, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Ben Ayade; Aminu Uba, Special Assistant to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu; Irinoye Omolayo, Senior Legislative Aide to Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege; North Central Zonal Youth Leader, Zubair Aliyu; North East Zonal Youth Leader, Jason Baba Kwaghe; North West Zonal Youth Leader, Abdulhamid Umar Mohd; South South Zonal Youth Leader, Ebimobowei Oyas; South East Zonal Youth Leader, Ikenna Anyalewechi and South West Zonal Youth Leader, Lawal Kolade Paff among others.\n\nIsrael disclosed that the task force has been mandated to coordinate the registration and revalidation exercise of students and youths-led support groups into a recognisable structure.\n\n\u201cThe structure will be strongly aligned with the objectives and strategic imperatives of the National Working Committee under the distinguished leadership of Senator Adamu Abdullahi.\n\n\u201cI have assembled these respected voices and party loyalists as members of APC Youth Wing National Special Task Force on Revalidation and Registration of APC youths and focused support groups.\n\n\u201cThe revalidation of the affiliated youths and student support groups will be opened for a period of one month starting from Friday 1 to July 31. This move would also enable effective coordination, disciplined harmonization of activities in alignment with the party\u2019s goals, aid provision and accountability, as well as efficient management and enhanced operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC national youth leader disclosed that as part of their task, the newly inaugurated team will collect phone numbers and email address lists of registered members and groups after validation of their PVCs, party membership cards and attestation from two guarantors.\n\nWhen asked by our correspondent to confirm if the recent move is to neutralise the threat of the \u2018Obidient\u2019 movement on social media, Israel said that he didn\u2019t really consider Obi\u2019s growing supporters as a serious threat.\n\n\u201cA lion is not threatened by the noise of the rat in his backyard. You must understand that as a party, we have continued to play our part as youths. The APC youth wing will always rise when the occasion demands because we are passionate about change.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not threatened, we are not sitting on our oars. We are taking responsibility because we have the structure. The future of this party belongs to us. Our own response as APC generals is to wake up all our battalions and garrison commanders in our party support groups across the nation and bring them together.\n\n\u201cWe want to document all our support groups and create programmes, activities and empower them with skills acquisition.

          "text": "Ahead of the Osun State Governorship Election scheduled for July 16 and the 2023 general elections coming up in eight months\u2019 time, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is enmeshed in fresh crisis over the choice of Delta state Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nGovernor Okowa was announced Atiku\u2019s running mate June 16.\n\nThe announcement came 24 hours after the Advisory Committee tasked with the responsibility of coming up with Atiku\u2019s running mate voted in favour of Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nConsequently, many of the party stakeholders, especially governors sympathetic to Wike\u2019s plight, were shunning the party\u2019s affairs.\n\nIt is also on record that the PDP announced the names of the Ekiti State Governorship Campaign Council, but failed to inaugurate and didn\u2019t campaign in the state.\n\nThus, they lost and came distant 3rd.\n\nOn Wednesday, 11 out of the 13 governors elected on the PDP platform shunned the inauguration of the Osun state\u2019s 128- member National Campaign Council.\n\nPDP had, Monday, announced all the governors as members of the campaign council.\n\nHowever, at the inauguration Wednesday, only the governor of Delta state, and Taraba state Governor Darius Ishaku attended the ceremony in Abuja.\n\nMore shocking was the absence of the only PDP governor in South West, Seyi Makinde of Oyo state and chairman of the campaign council, Bayelsa state Governor Douye Diri stayed away without any explanation.\n\nOther governors absent include: Governor Wike, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto state, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of , Enugu, Samuel Ortom of Benue, Godwin Obaseki of Edo, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa, and Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the governors\u2019 attitude towards the party was not unconnected with their misgivings about how and who Atiku picked as running mate.\n\nI\u2019 m in hibernation mood \u2013 Ortom\n\nConfirming that all is not well with the PDP, Governor Ortom disclosed that he\u2019s in hibernation because Atiku\u2019s action fell short of their expectations.\n\nOrtom who appeared on Arise TV Wednesday explained that \u201cI was among the 17-member committee set up by Atiku, and 14 of us in the committee said the person should be Wike.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Atiku picked Okowa that is his wisdom. You cannot ignore decision of a committee you set up yourself and expect people to be happy. For now, I have gone into hibernation.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would support the candidature of PDP, Ortom didn\u2019t give direct answer but said, \u201cI am in hibernation. I am praying. When I finished the prayers and whatever God directs me, I will do.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cWe expect Atiku to do more but we are not seeing that.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that Wike was ignoring Atiku\u2019s calls and emissary, the Benue state governor said, \u201cthey should stop that. Atiku should go to him. Why won\u2019t he ignore their calls. Is that not an insult? Wike is a pillar in the party. Currently, nobody in the party has contributed more for the party to move forward than Wike.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku was not going to honour the decision of the committee, he should have called Wike earlier and informed him. He didn\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do things anyhow and expect us to be happy.\u201d\n\nWith commitment, we\u2018ll deliver \u2013 Okowa\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of the Osun National Campaign Council, Okowa stressed that only with commitment PDP would win Osun governorship and the 2023 elections.\n\nThe governor who claimed they won the 2018 Osun State Governorship election, alleged they were cheated out by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government.\n\n\u201cAs we move into another election, we are confident that if all of us, all of us stay committed to the party, that we will be able to deliver the victory for our party,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cOsun state obviously is a PDP states. We have great leaders who have a very clear understanding of the politics in that state.\u201d\n\nOkowa urged all party leaders and followers in the state to quickly bridge the gaps of divide to give room for victory.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done. It is not a fun fare, and I believe that the membership of the campaign council inaugurated today is capable enough to truly go out there to deliver the state to the PDP.\n\n\u201cFrom the information that we have, the APC is already in disarray in the state but that is not enough for us to go to sleep.\n\n\u201cI believe nobody wants Nigeria to continue the way it is today. The very, very difficult times that we are in has been brought to us by the bad governance of the APC government.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are able to redeem Nigeria, rescue it and begin a process of rebuilding this nation.

Others think the man has failed.\n\n\u201cThe southern governors, who are the majority in the PDP governors\u2019 forum are also unhappy with Ayu. So they want him out and replaced by a Southerner\u201d.\n\nReacting to this and the refuting his alleged suspension over misappropriation, Ayu described the report as mischievous, saying he took a well-deserved, two-week leave on 21st June, 2022.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday by his Special Adviser on Communication, Simon Imobo- Tswam, Ayu said he would be back next week to resume duties, specifically on July 6, 2022.\n\nHe said, as a stickler for due process, he formally handed over to the deputy national chairman (North), Amb. Damagun.\n\nThe statement partly read: \u201cIt was in that acting capacity that he (Damagun) today presided over the inauguration of the Osun State Gubernatorial Campaign Council, headed by the Executive Governor of Bayelsa State, H.E. Douye Diri.\n\n\u201cIf not that the authors of the mischievous and baseless Facebook posts were out to serve nefarious interests, they would have heard when the acting national chairman, Amb. Damagun, said during the ceremony today: \u201cOn behalf of my able National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, I hereby inaugurate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe general public is, therefore, advised to ignore the mischievous social media publications as they are purely the work of mischief makers and idle minds\u201d.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc. has called on Civil Servants to be dedicated to duty for improved productivity.\n\nAdegbite made the call during the celebration organized by the ministry to commemorate the 2022 African Public Service Day in Abuja.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction working with staff of the ministry due to their commitment to duty which he stressed should be sustained to take the ministry to enviable heights.\n\nDelivering her speech at the ceremony, Permanent Secretary, of the Ministry, Dr Oluwatoyin Akinlade, revealed that efforts were on to ensure that the ministry blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation.\n\nAkinlade who hailed the passion of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, HCSF, Folashade Mejabi Yemi-Esan, for improved productivity and welfare of civil servants, said the theme of the day, \u201cPerformance Management System, PMS: Impact on productivity in the Nigeria Public Sector\u201d was most apt as it summarises the vision of the HCSF to make the service a world class system that drives optimum productivity through effective and efficient performance management.\n\n\u201cShe has vigorously pursued the full implementation of the new Performance Management System through training of various categories of officers. This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "A ceremony is being held in the Democratic Republic of Congo to bury the gold-crowned tooth of independence hero Patrice Lumumba more than 60 years after he was assassinated.\n\nIt is the only part of his body that exists after his remains were dissolved in acid.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Belgian policeman who oversaw the disposal took the tooth as a trophy.\n\nIt was returned to the family last week and has toured several parts of DR Congo in a coffin.\n\nPeople have been able to pay their respects ahead of the funeral that is taking place in the capital, Kinshasa.\n\nPresident F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, Lumumba\u2019s family and other dignitaries are at the service which is taking place before the coffin is transferred to a specially built mausoleum.\n\nLumumba was the country\u2019s first prime minister and one of the leaders of the struggle for independence. He was also seen as one of the most prominent voices in Africa\u2019s anti-colonial movement.\n\nThursday marks 62 years since the former colonial power Belgium relinquished control of the vast country.\n\nBut it viewed Lumumba as a barrier to its efforts to maintain influence as well as hold on to important economic interests.\n\nIn a famous speech on independence day in 1960, in front of Belgian dignitaries including King Baudouin, Lumumba castigated Belgium saying that the Congolese had been held in \u201chumiliating slavery\u201d.\n\nThe Belgians were stunned as a black African had never dared speak like this in front of Europeans.\n\nLumumba was toppled as prime minister just over two months later. Then in January 1961, with the tacit backing of Belgium, he was shot by a firing squad, along with two allies.\n\nA Belgian policeman, Gerard Soete, was given the job of getting rid of the evidence. It was during that process that he pocketed the tooth and took it back with him to Belgium.\n\nIt was decades later that he revealed that he still had the tooth and only two years ago that Belgium agreed that it should be returned to the family.\n\nThe Covid pandemic delayed the process but last week it was handed over in Brussels.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Ketanji Brown Jackson is set to be sworn in on Thursday as a U.S. Supreme Court justice, making history as the first Black woman on the nation\u2019s top judicial body while joining it at a time when its conservative majority has been flexing its muscles in major rulings.\n\nJackson, 51, will become part of the liberal bloc of a court with a 6-3 conservative majority. Her swearing in as President Joe Biden\u2019s replacement for retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer comes six days after the court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark that legalized abortion nationwide. Breyer, at 83 the court\u2019s oldest member, officially retires at noon (1600 GMT), when Jackson\u2019s swearing-in ceremony is scheduled.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found that a majority of Americans \u2013 57% \u2013 holds a negative view of the court following the abortion ruling, a significant shift from earlier in the month when a narrow majority held a positive view.\n\nJackson will become the 116th justice, sixth woman and third Black person to serve on the Supreme Court since its 1789 founding.\n\nBiden appointed Jackson last year to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after she spent eight years as a federal district judge. Like the three conservative justices appointed by the Democratic president\u2019s Republican predecessor Donald Trump, Jackson is young enough to serve for decades in the lifetime job.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Jackson on a 53-47 vote on April 7, with three Republicans joining the Democrats in support of her. Jackson\u2019s appointment will not shift the court\u2019s ideological balance.\n\n\u201cIt has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d Jackson said at an April 8 event celebrating her confirmation. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made it \u2013 we\u2019ve made it \u2013 all of us, all of us.\u201d\n\nBiden has aimed to bring more women and minorities and a wider range of backgrounds to the federal judiciary. Jackson\u2019s appointment fulfilled a pledge Biden made during the 2020 presidential campaign to name a Black woman to the Supreme Court. With Jackson\u2019s addition, the Supreme Court for the first time also will have four women on the bench.\n\nBreyer in January announced his plans to retire, having served since being appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1994. Jackson served as a clerk for Breyer early in her legal career.\n\nThe court is set to issue its final two rulings of its current term on Thursday. Jackson will be joining a liberal bloc that has found itself outvoted in major rulings this term, not only on abortion rights but on gun rights, expanding religious liberties and other matters.\n\nJackson will participate in arguments in cases for the first time when the court\u2019s next term opens in October. One major case for the coming term gives the conservative justices an opportunity to end affirmative action policies used by colleges and universities in their admissions processes to increase their enrollment of Black and Hispanic students to achieve campus diversity.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday night in Lisbon, Portugal gave assurances of a free hand to the Independent National Electoral Commission, reiterating the commitment of his administration to ensure that the Commission delivers peaceful, transparent, free, fair and credible elections next year.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with representatives of Nigerians living in Portugal, the President said with the conclusion of the primaries of the political parties, all eyes are now on the 2023 elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018We also look forward to a smooth transition to the next government. As I have said before, our administration will not compromise on doing the right things and the welfare of Nigerians, home and abroad,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nCiting the last gubernatorial elections in Anambra and Ekiti State, the President noted that this administration has proven consistently its zero tolerance for interference in elections and insistence that Nigerians should be allowed to vote for the party and candidate of their choice.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to caution against the use of social media to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance, urging the Diaspora to always promote Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u2018\u2018The world is a global village and technology has shrunk the world even more. Although you reside beyond Nigeria\u2019s boundaries you can engage easily with the country. In fact, we see the impact of that engagement clearly on social media.\n\n\u2018\u2018This platform has empowered Nigerians in the diaspora and given you great influence. As we have seen, however, social media can be a force for good as well as a force for evil.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many countries, including our own have had to take strong measures against some social media platforms to curb their excesses and prevent them from destabilizing our societies.\n\n\u2018\u2018I, therefore, call upon you to use social media responsibly. We all want the best for our country and people, so let us strive to build, unite and prosper our nation and people and not to insult and incite from a safe and anonymous distance.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight in the successful involvement of Diaspora in various fields such as agriculture, health care, education, ICT, and the food industry in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that many countries, including Nigeria, have shown that their diaspora can be a veritable engine for growth and development.\n\nAcknowledging the huge contribution the Diaspora have made to Nigeria\u2019s economy, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018In every field of human endeavour, be it the creative industries, sports, health, academia, Nigerians in the diaspora have thrived and leveraged on their skills to raise our country\u2019s profile higher, economically, socially, technologically and culturally.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is for these reasons that this Government established the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) to facilitate and support your engagement with our country for a win-win outcome in our effort to keep Nigerians united at home and abroad.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must continue to be our ambassadors-at-large in your comportment, actions and character.\n\n\u2018\u2018You must excel and be the best in all your endeavours. While here, you must also not forget home as you are the example we want to project to the rest of the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader assured the meeting coordinated by Chairman NIDCOM, Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa that the Federal Government would continue to do everything possible to catalyse development in various fields of the economy.\n\nHe also encouraged them to key into the programmes of NiDCOM, so as to contribute to initiatives such as the Nigerian Diaspora Investment Trust Fund.\n\nNigerian Ambassador to Portugal, Alex Enan Kefas, told President Buhari that records indicate that there are some 3,000 Nigerians living in the country, who are generally well behaved and living peacefully among themselves and the host authorities.\n\nThe Ambassador informed the President of the recent arrest and detention of about thirteen Nigerians for alleged offences of money laundering and cybercrime.\n\nHe explained that the Embassy conducted a consular visit to the prison which revealed that the arrests were \u2018\u2018disproportionate and unjust\u2019\u2019 as many of them were innocent of the allegations.\n\nHe said the Mission is trying its best to ensure the release of the innocent to enable them to reunite with their families.\n\nAt the meeting with the Diaspora, a Nigerian professional footballer, Saviour Godwin, who plays for Portuguese side Casa Pia, presented a jersey to President Buhari.",

Only the US has provided more military aid to Ukraine than the UK.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country needs around $5bn (\u00a34.12bn) a month to fund the war against Russia.",
