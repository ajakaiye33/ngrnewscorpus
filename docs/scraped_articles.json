          "text": ".\n\nBy Samuel Oyadongha\n\nFor people who are predominantly anglers and whose existence revolves around the marine environment, November 2021 is the month they will not forget in a hurry as they are left to ponder how to pick up the pieces of their lives.\n\nThis is because their thriving trade has been rudely halted by massive spills from one of the many wells clustered along the maze of creeks in the once enthralling swathe of mangrove but now choked with offensive smell of crude and contaminated air.\n\nSecurity has since been reinforced in the area ostensibly to prevent any awkward situation in the heavily polluted enclave.\n\nLarge volumes of crude are escaping into the creeks, swamps, farmlands and the Santa Barbara River from a well in the Oil Mining Licence 29 Southwest field in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State operated by an indigenous firm, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO).\n\nThe facility, located at Worikuma-kiri, off Opu-Nembe (Bassambiri), has left the people in quandary.\n\nThe oil well blowout, according to the operator, occurred on November 5, but locals claimed the ruptured was noticed four days earlier, precisely on November 1 and has continued unabated.\n\nEmergency response\n\nThough the company has activated an extensive spillage containment response as witnessed in the area as well as distributing relief materials to the affected communities, the people said they are starving and called on the federal and state governments to come to their aid to assuage their sufferings in the wake of the cessation of their means of livelihood.\n\nThe worst impacted are Worikuma-Kiri, Sand Sand village, Sunny-Kiri I & II, Arow-Kiri, Adamata Kiri and other fishing settlements as thick yellowish substances suspected to be crude oil could be seen floating along the river into the Atlantic Ocean, destroying the aquatic and marine life in the area.\n\nStakeholders have described the raging spill as massive and devastating like the 2010 Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon disaster and the 2012 Chevron KS Endeavour catastrophe that rocked Koluama on the Atlantic of Bayelsa.\n\nAccording to the locals, the offensive stench from the escaping crude mixed with gas is becoming unbearable.\n\nEconomic activities crippled\n\nFishermen and several communities affected by the spill have continued to express anguish over what they described as cessation of their economic livelihood lamenting that the creeks which are also a source of drinking water, cooking and washing, have been polluted. The landlord of Worikuma-Kiri, host to the troubled wellhead, Chief, Worikuma Ivory- Pegi elect, said the crude oil and gas discharge has destroyed his farm and land.\n\nAlso, the Vice President of Opu Nembe Youths, Mr Degi Nimibofa, expressed worry that the spill will have adverse health consequences on the people.\n\nAn indigene, simply identified as Tonye, said, \u201cWe cannot fish and it\u2019s even riskier to embark on the fishing expedition because of the polluted water and charged atmosphere. We are the worst hit since our existence revolves around the water. The stench from the river is horrible.\u201d\n\nHunger looms\n\nHelen Mark, a resident of Sunny-Kiri, one of the impacted settlements, said: \u201cWe have been denied our means of livelihood as we no longer catch fish. We don\u2019t even have fish to cook again, we are starving. From what we are seeing, we might be deprived of fish in the river for a very long time to come.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, an expectant mother, Esther Marcus, noted in frustration, \u201cI will give birth soon and I am yet to buy my baby things complete.\n\n\u201cNow this crude oil on the river has dashed my hope. I was relying on to get money to buy baby things and also take care of my children school fees from fishing but this is not possible at present, we are really suffering.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Erekeduomene Loveday, said life has been difficult for them in the last three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe use to set traps (itolyai or ibinga) mainly for crayfish even in front of this waterfront and other places in our environment but things are no longer the same; the crude has destroyed our fishing gears and denied us our means of livelihood\u201d, Loveday said.\n\n\u201cSince I have been in this place, I have not experienced such magnitude of pollution; it is everywhere in our environment. The water has spread the crude oil everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe crayfish are all dying. The ibinga (tying of leaves together to attract crayfish) that we used to set for crayfish are all soiled with crude oil and so, there is no way to get crayfish now.\u201d\n\nAppeal for assistance\n\nThe locals unanimously called for federal and state government\u2019s assistance to cushion the hardship confronting them saying the relief materials should be brought directly to them in the fishing settlement; as they are the main victims staying away from the main town.\n\nHead of the Bayelsa Field Office of the Environmental Rights Action, Mr Alagoa Morris, noted with sadness that apart from the health hazards from the spills, the residents\u2019 sources of livelihood had been lost, calling on the company to quickly tame the spill.\n\nAlthough he lauded the booms being set by the oil firm to contain further spread of crude into the environment, he nonetheless added that it appears the pressure was much and the booms cannot do the work properly.\n\nThe National Vice President II of the Ijaw National Congress, INC, Alabo Nengi James, submitted that the ecosystem had been adversely impacted as a result of the incident and called on the government to declare it a National Disaster.\n\nTemporary relief\n\nIn a reaction, spokesman for the Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), Operator of the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29, Mr Ndiana Matthew, said the oil firm was containing the spill while distributing relief materials to the impacted communities.\n\nSunday Vanguard was reliably informed that three barges of 1,000 barrels capacity of recovered crude oil had been evacuated from the boomed area and the fourth one being loaded.\n\nAlso, it was reliably learned that relief materials delivered by the oil firm in respect of the incident include 50 bags of beans, 100 bags of garri, 200 bags of rice, 200 bunches of plantain, 200 cartons of chicken, 200 cartons of noodles, 500 packs of 75cl bottle water, 25 bags of salt and 25 cartons of palm oil, among others.\n\nHowever, experts have stressed the need to deploy sufficient oil spill containment and cleanup equipment and personnel to contain the raging spill which has taken over the Santa Barbara River, Swamps and lands and is gradually spreading to other communities in Bayelsa and the Kula axis of Rivers State.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta has said that continuous dialogue between the regulator and its various licensees is central to finding lasting solutions to issues negatively impacting licensee\u2019s compliance with extant regulations and challenging the growth of the telecoms industry.\n\nDanbatta stated this during the second edition of NCC\u2019s 2021 Talk to The Regulator (TTTR) forum held at Four Points by Sheraton, Lagos, over the weekend.\n\nThe theme of the discourse is, \u201cImproving Stakeholders Satisfaction\u201d.\n\nThe Lagos edition of the programme followed the successful hosting of a similar dialogue in Kano on 16th October, 2021.\n\nThe objective of the forum is to get direct feedback from licensees on how the Commission, as a regulator, is meeting licensees\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe programme was also designed to identify areas for regulatory improvement, highlight areas where licensees are defaulting as well as address critical industry challenges undermining full accomplishment of the set objectives for consolidating the gains in the telecoms sector.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, who was represented at the forum by NCC\u2019s Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, the forum is orgainsed in keeping with the Commission\u2019s commitment to continually ensure regulator-licensee interactions to develop collaborative solutions and implementation programmes to the challenges of the telecom ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Communications Act (NCA, 2003) invests the NCC with powers and responsibilities for the regulation of both the technical and market-related aspects of telecoms infrastructure and services in Nigeria. We consider our role as regulator very vital to ensuring industry sustainability, because NCC considers consultation as the lifeblood of regulation,\u201d the EVC emphasised.\n\nThe EVC also declared that, \u201cwe have consistently deployed stakeholder engagement tools like public enquiries, private investigations, written information requests, one-on-one discussions as we are having it now and diverse consumer engagement platforms.\n\n\u201cThese tools enable us to ensure that our interventions are well-grounded and that our decisions are based on a clear understanding of stakeholders\u2019 perspectives\u201d.\n\nDanbatta said that such interactions fit squarely within the five pillars of the Commission\u2019s Strategic Management Plan (2020-2024), which include Regulatory Excellence, Promotion of Universal Broadband Access, the Development of the Digital Economy, Facilitation of Market Development, and Strategic Partnering.\n\n\u201cThrough regular interactions with our licensees, the Commission is able to gain valuable insights to enhance our regulatory output and enabled us to drive excellence in consonance with the five pillars of our strategic vision for the industry as streamlined in the Commission\u2019s Strategic Vision Plan (SVP), 2021-2025,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EVC also reinforced the Commission\u2019s belief that only through optional performance by the licensees will Nigeria be able to achieve the national objectives and targets in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030, the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025 and other national policy instruments targeted at developing the nation\u2019s digital economy ecosystem.\n\nHe said on this basis that the Commission is, \u201cTherefore, we intend to use this forum to seek support for many initiatives that the commission has carefully developed in our quest to enhance market opportunities for all our licensees,\u201d Danbatta said to emphasise NCC\u2019s faith in collaboration with stakeholders and its licensees in order to address any concerns that may impede the attainment of the relevant policy objectives.\n\nThe NCC CEO also emphasised that the Commission will continue to roll out forward-thinking and all-inclusive regulatory initiatives to provide market opportunities for all its licensees. Additionally, Danbatta said NCC is also committed to constantly reviewing licensing framework as well as key regulatory instruments so as to refresh the Commission\u2019s regulatory frameworks and ensure better service delivery for consumers and efficient attainment of other national interest objectives.\n\nHowever, Danbatta said some licensees are not doing as much as they ought to be doing. \u201cSeveral licensees are struggling to pay their staff, many are unable to comply with basic licence obligations, some are defaulting in the payment of their Annual Operating Levies (AOL) while the level of interconnect and other inter-licensee indebtedness is still unacceptably high.\n\nTherefore, we are required to ensure regulatory interventions are put in place to address challenges, bottlenecks and grievances that may arise among the licensees in this regard,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso addressing the gathering, the Director, Licensing and Authorisation at NCC, Mohammed Babajika, said the forum was intended to foster a harmonious relationship with licensees, identify their challenges and provide feedback on licensees\u2019 fulfilment of their licence obligations and to re-emphasise the role of licensees in ensuring good quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for the consumers.\n\nWhile intimating the licensees of some regulatory initiatives focused on licensing issues, Babajika said despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its resultant challenges, the Commission was taking measures to further liberalise the telecoms industry by finalising the framework for Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) while also reviewing existing licensing regulations.\n\nIn addition, the Director also informed the licensees that the Commission was finalising work on Information Memorandum (IM) for Fifth Generation (5G) technology deployment, which will promote emerging technology trends such as Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Over-The-Top (OTT) Services and Big Data Analytics, Blockchain, among others.\n\nAt the event, presentations were made by Management staff of the Commission to the licensees and others, who participated actively through listening, making observations and suggestions, as well as seeking clarifications to improve the quality of discourse and the expected outcomes.",

Dr. Emmanuel Chukwuma has asked the Federal Government to jettison the idea of paying N5,000 palliative to 40 million Nigerians.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the Government said the decision was to cushion the effect of the planned removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nBut Archbishop Chukwuma, who rejected the removal of subsidy, described the proposed N5,000 palliative \u201cas a huge disgrace.\u201d\n\nHe said this during a press conference on the activities lined up for the 50th Anniversary of the Enugu Diocese, Anglican Communion.\n\nWhile noting that the Enugu Diocese was concerned about the level of governance of Nigeria, he added that \u201cwe are also concerned about peace and the unity of Nigeria, as well as infrastructural development.\u201d\n\nHe called on the government \u201cto be sensitive about the situation of Nigeria; we frown against the killings, the banditry, the kidnappings, inequality, injustice and all the evils.\n\n\u201cOf late, we can see how \u2018Mkpurummiri\u2019 is destroying our youths, it is highly condemnable. We are calling on our youths to please avoid this so that they don\u2019t get their heads out of order. This is not how they will become future leaders.\n\n\u201cRight now, I want to say that the government of Nigeria has not treated the South-East fairly; particularly now that we are getting into the yuletide, Enugu-Onitsha Expressway is a total disaster, Enugu-Port Harcourt they are putting it to use but it is not yet complete.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the minister of works to stop playing pranks and politics with the roads in the South-East. Rail transport should also be extended to the South-East; we see no reason the minister of transport should neglect his own zone.\n\n\u201cIt is important for our government to know that most youths are angry; they are angry because they are hungry. I just heard about giving N5,000 to 50 million Nigerians, it is a disgrace. It will not bring any positives on our people. We are also frowning at galloping inflation.\n\n\u201cOur naira is becoming useless and something must be done about it. E-naira or whatever is not the solution at all.\u201d\n\nHe also called on the residents of South-East not to toy with the on-going voter\u2019s registration exercise, stressing that \u201cthese things count; South-East should stop shortchanging themselves; that\u2019s the only way they will have a say in 2023.\u201d\n\nOn the Church\u2019s anniversary, Archbishop Chukwuma disclosed that, \u201cIt became a Diocese in August 1970; exactly last year August, Enugu became 50 years of its inauguration with the first Bishop, Rt, Rev. Gideon Nweke Otubelu. By the grace of God, he championed the course of Enugu Diocese for 27 years.\n\n\u201cLast year, when it became 50 years of Enugu\u2019s inauguration as a Diocese, we could not celebrate because of COVID; we had to shift it to this year.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have mapped out a one-week anniversary programme to celebrate the 50 years of Enugu Diocese. We started with a crusade which is going to last till Sunday and we have decided that from last week of this month, we will have activities from church to church, and rally, and then end it up with thanksgiving service on the 5th of December at the Cathedral Church of the Good Shepherd.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, the two days out of it all are the 4th and the 5th of December. On the 4th, we shall be having a rally at the Christ Church field, where all the churches will assemble to have a rally for the 50th anniversary and they are going to march, church by church, archdeaconry by archdeaconry and so on.\n\n\u201cThere, we will also have a dedication anniversary of the diagnostic centre of our hospital at the Good Shepherd Specialist Hospital, Uwani, Zik Avenue. The diagnostic centre is necessary to complement the hospital because we believe in health care, we believe in mission; on that same 12th, we are also going to dedicate a building built by the women at the Bethen Home Convent.\n\n\u201cThen on the 5th of December, which is Sunday, will be thanksgiving day, during which all the churches in the diocese and the dioceses created out of Enugu, 11 of them will also participate. Enugu has given birth to 11 Dioceses, with Enugu making it 12, forming what is now the ecclesiastical province of Enugu, for which I\u2019m the Archbishop. We have the Nsukka Diocese, Abakaliki, Oji-River, Enugu North, Awgu-Aninri, Nike, Mgbo, Afikpo, Udi and Eha-Amufu Dioceses.\n\n\u201cEnugu Diocese is out to execute pragmatic evangelism; Enugu Diocese is out to make sure that we care for the poor, the less privileged, the widows, orphans and those who are displaced.\u201d",

          "title": "APC governors move to hijack presidential ticket",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe cold war raging in the All Progressives Congress (APC), especially between the APC progressive governors and the Presidency over zoning of the party\u2019s positions and the 2023 presidential ticket deepened at the weekend.\n\nContrary to speculations that the governors were sharply divided in support of two frontline presidential aspirants, a reliable source told Sunday Sun that the major disagreement within the party currently is the insistence by the governors that one of them must emerge the party\u2019s candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nReferencing what transpired during the regime of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the source claimed that the progressive governors are pressuring President Muhammadu Buhari to endorse the arrangements for one of them to emerge as the presidential candidate of the ruling party ahead of other contenders.\n\nOur source equally disclosed that there are indications that the northern caucus of the party has finally conceded the presidential ticket to the South, adding that the final agreement is that while all the party positions hitherto held by the North will henceforth automatically shift to the South and vice-versa, the North-central will produce the party\u2019s national chairman in the planned February national convention.\n\n\u201cThe governors are hell-bent on one of them emerging as the party\u2019s standard bearer for the 2023 presidential poll and they are not bulging on it. They have taken their resolutions to Mr President, including the appeal that he endorses the plans for one of them to pick the presidential ticket of the party. The governors had specifically reminded Mr President on the need to toe the line of former President Obasanjo in the 2007 presidential election by supporting and possibly influencing any of them picking the ticket for the 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cHowever, you know the kind of person Mr President is. Expectedly, the governors did not get a desired categorical response from him. It is certain that he will not brazenly or autocratically impose any candidate on the party members, but he will certainly play a vital role in influencing who gets the ticket,\u201d the source submitted.\n\nExplaining further the political undercurrent and dynamics ahead of the 2023 general elections, our source said that despite the insistence of the majority of the governors on one of them picking the ticket, there are, however, some of them equally supporting the proposal for former President Goodluck Jonathan to be given the ticket with one of them becoming his vice.\n\n\u201cAgain, there is some level of division in the camp of the governors because while some of them are rooting for frontline contenders like Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu and/or the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, there are an insignificant number of them rooting for former President Jonathan with one of them as the vice president, just as greater percentage of them are favourably disposed to one of their own getting the ticket,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn the zoning arrangements for the party\u2019s national leadership positions, our source disclosed that what is perhaps becoming certain was that the leadership of the party in the North may have settled for production of the party\u2019s national leadership positions, conceding the presidential ticket to the South.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is too early to confirm the permutations of which zone will get the presidential ticket or where it will be micro-zoned, what is, however, certain is that the leaders of the party have unanimously agreed that all the party\u2019s leadership positions formally occupied by the South should go to the North. That must be the reason the North-central has been tactically endorsed to produce the party\u2019s national chairmanship position.\n\n\u201cWith this arrangement, it is therefore easy to conclude that the North has also conceded the presidential ticket to the South for now. But I must have to add that this agreement is not yet cast on the marble because there are still several contending forces that may change the political dynamics, especially the tricks by the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Whatever resolutions we arrive at now will be highly dependent on how things unfold in the camp of other political parties because we are not operating in isolation,\u201d the source said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Yet, I can never forget the outpouring of love that you, umu nne m, showed him. In life and in death, you stood with him.\n\n\u201cSince that fateful day 10 years ago, Okenwa, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, who in his lifetime took the baton of fighting for our people, has also taken it upon himself to celebrate my father year after year. As he honoured the Ikemba in life, he has continued to honour him in death.\n\n\u201cIn these almost 10 years, no state governor in the Southeast has done this incredible and noble task, despite the fact that Ezeigbo Gburugburu was our leader through a war to save us from the genocide that faced our people.\n\n\u201cToday, we live in a world where many prefer to forget the battles which were waged to bring us this far, the sacrifices of so many in this unrelenting quest to end our marginalisation and the continued fight for a just and equitable state that we can live in without oppression. Nobody without passion for his people and a spirit of sacrifice can lead us to the Promised Land, no matter how genuine their intentions may be.\n\n\u201cToday, as we remember the passing of my father, let us celebrate our resilience as a people. Biafra remains the only country that required the combined effort of three of the world\u2019s greatest superpowers to come together to subdue\u2026it remains the first country where starvation was employed as an instrument of war. Even then, this remarkable country survived for three whole years.\n\n\u201cThe ingenuity of our engineers gave birth to \u2018Ogbunigwe\u2019- a multiple re-entry missile. We refined our own petrol.

We had order\u2026and when compared to the situation we are faced with today, I think we can look back and say that we, as a people, are incomparable.\n\n\u201cLet us also continue to honour all our loved ones who lost their lives during the war. And never forget the foreigners who left the comfort of their homes to fight for us and with us. We can never forget all the countries that came to our aid, provided refuge and support in our time of need.\n\n\u201cWe remember Bruce Mayrock, that young man, even younger than me, who took our plight to heart, so much so that he gave his life for us, just to make the world look and see the evil being perpetrated against us.

Is Nigeria going to receive the South African President and other officials when other countries are banning travellers from South Africa? Is the federal government going to tell them not to come? Under what structure are they going to come?\u201d a top official of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) queried.\n\nThe visit will be President Ramaphosa\u2019s first visit to Nigeria in his official capacity as the substantive president since he was elected some three years ago.\n\nHe had visited Nigeria in 2018, as the acting president, following the exit of former President Jacob Zuma from office.\n\nThere are about 120 South African firms in Nigeria, including the telecommunication giant, MTN, DSTV whose parent company, Multichoice, remains the number one leading player in the cable TV ecosystem in the country.\n\nHowever, only a few Nigerian firms are operating in South Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "In a Tribute to De Klerk, Gusau Highlights Nigeria\u2019s Role to End Apartheid Regime",
          "text": "\u2022Says Thatcher asked Nigeria to ascertain S\u2019African leader\u2019s commitment to majority rule\n\nEjiofor Alike\n\nA former National Security Adviser (NSA), Lieutenant General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau (rtd), has highlighted Nigeria\u2019s role to end the apartheid regime in South Africa.\n\nIn a tribute to the former President of South Africa, the late Frederik Willem de Klerk, which was obtained by THISDAY, Gusau disclosed that the then British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, had specifically asked the former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida to ascertain the commitment of De Klerk to majority rule.\n\nDe Klerk, who was the last minority president of South Africa, later became the late President Nelson Mandela\u2019s deputy under the majority rule.\n\nGusau stated that Thatcher had in 1989 visited Nigeria twice within one week where he told Babangida that de Klerk was working to bring an end to minority rule in South Africa.\n\nAccording to the former NSA, Thatcher also sought the help of Nigeria to ascertain the level of de Klerk\u2019s commitment and also strengthen de Klerk\u2019s efforts.\n\nGusau noted that while Babangida believed that Thatcher was an honest broker on the issue, the former military leader had doubts as to whether de Klerk meant business or that he would get the support of the white establishment in South Africa\n\nThe former NSA described the late former president of South African as a towering figure who was determined to right historical wrongs without minding the consequences.\n\nGusau said Nigeria\u2019s strategic role to end apartheid started on March 28, 1989, when, on her way to South Africa, the then British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher decided to do a stop-over in Lagos to see Babangida.\n\nThe former NSA quoted Thatcher as telling journalists at the airport that she was very \u201chappy to accept President Babangida\u2019s invitation to stop over in Lagos to have talks with him.\n\n\u201cI do this because I have great admiration for the leadership he is giving here and for the courageous way in which he is tackling the economic problems of the country,\u201d she had added.\n\nThatcher had also disclosed that since she and Babangida would be attending the Commonwealth Conference CHOGM scheduled to hold in Malaysia in October of that year, her visit was an opportunity to chat with the Nigerian leader ahead of the conference.\n\nGusau said the former British Prime Minister also took a few questions after her brief remarks, which were all centred around the situation in South Africa and the role of Britain at the time.\n\n\u201cWhile she was evasive in her responses, Mrs. Thatcher alluded to a meeting between Soviet and British academics and the ANC \u2018in which they urged that the problems of South Africa be solved not by confrontation, not by violence, but by negotiation. That is our objective too.\u2019 By her return itinerary, Mrs. Thatcher was to do a brief stop-over in Accra, to see President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, before heading for London. But she again routed her flight from South Africa through Lagos where she met President Babangida for a second time within a week,\u201d Gusau explained.\n\nGusau stated that Babangida later invited him for a briefing after Thatcher\u2019s visits and saddled him with what he (Gusau) described as a delicate assignment.\n\nRevealing what transpired between him and Babangida, the former NSA stated that the former military president informed him that Thatcher had told him (Babangida) in their two meetings that de Klerk was working to bring an end to minority rule in South Africa.\n\nGusau also disclosed that Babangida told him that the former British leader sought the help of Nigeria to ascertain the level de Klerk\u2019s commitment and also see how Nigeria could strengthen de Klerk\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cWhile President Babangida said he believed Mrs. Thatcher as an honest broker on the issue, he had doubts as to whether President de Klerk meant business or that he would get the support of the white establishment in South Africa on such idea. The assignment President Babangida then gave me was to ascertain how serious President de Klerk was on ending apartheid in South Africa as well as what Nigeria could do to help that process,\u201d Gusau said.\n\nThe former NSA also disclosed that after Babangida had given him a list of contacts within the South African government, including close aides of President de Klerk, he decided to co-opt his Chief of Staff, Colonel Kayode Are into the assignment given to him by the former military ruler.\n\n\u201cColonel Are was not only my chief of staff at the time but also a close friend whose opinion I deeply valued. The two of us embarked on this extraordinary mission with no time to spare. We first met with the then Director-General of South Africa\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS), Dr. Niel Barnard, in London on 15th January 1990. That marked the beginning of a long and enduring partnership between our two institutions, and I visited South Africa several times thereafter to discuss the way forward. I also had direct sessions with President de Klerk who, in our first meeting, made it clear that he wanted to be the last minority president. I was a bit skeptical about that even though he sounded genuine,\u201d Gusau explained.\n\n\u201cOn 2nd February 1990, while we were still working underground with their security officials, President de Klerk took the world by surprise. In his address at the opening session of parliament, he announced the end of segregation of public facilities in South Africa, recognised the African National Congress (ANC) as a legitimate political party, and set a date for the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of incarceration. Not surprisingly, as de Klerk made his speech, there were shouts of \u2018traitor\u2019 from several MPs within his own Conservative Party, who staged a dramatic walk-out. One of them, Koos van der Merwe later addressed the media where he described de Klerk as a traitor to his people\u2019 because, by the declaration, the then South African president was \u201ctrying to kill the Afrikaner nation,\u201d Gusau added.\n\nGusau said de Klerk\u2019s historic speech had led to far-reaching political reforms and had also marked the beginning of the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa.\n\nHe said he visited de Klerk four weeks later in Cape Town with a letter from Babangida, adding that the culmination of their discussion was a meeting between both presidents in Windhoek on March 31, 1990, at the sidelines of Namibia\u2019s Independence Day celebration.\n\n\u201cMuch more significantly, however, five senior Nigerian journalists were in Namibia for the event. When I sounded them out about whether they would like to visit South Africa, they were excited. I discussed the idea with South African officials, and it was agreed that they could undertake a visit. A vehicle was provided for the long journey that took almost 20 hours from Windhoek to Johannesburg. The reports filed by these top journalists when they returned to Nigeria validated most of what Colonel Are and I had witnessed which confirmed that De Klerk was moving in the direction of majority rule,\u201d Gusau said.\n\nGusau noted that at some point, he discovered that while Nigeria\u2019s engagements with South African officials were cordial and fruitful, it was also necessary to brief the leader of Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.\n\nHe said he had received the feedback from reliable South African contacts that Buthelezi was aware of Nigerian mediation, stressing that as a critical factor in the country, Buthelezi needed to be carried along.\n\n\u201cPresident Babangida wrote him a letter. Having welcomed the idea, the South African Government provided the plane that took me to Ulundi, capital of Zulu Kingdom where Chief Buthelezi was happy to receive me. He called his entire cabinet before reading President Babangida\u2019s letter. There and then he asked the Cabinet Secretary to draft a reply. I then drove with him to the statute of their ancestral warrior, Shaka Zulu where we took photographs before I flew back to Johannesburg,\u201d Gusau explained.\n\nGusau said although he and Colonel Are worked underground in their engagements with the South African government, some of their colleagues within the continent alleged that high-ranking Nigerian officials were collaborating with the apartheid regime, adding that a few African leaders were uncomfortable with the information.\n\nHe, however, stated that the problem was left for Babangida to handle with his colleagues.\n\n\u201cIn April 1992, President de Klerk undertook a three-day State Visit to Nigeria at the invitation of President Babangida. The visit was the first by a South African head of state to our country, and President Babangida\u2014who was at that period chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (now African Union)\u2014signaled to the continent and the rest of the world that Nigeria supported President De Klerk in his efforts. This certainly was the key to South Africa\u2019s acceptance by the rest of the continent.\n\n\u201cFollowing President de Klerk\u2019s death on 11th November this year, his office issued a prerecorded posthumous video where he tendered an apology for \u201cthe pain and the hurt and the indignity and the damage that apartheid has done to black, brown and Indians in South Africa.\u201d I believe he genuinely meant what he said.\n\n\u201cIn their tribute, the Mandela Foundation said that President de Klerk would \u201cforever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history\u201d while President Cyril Ramaphosa said de Klerk \u201ctook the courageous decision [as president] to unban political parties, release political prisoners and enter into negotiations with the liberation movement amid severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I reflect on the legacy of the late President de Klerk, I am reminded of the extraordinary things ordinary people can achieve. It took great courage for President de Klerk to stand up to the white establishment in South Africa after which he accepted the position of a deputy in President Nelson Mandela\u2019s ANC-led Government of National Unity. He will therefore be remembered as a peacemaker who changed the course of history in his country. And I am grateful for the part that Nigeria played in supporting his efforts while I salute the courage of President Babangida for taking the right decision at the time,\u201d Gusau concluded.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Set to Establish Int\u2019l Financial Centre at Eko Atlantic City",
          "text": "\u2022Targets pool of global funds\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has disclosed plans by the apex bank to set up an International Financial Centre at the Eko Atlantic City in Lagos to be operational in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nEmefiele explained that the facility is expected to serve as a hub for attracting domestic and external capital which is much-needed to strengthen the Nigerian economy post-COVID-19.\n\nThe CBN governor stated this in a keynote address he delivered at the 56th Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) annual dinner held in Lagos at the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe International Finance Centre when fully operational in the 2nd quarter of 2022, will help to position Nigeria as a key destination for investment in Africa,\u201d Emefiele added.\n\nThe CBN governor noted that a key challenge to supporting growth in key sectors of the economy was access to large pools of cheap investment capital, adding that over $100 trillion was being held by institutional investors in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.\n\nAccording to him, most of the funds were invested in low-yielding assets relative to high-yielding opportunities in Nigeria.\n\nFurthermore, Emefiele noted that although uncertainties remained around the mutating Delta virus, prospects of a broad-based economic recovery in Nigeria were bright as efforts were being made to improve access to vaccines for Nigerians, in addition to measures aimed at implementing safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that \u201cour economic growth remains fragile, as our unemployment and inflation rate remains at levels that are not very supportive of growth. Second, continued implementation of our intervention efforts would need to be undertaken to sustain the recovery efforts and stimulate further growth of the economy.\n\n\u201cThird, given population growth at about 2.7 per cent annually, it is important that we continue to deploy measures that will enable our economy to attain annual growth rates of over five per cent.\n\n\u201cThrough the pandemic, we are aware that our policy responses are often more effective when we work with the private sector. For example, the CACOVID alliance played an instrumental role in reducing the negative effects of the pandemic, by providing palliative support to families affected by the virus and in rebuilding our healthcare institutions.\n\n\u201cLeveraging the strength of the private sector will be critical in mobilising funds that are needed toward building a more resilient and stronger economy. We intend to strengthen collaborations with the private sector to support investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, and ICT, in addition to ongoing efforts to build a stronger agriculture and manufacturing base in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a result, all efforts in 2022 must be made to ensure that we maintain our focus on improving access to finance and credit for households and businesses, mobilising investment to boost domestic productivity, enabling faster growth of non-oil exports, and supporting employment generating activities,\u201d he explained.\n\nCommenting on the recently introduced 100 for 100 policy on production and productivity, he reiterated that the programme targets credit of up to N5 billion to be provided to 100 firms every 100 days, provided that the firms are investing in projects that are Greenfield projects.\n\nSecondly, projects would be assessed on their ability to generate significant employment opportunities in critical sectors of the economy, he added.\n\nThirdly on the 100 for 100 policy, he pointed out that eligible firms must show evidence of their efforts to harness available local raw materials towards the realisation of their intended investment.\n\nEmefiele also said efforts would be made to support firms geared towards producing goods for the export market.\n\n\u201cLet me add that routine audits will be conducted on firms that receive funding, to ensure that they are complying with the terms of the program. We believe this program will significantly help to catalyse growth in critical sectors of our economy while aiding our efforts to create employment opportunities and reduce our dependence on imported goods.\n\n\u201cA key focus of the Central Bank of Nigeria under my leadership has been enabling the build-out of a robust payment system in Nigeria that will provide cheap, efficient, and faster means of conducting payments for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWith the growing pace of digitisation globally, it is essential that we leverage digital channels in fulfilling this objective. Total transaction volumes using digital channels more than doubled between 2018 and 2020, as volumes rose from 1.3 billion to over 3.3 billion financial transactions in 2020.\n\n\u201cDigital payment channels also help to support continued conduct of business activities during the lockdown. Our robust payment system has continued to evolve towards meeting the needs of households and businesses in Nigeria. Reflective of the confidence in our payment system, between 2015 and September 2021, about $900 million has been invested in firms run by Nigerian founders.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding these gains, close to 36 per cent of adult Nigerians do not have access to financial services. Improving access to finance for individuals and businesses through digital channels can help to improve financial inclusion, lower the cost of transactions, and increase the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\n\u201cIt is in this vein that the Central Bank of Nigeria recently deployed the first central bank digital currency in Africa, the e-Naira, which would help in attaining our goals of fostering greater inclusion using digital channels, supporting cross border payments for businesses and firms, and providing a reliable channel for remittance inflows into the country.\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira will ensure that Nigerians in remote areas can conduct financial activities using their digital devices at little or no cost. It will also help to strengthen the effectiveness of government intervention programs, as funds provided will get to the intended beneficiaries. In less than four weeks since its launch, almost 600,000 downloads of the e-naira application have taken place.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEfforts are ongoing to encourage faster adoption of the e-naira by Nigerians who do not have smartphones. The support of the financial industry will be critical in the ongoing deployment of the e-naira and efforts are ongoing to encourage continued partnership between the CBN and stakeholders in the financial industry.\n\n\u201cWith the decline in revenues due to federal and state government as a result of reduced receipts from the sale of crude oil, alternative ways of funding infrastructure are critical if we are to ensure sustained growth of our economy. As we are all aware, the cost of logistics is often seen as a significant impediment to the growth of businesses in the country.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the role improved infrastructure could play in the development of our economy, along with the need to leverage private sector capital in funding the over N35 trillion deficit, which is the estimated amount required to build an efficient infrastructure ecosystem in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria working in partnership with critical stakeholders such as the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and African Finance Corporation (AFC) set up Infracorp. Infracorp is expected to raise over N15 trillion to support investment in critical infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo far, N1 trillion has been provided as seed funds by the promoters to support the operations of Infracorp. We recently appointed four fund managers, and a Management Team has been selected to run and manage Infracorp.\n\n\u201cOver the next two months, Infracorp will kick off its operations by targeting strategic infrastructure projects that would help catalyse further growth of our economy. Infracorp is expected to set the standard template that will help in enabling greater private sector funding for public infrastructure projects in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the outlook for 2022, Emefiele revealed that CBN\u2019s in-house model, after an exhaustive simulation with various oil price possibilities and numerous scenarios of other macroeconomic metrics, indicates a continued and strong rebound of the domestic economy.\n\nHe said the near-term outlook of the Nigerian economy was brightening significantly, with improvements projected into the short- and the medium-term. He projected that the real GDP growth rate would remain robust and strengthen within the short term.\n\n\u201cOutput growth rate is projected to remain positive from 4.03 per cent in 2021q3 to nearly 2.91 per cent in 2021 fourth quarter, implying a total growth of about 3.10 percent for 2021. The short-term projection indicates a continued strengthening of the growth rate.\n\n\u201cDeliberate structural policies and reforms are needed to raise this projected trend higher towards the desired five per cent average growth level.\n\n\u201cOutput growth rate for the Nigerian economy is broadly estimated by key institutions to consolidate in 2021. The IMF and the World Bank project real growth rates of 2.6 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively while the estimate by the Federal Ministry of Finance and National planning stands at 3.0 per cent.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the real GDP growth rate is projected to remain robust and strengthen within the short-term, regardless of the immanent vulnerabilities. With this continued strengthening, real GDP could recover beyond the pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of 2022. Further simulations of the medium-term projections suggest that Nigeria\u2019s real GDP could surpass pre-COVID trends by 2024.\n\n\u201cThe business environment remains optimistic given the sustained policy interventions in the economy. The overall business confidence index is projected to rise significantly from -9.2 index points as at end-August to over 37.7 index points in November 2021 and surpass 57.6 index points by mid-2022,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*PSC vows to resist attempt to hijack its mandate\n\n*Force yet to approach S\u2019Court after losing at A\u2019Court\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe last has not been heard of the tussle between the Police Service Commission (PSC) and the Nigerian Police over the recruitment of 10,000 police constables, as both organisations are planning separate exercises for 2021.\n\nThe PSC, had on Wednesday, in Abuja, disclosed that as soon as the 2020 recruitment exercise for which the aptitude test was conducted last week, was concluded, the commission would begin the 2021 exercise.\n\nBut the Inspector General of Police (IG), Usman Alkali Baba, at the weekend called for applications from suitably qualified applicants for the 2021 recruitment exercise.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in 2018 given approval for the recruitment of 60,000 police constables for six years.\n\nThe 2020 recruitment exercise, however, ran into troubled waters when the police insisted that it had the mandate to recruit constables.\n\nBut the PSC had stood its ground, also insisting that it was constitutionally empowered to conduct recruitment for the police.\n\nThe exercise soon became a subject of litigation with the police under the former Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, winning the first round at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe ruling of the high court was later set aside by the Court of Appeal which declared that the Police Service Commission was constitutionally empowered to conduct recruitment of police constables.\n\nWhile the police authorities had given the impression that they would challenge the judgment at the Supreme Court, they were yet to approach the apex court.\n\nOn resumption of duties as the new police chief, Alkali Baba had visited the PSC, and in the spirit of reconciliation, called on the PSC to resume its duties giving the impression that the litigation saga was over.\n\nThe two agencies later held a one-day retreat at the Force Headquarters on the way forward.\n\nBut at a briefing in Abuja, Chairman of the PSC, Mr. Musiliu Smith, a retired Inspector-General of Police, stated that as soon as the 2020 exercise which was delayed by the litigations, was concluded, the commission would embark on the recruitment of another 10,000 for 2021 and subsequently kick-start the 2022 edition in fulfillment of the presidential directive for the recruitment of 60,000 police constables.\n\nHe said the position of the commission became necessary following repeated calls and inquiries from Nigerians on whether the commission was part of the process of the ongoing completion of the 2020 recruitment exercise.\n\nHe said aptitude tests for shortlisted applicants from the earlier suspended 2020 recruitment were held on Friday, October 29, and Saturday, October 30, 2021, across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cMr. President, had, in 2018, approved the recruitment of 10,000 Nigerians annually into the constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force for six years. This is to inject needed additional personnel and to bridge the manpower gap in the force, especially with the resurgence of banditry, terrorism, and kidnapping in different parts of the country and regular loss of personnel through dismissal, retirement, natural death, accident, and others\u201d, he said.\n\nThe retired IG said the 2020 recruitment exercise which was suspended midway was the third edition after the successful 2018 and 2019 exercises.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to state that the ongoing completion of the suspended 2020 edition was a joint decision of the commission and that of the Nigeria Police Force and it was meant to further fast-track the injection of required personnel into the force. A joint committee of the commission and that of the Nigeria Police Force met severally in the commission and approved a timeline for the completion of the exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that with the completion of the aptitude tests across the country recently, successful candidates were undergoing medical examinations at the 17 zonal police headquarters in the country after which fit and proper 10,000 candidates would be recruited by the commission and sent to the police colleges/training schools for training.\n\n\u201cThe commission is aware of the manpower gaps in the Nigeria Police Force especially with rapid wastages of officers and men due to many reasons earlier highlighted.\n\n\u201cThe commission wishes to commend Mr. President for his kind and gracious approval for the recruitment of 10,000 Nigerians into the constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force continuously for six years. We are grateful to the National Assembly for the support in approving releases of required funds for this exercise,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the litigation, the PSC chair hinted that the police might still be forging ahead with the court matter.\n\n\u201cThe Appeal Court delivered a favourable judgment to PSC. They (police) have given the impression that they want to go to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe will encourage them to go there because that is the highest court in the land\u201d, he added.\n\nBut the police high command at the weekend called for applications from suitably qualified applicants for the 2021 recruitment exercise.\n\nThe public notice titled: \u201c2021 Recruitment into the Nigeria Police Force,\u201d said in the first paragraph that \u201cthe Nigeria Police Force (NPF) in conjunction with the Police Service Commission (PSC) invites applications from interested and qualified Nigerians for enlistment into the Nigeria Police Force as Police Constable (Recruits)\u201d.\n\nHowever, a top official of the PSC told THISDAY yesterday that the commission would resist any attempt to hijack or undermine its mandate.\n\n\u201cThe commission is amazed and disappointed by the development but will resist any attempt to hijack or undermine its mandate,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Court of Appeal had in its judgment, declared that the Police Act 2020, enacted in September of the same year as it affects the constitutional mandate of the Police Service Commission is unconstitutional and void.\n\nThe provision of the Act, it ruled, was obviously in conflict with paragraph 30 Part 1 of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, which empowers the commission to appoint persons into offices in the Nigeria Police Force except for the office of the Inspector General of Police.\n\nThe details of the Appeal Court judgment in the appeal instituted by the commission against the ruling of the Federal High Court in Abuja, was contained in the Certified True Copy (CTC) received by the Commission on Tuesday, October 13, 2020.\n\nJustice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, one of the three Justices of the Court in his concurrent judgment, ruled that Paragraph 30 of Part 1 of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution gives the power to the commission to appoint persons into offices in the Nigeria Police \u201cand did not exclude constables and cadets to Nigeria Police Academy from offices in the Nigeria Police into which the appellant can appoint persons\u201d\n\nHe further declared that no Act of the National Assembly or law can take away or curtail such power.\n\nJustice Agim noted that even if the Nigeria Police carried out the disputed enlistment under a directive or approval of the President of the federation, \u201cthe enlistment would remain contrary to the Constitution and therefore unconstitutional and void. Such a directive cannot repair its unconstitutionality and illegality\u201d.\n\nIn the lead judgment delivered by Justice Olabisi Ige, the Court of Appeal gave a declaration that by Section 1 subsection 3 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) \u201cany piece of legislation or instrument relied upon by the defendants (including but not limited to the Police Act and the Police Regulations) in exercising or purporting to exercise the powers to appoint, promote, dismiss or discipline persons holding or aspiring to hold offices in the Nigeria Police Force, being inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution particularly section 153 subsection (1)(m), Section 153 subsection (2) and section 215(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and Paragraph 30 part 1 of the Third Schedule to the Constitution, is invalid, null and void and of no effect whatsoever\u201d\n\nIt also gave an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Police, and other defendants, jointly and severally, from interfering or further interfering in any manner howsoever with the commission\u2019s discharge of its constitutional and statutory functions in \u201crespect of the appointment, promotion, dismissal, or exercise of disciplinary control over persons holding or aspiring to hold offices in the Nigeria Police Force other than the Inspector General of Police\u201d.\n\nAttempt to reach Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, was unsuccessful, as he did not respond to text messages sent to his mobile phone on the issue.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "ENGAGEMENTS BY Chidi Amuta\n\nThe Nigerian diaspora has lately graduated into both an economic proposition and a grave strategic concern. Our diaspora home remittances have ballooned to anywhere between $24 to $30 billion since 2019. Many Nigerian professionals and entrepreneurs are making positive headlines for their successes in good things and in key places of the world. Yet plane loads of not so fortunate Nigerians are periodically being deported from bad places or hundreds of us are being tossed into jails around the world for acts that unsettle their host countries and embarrass our government. But love or hate us, our face has become an unmistakable international brand and a perpetual road show of who we are at home. Out there in the world, we are a sea of inherent goodness spiced with a few bad guys.\n\nAn evacuation flight earlier this week landed in Lagos from Libya. It disgorged 350 Nigerians hurriedly evacuated from Libya, a transit country for desperate Africans risking the Mediterranean crossing into Europe in search of a better life. These ones are lucky to return home alive. Others have perished in the process while many who made the great crossing ended up in punishing jails in Europe.\n\nFor good or bad reasons, Nigerians are streaming out through legal and illegal routes. While some seek legitimate livelihoods and are going to other lands through the front door, others are trekking across the Sahara or joining bad boats to cross the Mediterranean in search of scraggy livelihoods in Europe. The make shift dangerous boats are not exactly the slave ships that took our kith and kin trough the middle passage to America in the days of the slave trade. Those were forced cargoes; the new boat people are voluntary exiles who believe that dangerous journeys in search of a better life are better than death in installments at home.\n\nYet the bulging Nigerian diaspora is a dual heritage. Ever so frequently, we learn of collections of worthy Nigerians doing good things for themselves and thus glorifying the nation in the process. Some of them have risen to the pinnacle of enterprise, research and technocracy in the countries where they have settled. In our new embrace with the world, we have exported the very exceptional, those who went out to study and pursue the highest levels of perfection in almost every field. Some are top scientists in NASA and leading research laboratories. Others are leading lights in the best branches of academia, some of the best brains in public and corporate bureaucracies in the West. There are also plain ordinary honest Nigerians who went out there in search of the good life for their families and for work environments in which proficient men and women seek access to the best facilities for honest work and dignified labour. There are the new breed of tech entrepreneurs for whom there are no limits.\n\nBut the ones that make most of the news are the nasty oases of shame and ugliness that look more like exaggerated versions of our ugliness at home.\n\nThe ugly Nigerian is perennially out there on display. The internet fraudsters, the violent robbers, the rough ladies of the night, the common thief in search of an unguarded victim and the loud and loquacious crook and con man in search of prey. The desperation of some of our nationals in the diaspora has been increased by the economic adversity and poverty at home. This has created a hunger for quick material and financial \u2018arrival\u2019. This is what is driving the new spirit of insane money \u2018spraying\u2019 at parties and the bandying of financial figures in billions that has led many unguarded youth into internet scams and all manner of \u201cYahoo\u2026 Yahoo\u201d exploits for quick quantum wealth. Dark offshoots of this macabre acquisitive instinct include a new spate of ritual murder, trafficking in human body parts and of course the fashionable industry of kidnapping for ransom.\n\nInevitably, the news is dominated by the ugly Nigerians who get into trouble in foreign lands for criminal infractions and acts of lawlessness. A few weeks ago, four Nigerians were arrested in Dubai for daylight bank robbery in the Sharjah principality. Those familiar with the order and tranquility of Dubai would readily testify that this is an aberration, a pattern of crime that is strange to the United Arab Emirates in general. Other Nigerians have similarly been arrested in the UAE for offences ranging from prostitution to sundry theft and fraud.\n\nEasily the biggest single incident is the multi million dollar internet fraud syndicate involving Mr. Ramon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi for which he was arrested in Dubai and is standing trial in the United States. The tourist haven of Dubai was until recently the favourite trading and holiday destination for a number of Nigerians. Bilateral air services arrangements are in distress just as the work permits of well over 500 Nigerians were recently not renewed for reasons not unconnected with the general conduct of ugly Nigerians. As at 2019, the Nigerian Ambassador to UAE Mr. Mohammed Rimi revealed that 446 Nigerians were in Dubai prisons. Today\u2019s figures are more disconcerting.\n\nSimilarly in India, incidents involving law enforcement have recently caught quite a number of Nigerians on the wrong side. Clashes between Indian police and members of the Nigerian community have been quite frequent. In one recent incident, a Nigerian died ostensibly after an encounter with Indian police. An officer from the Nigerian High Commission went to inquire. He was attacked and his official vehicle destroyed. When the Indian police intervened, there was a revolt by the Nigerian community in the area. They went as far as blocking a highway which led to the mass arrest of Nigerians. As it turned out, most of the Nigerians involved in the rampage were illegal and undocumented immigrants. Some were already wanted by the police for sundry offences. Currently, there is an estimated 5050-600 Nigerians in jails scattered all over India. Over time, the Indian mindset which thrives on profiling and stereotyping has come to associate Nigerians with criminal behavior especially illegal immigration, racketeering, fraud and cultism.\n\nChina has recorded many similar incidents of criminality involving Nigerians. Unfortunately for the ugly Nigerians, China has no pretensions to liberal niceties or the finer points of human rights observances. Those who affront Chinese laws know the consequences. The Nigerian Consul in Guangzhou recently disclosed in 2018 that an estimated 600-700 Nigerians were in Chinese prisons. The current estimate is anywhere between 850 and 1000. The offences range from visa overstays to narcotics trafficking, cultism, forgery and business fraud. An estimated 1000 Nigerians are languishing in Thai prisons for similar reasons. In the United States, the Justice Department has a huge trove of Nigerians currently undergoing criminal investigation or trials for sundry offences ranging from credit card fraud to bank wire transfer and internet fraud.\n\nIn response to these developments, government at home has come under increased pressure to go out more aggressively in defense of our citizens. Critics of government have insisted that our government has displayed the same tardiness in addressing the problems of our distressed citizens abroad as in its treatment of citizens at home. But it is a truism that the image that a nation projects abroad is more a reflection of its identity and character at home. We are abroad who we are at home. But the activities of the ugly Nigerians tend to overwhelm the essential nobility of the Nigerian national identity and character.\n\nAbove narrow moral qualms, there is a new positivity about our bulging diaspora. The Nigerian diaspora has in recent years become a strategic proposition of national economic survival. Inward diaspora foreign exchange remittances has become a major source of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Nigeria and independent data sources indicate that between 2019 and 2020, inward diaspora foreign exchange remittances was in excess of an annual average of $34.5 billion. The population of the Nigerian diaspora is 1.7 million each remitting an average of $38,428.15 which comes to a total of $65.34Bn over the three up to 2020.\n\nOur oil and gas revenue was $34.22 billion in 2019.\n\nThis means that our aggregate diaspora remittances are currently at par with earnings from oil and gas. Oil and gas reserves are natural resources and fairly fixed and may not be increased or expanded at will. But the quality, productivity and size of our diaspora population can improve and increase in relation to our overall population. Apart from the Indian (17.5 million) and Chinese (10.7 million) diasporas that reflect their obvious demographic advantages over Nigeria, other countries with comparable demographics or even less, have far larger diaspora populations. Comparative diaspora figures for Mexico (11.8 million), Russia (10.5 million), Syria (8.2 million) and Bangladesh (7.6 million) speak for themselves.\n\nSince our diaspora population has become a strategic economic asset, it needs to be more consciously grown and jealously protected than our oil wells and gas fields. The diaspora is human capital. Protection of our oil and gas fields is part of our national defense and security responsibility. The actions required to protect and grow our diaspora population are a complex combination. First, Nigerians require maximum diplomatic protection wherever they may be in the world. Second, the quality of Nigerians out there can only grow if education at home improves dramatically. Perhaps President Buhari read his realization upside down when he recently crowed in Europe that Nigerians are doing so well abroad because of the sound education at home. Not quite yet Mr. President!\n\nBut the improvement of the quality of the manpower that migrates from Nigeria to the rest of the world is an aspect of social investment at home. We can only grow this asset through greater investment in education. India has done well in this regard. India is currently the leading \u201cexporter\u201d of IT executives, and IT engineers to the US and Europe. Both our annual education budget (7.2% in 2019) and overall education standards remain disgracefully low. Even worse is our competitiveness in tertiary education especially in the areas of cutting edge scientific research and innovative technologies. As a consequence, the bulk of the Nigerian diaspora consists of middle to low level manpower and an assortment of petty traders and other menial operatives. The underground activities of these low level groups aggravates the country\u2019s negative perception.\n\nWe can increase oil exploration activities, invest in better extraction technologies or expand the fields of exploration. But fossil fuels as an energy source is an endangered resource. The global race is for cleaner, cheaper alternatives energy sources. The global clamour for climate change awareness and heavy investment in cleaner and renewable energy alternatives mean that our over reliance on oil and gas is a dead end. But investment in higher quality human resources and skills is a road not yet traveled by Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s long term salvation lies in massive investment in human capital development than in dying extractive industries.\n\nYet grappling with how the Nigerian state discharges its obligations to its citizens scattered all over the world remains a burning concern. It is part of an ancient definition of the reciprocity between the sovereign state and the individual citizen. There is no escape from a proper grasp of that ancient relationship.\n\nMy nation right or wrong was the classic dictum of the golden age of Western nationalism. The emergence of the nation state as a republican entity was the ultimate repudiation of the absolutist monarchical state. In that state, the necessity of patriotism was dictated by the will of the monarch who defined what constituted patriotic conduct. But with the toppling of the monarchy and the rise of the popular democratic state, the concept of patriotism was similarly democratized. The patriotic commitment of citizens was now guaranteed by an elected sovereign with a corresponding obligation to protest every citizen equally. The unflinching loyalty of the citizenry and their faith in the nation was guaranteed by the social contract between citizen and ruler.\n\nTherefore, an unquestioning belief in the rightness of one\u2019s country in its encounters with other nations was the mark of patriotism for which people earned state honours, medals and other sovereign decorations. Underlying that belief was the assumption that the leadership of one\u2019s nation, being democratically elected, were persons who embodied the wisdom of the state as a reflection of the best wisdom and interest of the populace.\n\nCitizens were therefore presumed good ambassadors of their nations because they embodied the values of a \u2018good\u2019 nation. Between citizens and their government, there was a reciprocal goodwill which energized citizens to be ready to die for their nations while compelling governments to go all out to defend and protect their citizens wherever in the world they may be in distress. In whatever circumstance, governments acquired a bounding obligation to defend and protect their citizens when they get into trouble in other lands but within the bounds of the laws of those alien places.\n\nQuite often, the Nigerian state fails in its responsibility to its citizens in the more obvious instances where diplomatic and legal intervention can save a Nigerian life or secure a valued freedom. That is a matter more of competence and diplomatic astuteness than resources. But \u2018ugly\u2019 Nigerians who flagrantly violate the laws of the places where they go to seek livelihood cannot expect the government to turn into a multinational policeman. After all, there are less than two million Nigerians in the diaspora as against the over 200 million Nigerians living in the homeland. In apportioning attention and resources to the welfare of its citizenry at home and abroad, governments are usually guided by the same principle of proportionality in relation to resources and capacities.\n\nThe governing consideration in dealing with our good and bad citizens abroad ought to be guided by current economic considerations. Both noble and ugly Nigerians bring back good money which we desperately need to survive. It is better to adopt the attitude of the Chinese leader Deng Xiao Ping when he set out to engage the free capitalist world. He placed China\u2019s economic interest above all else and declared: \u201cIt does not matter whether it be a black cat or a white cat. If it catches mice, it is a good cat.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Wahid Enitan Oshodi recently made history as the second Nigerian to be elected vice-president of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). In this interview with TheCable\u2019s REMI SULOLA, Oshodi speaks about his electoral success, what the victory means to him, what he hopes to achieve in the new position, and his plans for improving the quality of the game in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you first decided to run for ITTF vice-president, how high did you rate your chances?\n\nThe plan to run came from promptings by a lot of people in other federations that I had interacted and worked with in the ITTF over the last few years. Our hosting and organisation of various events in Nigeria had shown that we had the needed skills to grow our sport. A lot of the African federations believed I could help at the top level and so we moved ahead with our plans.\n\nHow does your victory feel?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA bit overwhelming to be honest. We had done our homework and there was fantastic unity within our continent and this encouraged our friends across the world to support Africa\u2019s two candidates. We hoped to win but it was really heartwarming to poll the kind of numbers we did. It really was an endorsement of the work we have been doing in the sport in the last few years.\n\nWhat improvement in African table tennis do you plan to drive with your new position?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo major plans are youth development and creating top-class events across the continent. Africa has a lot of fantastic young players and we need to help them develop their skills and grow to become top players. We have been doing this for a while but this position will assist greatly in sourcing resources to assist these young boys and girls in their development. We must continue to produce top events that will attract the best players to come to Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s been a dearth of young female Nigerian players in recent years. What is the cause and how can it be rectified?\n\nThe NTTF has a lot of work to do in this regard. There are various problems militating against girls playing. We are lagging behind Egypt Algeria and a few other countries. The NTTF is working hard to fast-track the development of some young girls who we discovered in our tournaments earlier this year. There is no way around it. We must start to create more opportunities for these youngsters to play at an early age. This will help the coaches in setting out programmes for their development. The NTTF is on the right track but more funding needs to be found to do this work.\n\nNigerian-based table tennis players often complain that there aren\u2019t enough competitions to keep them at the level needed to compete with their peers around the world. What is being done to change this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are issues of funding the game locally. The federal and state governments can\u2019t fund all events, so we need to work harder in seeking alternative funding for competitions. This is the only way we can develop our own events. Funding is hard because of the economic situation but the federation must seek more partners that can help to sponsor our events and the players\u2019 training. I believe we will start to see more as the economy starts to improve.",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

We\u2019re currently prospecting those regions for opportunities to expand safely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup recently launched a revamped version of its app that allows users to buy crypto for less than $1 (\u20a6550) while offering features such as one-click limit orders and automated recurring buys.\n\nIt intends to launch a savings feature that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto next month and early next year, another for users to spend cryptocurrencies at select online and offline retail outlets. The latter is being developed in partnership with SureGifts, a gift card company.\n\nThe Busha team.

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held. If you haven\u2019t registered, you can do so here.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian fintech startup, FairMoney, hosts its first \u201cInvestor Conference\u201d",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is just above the global average of 11.7%.\n\nThe report was based on a survey conducted on 1,205 Nigerian Internet users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is the sixth country with the highest rate of NFT adoption out of the 20 countries surveyed. The top five countries were the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nSurprisingly, the US, UK, and Japan, were the bottom three. The survey also went on to estimate that Nigeria\u2019s NFT ownership rate could reach 35% as 21.7% of the surveyed Internet users, plan to own NFTs.\n\nHold on a minute. Can 1,205 Internet users out of 101.72 million tell the true story about NFTs in Nigeria?\n\nHowever, if we consider the fact that Nigeria also ranked sixth in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis maybe Finders.com\u2019s report isn\u2019t too far fetched.\n\nWhat do you think? Are Nigerians really that big on NFTs? Hit reply and let\u2019s know what you think.\n\nAsilimia\u2019s $2m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsilimia team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAfrican fintech startup, Asilimia, has raised $2 million to help African Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), digitise their operations and connect them to the formal financial economy. The funding comprises a $1 million pre-seed and $1 million in debt financing.\n\nThe round saw investment from serial entrepreneur, Fredrik Jung Abbou, Co-founder of two unicorns \u2014 Kry, a telemedicine startup and fintech startup, Lendo. Other investors include Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Bpifrance and GreenTec Capital Partners\n\nHow does Asilimia work? The startup helps MSMEs digitise and formalise their operations \u2014 payments, revenue collection, and accounting \u2014 with its digital platform while providing them with credit facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Tekwane Mwendwa and Morgane Kablan, it helps business owners track expenses, payments, and get financial insights on their mobile phones.\n\nWhile Asilimia\u2019s mission could formalise MSMEs on the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 45% were subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019 according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). That number, however, is expected to reach 50% by 2025.\n\nThe startup plans to grow its team and expand into more East African markets with the funding.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s $3.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePipe team\n\nNigerian fintech API, OnePipe, has closed a $3.5 million seed, co-led by Atlantica Ventures, Tribe Capital and V&R Associates. Other investors include Techstars, Ingressive Capital and Canaan Partners.\n\nOnePipe CEO and Founder, Ope Adeoye, told TechCrunch, that the startup offers embedded banking or banking as a service, \u201cmeaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.\u201d\n\nA little back story: Adeoye was a Senior Software Engineer at Interswitch before moving to Zain Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, he moved back to Interswitch to lead the creation of Quickteller. After eleven years at Interswitch, Adeoye built OnePipe in November 2018 to create seamless partnerships between fintechs and banks.\n\nWith this new funding, the startup has plans to expand into other African countries through a partnership with Sendy, a logistics and freight company.\n\nWant to know more about OnePipe?

          "title": "2023 elections: Nigeria back to pre-1999 era",
          "text": "This year marks 22 years since Nigeria returned to civil rule after years of military dictatorship that drained the economy, increased poverty, made people live life on the edge, rise in social unrest and forced many on voluntary exile.\n\nWhile Abdulsalami Abubakar, the then Head of State, kept to his promise of returning Nigeria to civil rule, and the people felt relieved when Olusegun Obasanjo became the president, that hope reignited in 1999 seems to be lost today as the citizenry faces situations that could be termed worse than the pre-1999 era.\n\nIf the current persisting hardship is what democracy means, many would have preferred military rule as there seems to be no sharp difference, especially with the current administration that is being accused of remaining unmoved in the face of excruciating economic pain in the polity.\n\n\u201cYes, the military generals did not respect the constitution and rule of law, they were brutal and even stole the country dry, but we did not feel the level of insecurity and poverty in the country as we do now,\u201d Fredrick Umelo, a retired civil servant, said.\n\nFor him, Nigeria is in a more precarious situation now than in the pre-1999 election era; a development, according to him, makes nonsense of the 22 years of democratic rule. He queried the conscience and truthfulness of the political elite. He accused the ruling class of plunging more Nigerians today into the abyss of poverty than was the case in 1998 before the elections in 1999.\n\nRead Also: 2023 Elections: Hitting rock bottom, finding a way up\n\n\u201cI think the military should be laughing at the selfish Nigerian politicians, who have proven that democracy cannot work in Nigeria as they have in the 22 years of democratic rule, enriched themselves at the expense of the poor masses.\n\n\u201cHas standard of living improved now? Life expectancy is declining every day; inflation is uncontrollable; unemployment is soaring like never before; killings now appear normal, yet the politicians open their mouths to talk of their achievements in power; which achievement than stashing money in Swiss Bank, pilling debt for unborn children, and directly and indirectly executing their selfish or regional agenda,\u201d the aggrieved retiree lamented.\n\nFor Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, the respite Nigerians witnessed then was real, but the situation on ground is making a mockery of that joy.\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of democratic president in 1999, the world hoped that Nigeria would learn from the long years of military rule, advance from the situation before 1999 and grow her democracy, amid dividends after every general election. But we are not there yet; we seem to start afresh and it is sad,\u201d Onikoyi, who was a university undergraduate at that time, said.\n\nSpeaking further, he noted that while he is in Brussels in Belgium on official appointment, many Nigerians are in Europe and America on self-exile because of the security situation and intimidation in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of my uncles was a member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), which forced the military to resign. Today, many who were witch-hunted by the government and its security apparatuses are on self-exile. The fact is that their brothers and friends are part of the people in government, so who is going to force the ruling class to change; nobody because many are scared to lose their lives and investments,\u201d he said further.\n\nHe also observed that the media is being gagged, while those benefiting from the central are hero-worshipping their benefactors.\n\n\u201cThe situation is simply a change of name or mode of operation, but the realities are even worse than before 1999,\u201d he concluded.\n\nDecrying the current situation in the country, Yohana Dati, a serial entrepreneur, noted that the country has drifted further below the level it was in 1999.\n\n\u201cFrom the economy, security, peaceful co-existence, corruption, nepotism to other anti-development vices, we have gone from bad in 1999 to worse today, we have moved from grace to grass and from frying pan to furnace fire,\u201d the food commodity exporter lamented.\n\n\u201cBefore 1999, NADECO, mainly from the South West, was on Sani Abacha\u2019s neck, most were in exile fighting the military junta to cede power to civilians. Sadly today, many who do not want to be intimidated by the DSS or Police are going on self-exile in the name of relocation abroad. But, ask yourself, who wants to be in this country where cattle is valued more than human lives. In the last seven years, I have been losing my relatives to herdsmen and gunmen and will lose more because the government does not care about those killed,\u201d Dati decried.\n\nConsidering that the South West enjoyed sympathy in 1999 over the annulled June 12 election, resulting in the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as president, Chijoke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker, noted that the South East may not enjoy such sympathy as many have been clamoring that the zone has been marginalised and should be allowed to produce the next president in 2023.\n\nAccording to Umelahi, who is also an Abuja-based lawyer, the body language of the present administration does not signal that and the political parties, especially the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which the South East zone has been supporting since 1999, is opening the presidential ticket to all candidates across the country, heightening the fears.\n\n\u201cSome of my learned colleagues say that the South West used NADECO to fight the military junta before 1999 and deserved to present the president then. But other zones were in the fight too, the Ogonis lost some of their illustrious sons, as well as the Igbos, Tivs, Effik among others. Today, the Igbos are fighting too, using the apparatus that they can obtain, despite some governors that are sellout. Are the killings in the East, intimidations by the security and menace of herdsmen not enough to consider them for presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, the sing song in society is that Nigeria has never had it so bad.\n\nThere is the perception that President Buhari has not done enough to unite the country; rather he has directly or indirectly fuelled ethnic division through glaring sectional policies, pronouncements and legislations which have pitched one section of the country against another.\n\nAyo Ogunjimi, a public affairs analyst, urged Nigerians to take their destiny in their own hands and make the needed change they want at the ballot.\n\n\u201cI agree the country is in a bad state, but it is up to us to vote and make that change in 2023. I think the situation now is different from 1999 where we were just returning to democracy after years of military rule, where there was not much confidence in the electoral system; in fact, a lot of people refused to vote, and some politicians avoided the transition process for fear the military would not hand it over.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the South-East would get such sympathy this time, I don\u2019t even think the ruling party would pick its presidential candidate from the region, because the party barely exists there. Maybe they have more chances in PDP, but I agree they should be allowed to rule for equity and justice sake,\u201d Ogunjimi said.\n\nSimilarly, Kunle Okunade, political commentator, said the South-East should not believe the presidency would be handed over to them on a platter of gold, stressing that they need to position themselves, strategies and lobby other interest geopolitical zones.\n\nHe added that it would be difficult for the South-East to enjoy the sympathy and political grace the South-West enjoyed in 1999 because the circumstances are different.\n\n\u201cPolitics is all struggles for political power among interests and so, no interest will want to easily relinquish power or allow power shift. That is to say, the South-East should not believe the presidency would be handed over to them on a platter of gold. They need to position themselves, strategies deeper, lobby other interest geopolitical zones, negotiate power with both centripetal and centrifugal forces in the country and push forward a unified candidate.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHowever, it might be hard for the South-East to enjoy the sympathy and political grace the South-West enjoyed in 1999 because the circumstances are different. The political drama of the pre and post 1993 era was part of what paved the way for a South-West president in 1999. It was never as a result of any marginalisation as it is with the South-East.\n\n\u201cOn whether the 2023 general election would be fair as in 1993, this can\u2019t be given an exact answer because candidates of the political parties truly emerged from the party not imposed on the party because of money. Unlike what we have right now, where the provisions in the Electoral Acts are not duly followed.\n\n\u201cWhat I know is that the fairest of elections in this contemporary would be determined by how effective and efficient the provisions of the Electoral Act are followed by all stakeholders.\u201d",

          "title": "Should you be worried about Omicron, new covid variant?",
          "text": "Should you be worried about Omicron, new covid variant?\n\nThe new Omicron coronavirus variant \u2013 identified first in South Africa, but also detected in Europe and Asia \u2013 is raising concern worldwide given the number of mutations, which might help it spread or even evade antibodies from prior infection or vaccination.\n\nNews of the variant prompted countries to announce new travel restrictions on Friday and sent drug makers scrambling to see if their COVID-19 vaccines remain protective. These countries introducing ban on flights include the UK which said Saturday that two cases of Omicron have been found there. Even African countries are now banning flights from South Africa.\n\nWHY ARE SCIENTISTS WORRIED?\n\nThe World Health Organization on Friday classified the B.1.1.529 variant, or Omicron, as a SARS-CoV-2 \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d saying it may spread more quickly than other forms of coronavirus.\n\nThe Delta variant remains dominant worldwide, accounting for 99.9% of U.S. cases, and it is not yet clear whether Omicron will be able to displace Delta, said Dr. Graham Snyder, medical director, infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nBut the new variant has over 30 mutations in the part of the virus that current vaccines target. It is also suspected of driving a spike in new infections in South Africa.\n\nOmicron\u2019s mutations are likely to render certain COVID-19 treatments \u2013 including some manufactured antibodies \u2013 ineffective, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University.\n\nExperimental antiviral pills \u2013 such as Pfizer Inc\u2019s (PFE.N) Paxlovid and Merck & Co Inc\u2019s (MRK.N) molnupiravir \u2013 target parts of the virus that are not changed in Omicron, and these drugs could become even more important if vaccine-induced and natural immunity are threatened.\n\nTHE UNKNOWNS\n\nScientists say it could be several more weeks before they can define the type of disease caused by the variant, determine how contagious it is and identify how far it has already spread.\n\nSome note that other variants of concern, including Beta, which was also first detected in South Africa, were ultimately replaced by Delta.\n\nBut the biggest question remains whether protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 nearly 8 billion doses have been administered globally \u2013 will hold up. And, will people previously infected with the coronavirus be immune from infection with Omicron?\n\nExperts also don\u2019t yet know whether Omicron will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other coronavirus strains.\n\nBEST RESPONSE?\n\nOmicron has not yet been identified in the United States, but it is likely already here, scientists said.\n\nEven without the new variant, U.S. COVID-19 rates have increased in recent weeks, mainly in northern states, as people move indoors to avoid winter weather.\n\nSome countries have moved to limit travel from southern Africa. Beyond government restrictions, individuals should still assess their own vulnerability to COVID and tolerance for risk as they make travel decisions for the winter holidays, Snyder from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said.\n\nHe and others said vaccination should remain a priority despite questions about effectiveness against Omicron, because it is likely that they still remain protective to a certain extent. Everyone should also continue to wear masks, avoid crowds, ventilate rooms, and wash hands.\n\n\u201cWe have all those tools that will work against any variant,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.",
          "summary": "Should you be worried about Omicron, new covid variant?\nNews of the variant prompted countries to announce new travel restrictions on Friday and sent drug makers scrambling to see if their COVID-19 vaccines remain protective.\nThese countries introducing ban on flights include the UK which said Saturday that two cases of Omicron have been found there.\nThe World Health Organization on Friday classified the B.1.1.529 variant, or Omicron, as a SARS-CoV-2 \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d saying it may spread more quickly than other forms of coronavirus.\nBut the biggest question remains whether protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 nearly 8 billion doses have been administered globally \u2013 will hold up.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe two modular refineries in Edo State have the capacity to end the importation of petroleum products in South-South region of Nigeria. The two modular refineries will end fuel subsidy in the South-South region of Nigeria. They will start operation very soon. We are expecting President Buhari to commission them very soon. Edo Modular Energy refinery is set to increase crude oil production from 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd. The project will enhance fuel sufficiency in the country and reduce the sufferings of Nigerians in every facet. Projections are that some of its products will be exported to boost foreign exchange earnings and by the time it extends operations into different phases, the firm would be able to take care of more than 80 per cent of diesel requirement in Nigeria. The investment is also expected to benefit Edo people through job creation, increased revenue and ease of pressure on other refineries.\n\nThe continuation of subsidising of petrol is not sustainable in the light of current economic realities. The 2022 deadline is realistic and its impact might be mitigated with the coming on stream of the Modular Refineries project at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state and Dupot Oil Modular Refinery, Egbokor Village, Iyoba Ward, Orhionmwon Local Government, Edo State, 650,000BPD Dangote Refinery, Bua Group Refinery, Waltersmith Refinery and other modular refineries. The modular refineries in Edo State are capable of eliminating petrol subsidy in the South-South region of Nigeria. President Buhari should allow these refineries to come on stream before the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nThe removal of petrol subsidy is in the interest of development of the downstream sector. The decision of the government to stop subsidising petrol by 2022 and it will attract more investments to the sector, especially with the passage of PIA. I want a level playing field to be provided for everyone in the sector to encourage competition once the subsidy is removed.\n\nGovernor Obaseki and two modular refineries will drive industrial revolution in Edo State. The petroleum industry in Edo State received a new boost as the Federal Government reduced the cost of obtaining a refinery license from $1,000,000(one million dollars) to $150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand dollars) among other things. The ongoing Modular Refineries project at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state and Dupot Oil Modular Refinery, Egbokor Village, Iyoba Ward, Orhionmwon Local Government, Edo State will on completion, drive the state\u2019s industrial revolution quest.\n\nIn the last 5 years in Edo State, production capacity of PSC\u2019s has steadily increased, averaging 3% growth, to account for about 35% of total production. JV arrangements contributed about 55% of aggregate production in the preceding year. Indigenous Oil Companies\u2019 production capacity accounts for about one-eighth of aggregate production. The depletion and reserves replacement rate y-o-y averaged 2.04% and 4.00% respectively. Currently, the reserves life index stands at about 49.03 years. Edo is one of the lucky states to be an oil producing state. This state contributes 2.06% of the total crude oil output in the country. Benin City is currently the capital of Edo and the state has a human strength of more than 3.3 million spread across the state\u2019s Local Government Areas.\n\nDupot Oil Modular Refinery, Egbokor Village, Iyoba Ward, Orhionmwon Local Government ,Edo Modular and Refinery Company Ltd. and AIPCC Energy, were on the verge of completing the 5,500bpd Edo Modular Refinery, now at 70 per cent completion stage.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Edo Modular Energy refinery is set to increase crude oil production from 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd. The project is being developed by two Chinese firms; AIPCC Energy Limited and the Peiyang Chemical Equipment Company Limited.\n\nOperations are expected to commence between mid-October and december. The first phase will produce 1,000 bpd, while the second phase will produce 6,000 bpd; with a long-term goal of producing 60,000 bpd. Phase one \u2013 which is completed \u2013 will target a production ratio comprising 55% diesel, 38% fuel oil and less than 10% naphtha. \u201cSome of the products will be exported to boost foreign exchange earnings and by the time we extend it into different phases. We would be able to take care of more than 80% of diesel requirement in Nigeria. That is the vision we have for the next five years,\u201d says Segun Okeni \u2013 AIPCC Energy Limited Head of Quality, Health and Safety/Community Relations.\n\nThe investment will benefit the Edo people through job creation, increased revenue and ease of pressure on other refineries. This is a key legacy project by the Gov. Godwin Obaseki-led administration to recalibrate the state\u2019s industrial base, birthed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).\n\nThe project, sited at Ologbo in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area, would produce from its feedstock 50 per cent of diesel (500,000 litres), 25 per cent of naphtha (300,000 litres) and 20 per cent of fuel oil (200,000) litres. The crude is to be sourced from the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company\u2019s (NPDC) facility \u2013 oil mining lease (OML) 111, near Benin City.\n\nThe modular refineries project were among the growing list of ongoing legacy projects of Governor Obaseki through MoU with local and international private investors, which included the 55MW CCTEC Ossiomo Power Plant, which had been completed and ready for use. The Benin Enterprise and Industrial Park, which development is ongoing and the Benin River Port, for which preliminary works are ongoing,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Obaseki is committed to resetting the economy of the state for prosperity and industrial growth. According to Obaseki, the local content component of the refinery project ensures that Edo citizens are trained in welding, refinery operation and fabrication works to enable them participate in the construction of the refinery as well as its operation, post-commissioning.\n\nA modular refinery is a prefabricated crude oil processing plant constructed on skid mounted surfaces, with each structure containing a portion of the entire refining process plant, with by interstitial piping to form an easily manageable process. Technically, a modular refinery could be either simple or complex, with capacity ranging from 100 bpsd to 10,000 bpsd. They are however not defined by size. They can be transported in modules across distances and put together at the location desired. The other advantages of modular refineries include short project completion time, relatively small overall project cost, provides quicker investment return, can be installed in small space and could be designed towards petroleum product need around its location.\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Ologbo, Edo State\n\n...",

He also added that none of the aspirants is his anointed yet.\n\nHon. Adagunodo also assured that PDP will win in Ekiti, Osun, the entire South West and also win the presidential election in 2022 and 2023 and beyond because the present APC regime has failed Nigerians in all sectors, economy, education, infrastructure and virtually in every aspects imaginable.",

Is it because Ken Saro-Wiwa preached that we should adopt non-violent approach? That is why they (government) are treating Ogoni people the way they like.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. This is the right time they will know that Ogoni people are angry. That office must be occupied by an Ogoni person. Without that, nobody will sit in that position.\u201d\n\nHe warned politicians to desist from planting surrogates that would do their biddings to head the agency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso speaking, Solomon Lenu said there were Ogoni natives with competent qualities to be appointed project coordinators of HYPREP, adding that it would be morally wrong to appoint someone who was a staff member of Shell and anti-Ogoni to head an agency handling the people\u2019s affairs.\n\nLenu said: \u201cThat Philip Shekwolo is a Shell surrogate who in the past defended Shell that there was no oil spill in Ogoniland, that if there was any, it was the orchestration of Ogonis themselves to blackmail Shell.\n\n\u201cOgoni youths and elders say capital No to Philip Shekwolo as substantive HYPREP coordinator. That Ogoni people have sons and daughters who are more than qualified to pilot the affairs of HYPREP as coordinators.\n\n\u201cWe are equally ready to sacrifice everything legally and otherwise available to us to ensure we stop this sacrilegious appetite of Shekwolo.\u201d",

Is it because Ken Saro-Wiwa preached that we should adopt non-violent approach? That is why they (government) are treating Ogoni people the way they like.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. This is the right time they will know that Ogoni people are angry. That office must be occupied by an Ogoni person. Without that, nobody will sit in that position.\u201d\n\nHe warned politicians to desist from planting surrogates that would do their biddings to head the agency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso speaking, Solomon Lenu said there were Ogoni natives with competent qualities to be appointed project coordinators of HYPREP, adding that it would be morally wrong to appoint someone who was a staff member of Shell and anti-Ogoni to head an agency handling the people\u2019s affairs.\n\nLenu said: \u201cThat Philip Shekwolo is a Shell surrogate who in the past defended Shell that there was no oil spill in Ogoniland, that if there was any, it was the orchestration of Ogonis themselves to blackmail Shell.\n\n\u201cOgoni youths and elders say capital No to Philip Shekwolo as substantive HYPREP coordinator. That Ogoni people have sons and daughters who are more than qualified to pilot the affairs of HYPREP as coordinators.\n\n\u201cWe are equally ready to sacrifice everything legally and otherwise available to us to ensure we stop this sacrilegious appetite of Shekwolo.\u201d",

          "title": "$3.48bn loan: Nigeria risks losing assets to China, experts warn FG",
          "text": "Economic and financial experts have warned the Federal Government that Nigeria risks losing key national assets to China in the event that it defaults in paying back loans obtained from China which is currently put at $3.48bn.\n\nThey spoke against the backdrop of the possible takeover of Uganda\u2019s only international airport and other key assets over the East African country\u2019s inability to repay a $207m loan obtained on November 17, 2015 from the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\nThe loan has a maturity period of 20 years including a seven-year grace period. According to the deal signed with the Chinese lenders, Uganda will have to surrender its only international airport.\n\nThe Uganda Civil Aviation Authority said some provisions of the financing agreement with China exposed the Entebbe International Airport and other Ugandan assets which might be taken over by Chinese lenders upon arbitration in Beijing.\n\nChina has reportedly rejected recent pleas by Uganda to renegotiate the toxic clauses of the 2015 loan.\n\nThis came as Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, in August 2020 hinted about the possibility of Nigeria forfeiting its assets to China in the event of loan default.\n\nAmaechi reportedly said Nigeria had waived immunity on a loan, which means China could take the country to arbitration in the event of a default.\n\nThe minister, however, added that there would be no need for China to claim any infrastructure once Nigeria repaid its loans to the Asian country.\n\n\u201cWe must learn to pay our debts and we are paying, and once you are paying, nobody will come and take any of your assets,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nHowever, financial analysts hinted about the possibility of Nigeria forfeiting key national assets to China if the country defaulted on its $3.48bn loans.\n\nThey also advised the Federal Government to properly review the loan agreements with China to save the country from facing a situation similar to that of Uganda.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of SD&D Capital Management, Idakolo Gbolade, said Nigeria might forfeit certain assets in the event of a loan default.\n\nAsked if Nigeria faced any risks on its China loans, Gbolade said, \u201cYes, it is very possible. If you remember about a year ago, there was serious concern in the National Assembly on the loans given by the Chinese Exim Bank to us, and I am sure the loan clause also includes forfeiture of national assets.\u201d\n\nThe expert, however, expressed confidence that Nigeria was capable of paying back its debt.\n\nAn economist and professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akpan Ekpo, said the development in Uganda was worrisome and exemplified some of the dangers of borrowing from external sources.\n\nHe, therefore, advised the government to ensure that loan agreements with China were properly appraised.\n\nEkpo said, \u201cIt is an issue of concern; that is why in any loan agreement with China, we have to read in between the lines. We have to make sure we really understand their agreements.\n\n\u201cWe should make sure that Nigerians are involved in the loan negotiation process. Experts should be carried along so that they can properly understand both the agreement in English and in Chinese.\n\n\u201cIf the loans have clauses that may cost us our assets or even our sovereignty \u2013 as the debate was earlier in the year \u2013 that would be disastrous.\n\n\u201cSo they should take experts with them when they go to negotiate the loans they collect from China, not just people from foreign affairs.\u201d\n\nA professor of Economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ogun State, Sheriffdeen Tella, equally expressed a similar view, stressing that all loan agreements between Nigeria and external sources should be properly studied by experts.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt could happen to any African country because they are all thinking of borrowing. But I think that since people have kept the conversation alive now, the government will be very careful with loans collected from China.\n\n\u201cThere is, however, the need for an assessment of government external debt from different sources now. We have to start looking at it and there is a need to study the documents that contain the agreements of some of these loans to prevent a similar occurrence.\n\n\u201cWe need to start asking \u2018what are the contents or the conditions of the loans?\u2019 There is also a need for the government to create a means for offsetting such debts.\u201d\n\nThe Managing Director of Cowry Asset Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, said the country should not have a problem paying back the loan if the economy thrived sufficiently.\n\nHe said, \u201cAn interest of 2.5 per cent is not high. The key challenge is that did we invest the money in productive assets, and are we getting the value for the money? Was the project cost-optimal?\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that investment in infrastructure should lead to an expansion in the country\u2019s ability to generate revenue. If the economy thrives, paying back the loan should not be a problem.\n\n\u201cHowever, if certain reasonable conditions are not met, it may have a catalytic effect on the economy with the country finding it difficult to pay back the loan.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Federal Government has been mostly secretive about the terms of the agreement of its China loans, the Debt Management Office has made some statements on them in recent times.\n\nIn a statement in June, 2020, the DMO said, \u201cThe total borrowings from China of $3.121bn as at March 31, 2020, are concessional loans with interest rates of 2.5 per cent per annum, tenor of 20 years and grace period (moratorium) of seven years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the DMO, the terms are compliant with the provisions of Section 41 (1a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007.\n\nIn addition, the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to government while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years.\n\nEleven projects, ranging from water supply, power generation, railways, airport terminals, communication to agricultural processing are funded by the loans acquired.\n\nThe Director-General, DMO, Patience Oniha, had in February said, \u201cSo far, let\u2019s be very clear that there has not been any default, whether of local or international debt.\u201d\n\nThe earliest of the funding agreements between Nigeria and China was signed in 2010 with an interest rate of 2.5 per cent yearly, a repayment period of about 20 years and a grace period of seven years.\n\nIf Nigeria is unable to pay its first debt by 2038, the country may have to lease out any of the Chinese-funded projects in Nigeria to China.\n\nThe first loan project was for the Nigerian national public security communication system project with $399.50m agreed on December 20, 2010 and disbursed.\n\nThe second loan was for the Nigerian railway modernisation project (Wu- Kaduna section) with $500m agreed on December 20, 2010 and disbursed.\n\nWhile the third loan was for the Abuja light rail project with $500m agreed on November 7, 2012 and disbursed, the fourth loan was targeted at Nigerian ICT infrastructure backbone project with $100m agreed on January 5, 2013 and disbursed.\n\nThe fifth loan was meant for the Nigerian four airport terminals\u2019 expansion project (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt) with $500m agreed on July 10, 2013 but $455.28m was disbursed, which is 91.06 per cent of the agreed amount.\n\nThe sixth loan was for the Nigerian Zungeru hydroelectric power project with $984.32m agreed on September 28, 2013 but only $518.24m was disbursed, which is 52.65 per cent of the agreed amount.\n\nThe seventh loan was for the Nigerian 40 parboiled rice processing plants project (Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development), with $325.67m agreed on April 26, 2016, but nothing was disbursed.\n\nThe eighth loan was for the Nigerian railway modernisation project (Lagos \u2013 Ibadan section), with $1.27bn agreed on August 18, 2017 but only $759.84m was disbursed, which is 17.50 per cent of the agreed amount.\n\nThe ninth loan was targeted at the rehabilitation and upgrading of Abuja-Keffi-Markurdi road project with $460.82m agreed on August 18, 2017 but only $80.64m was disbursed, which is 59.96 per cent of the amount agreed.\n\nThe 10th loan was meant for the Nigeria supply of rolling stocks and depot equipment for the Abuja light rail project with $157m agreed on May 29, 2018, but nothing was disbursed.\n\nLastly, the 11th loan was for the Nigeria greater Abuja water supply project with $381.09m agreed on May 29, 2018, but nothing was disbursed.\n\nIn terms of repayments, Nigeria paid $102.68m to China in the first six month of 2021, while it still owes about $3.48bn\n\nNigeria also paid a total of $102.68m to the Exim Bank of China in the first half of this year.\n\nNigeria paid an interest fee of $42.54m, which is 73.76 per cent of the principal fee of $57.67m as debt service to the Exim Bank of China in the first three months of 2021\n\nAlongside commitment charges of $1.98m, Nigeria paid a total of $102.20m.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, Nigeria paid an interest fee of $306,050, without paying the principal fee, as debt service to the Exim Bank of China in the second three months of 2021\n\nAlongside commitment charges of $170,680, Nigeria paid a total of $476,730 in Q2 2021.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Nigeria spent $591.11m in five years on servicing the debts owed to the Exim Bank of China.\n\nNevertheless, Nigeria still owes China $3.48bn as of the end of June 2021.

If the economy thrives, paying back the loan should not be a problem.\n\n\u201cHowever, if certain reasonable conditions are not met, it may have a catalytic effect on the economy with the country finding it difficult to pay back the loan.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Federal Government has been mostly secretive about the terms of the agreement of its China loans, the Debt Management Office has made some statements on them in recent times.\n\nIn a statement in June, 2020, the DMO said, \u201cThe total borrowings from China of $3.121bn as at March 31, 2020, are concessional loans with interest rates of 2.5 per cent per annum, tenor of 20 years and grace period (moratorium) of seven years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the DMO, the terms are compliant with the provisions of Section 41 (1a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007.\n\nIn addition, the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to government while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years.\n\nEleven projects, ranging from water supply, power generation, railways, airport terminals, communication to agricultural processing are funded by the loans acquired.\n\nThe Director-General, DMO, Patience Oniha, had in February said, \u201cSo far, let\u2019s be very clear that there has not been any default, whether of local or international debt.\u201d\n\nThe earliest of the funding agreements between Nigeria and China was signed in 2010 with an interest rate of 2.5 per cent yearly, a repayment period of about 20 years and a grace period of seven years.\n\nIf Nigeria is unable to pay its first debt by 2038, the country may have to lease out any of the Chinese-funded projects in Nigeria to China.\n\nThe first loan project was for the Nigerian national public security communication system project with $399.50m agreed on December 20, 2010 and disbursed.\n\nThe second loan was for the Nigerian railway modernisation project (Wu- Kaduna section) with $500m agreed on December 20, 2010 and disbursed.\n\nWhile the third loan was for the Abuja light rail project with $500m agreed on November 7, 2012 and disbursed, the fourth loan was targeted at Nigerian ICT infrastructure backbone project with $100m agreed on January 5, 2013 and disbursed.\n\nThe fifth loan was meant for the Nigerian four airport terminals\u2019 expansion project (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt) with $500m agreed on July 10, 2013 but $455.28m was disbursed, which is 91.06 per cent of the agreed amount.\n\nThe sixth loan was for the Nigerian Zungeru hydroelectric power project with $984.32m agreed on September 28, 2013 but only $518.24m was disbursed, which is 52.65 per cent of the agreed amount.\n\nThe seventh loan was for the Nigerian 40 parboiled rice processing plants project (Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development), with $325.67m agreed on April 26, 2016, but nothing was disbursed.\n\nThe eighth loan was for the Nigerian railway modernisation project (Lagos \u2013 Ibadan section), with $1.27bn agreed on August 18, 2017 but only $759.84m was disbursed, which is 17.50 per cent of the agreed amount.\n\nThe ninth loan was targeted at the rehabilitation and upgrading of Abuja-Keffi-Markurdi road project with $460.82m agreed on August 18, 2017 but only $80.64m was disbursed, which is 59.96 per cent of the amount agreed.\n\nThe 10th loan was meant for the Nigeria supply of rolling stocks and depot equipment for the Abuja light rail project with $157m agreed on May 29, 2018, but nothing was disbursed.\n\nLastly, the 11th loan was for the Nigeria greater Abuja water supply project with $381.09m agreed on May 29, 2018, but nothing was disbursed.\n\nIn terms of repayments, Nigeria paid $102.68m to China in the first six month of 2021, while it still owes about $3.48bn\n\nNigeria also paid a total of $102.68m to the Exim Bank of China in the first half of this year.\n\nNigeria paid an interest fee of $42.54m, which is 73.76 per cent of the principal fee of $57.67m as debt service to the Exim Bank of China in the first three months of 2021\n\nAlongside commitment charges of $1.98m, Nigeria paid a total of $102.20m.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, Nigeria paid an interest fee of $306,050, without paying the principal fee, as debt service to the Exim Bank of China in the second three months of 2021\n\nAlongside commitment charges of $170,680, Nigeria paid a total of $476,730 in Q2 2021.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Nigeria spent $591.11m in five years on servicing the debts owed to the Exim Bank of China.\n\nNevertheless, Nigeria still owes China $3.48bn as of the end of June 2021.

          "summary": "Economic and financial experts have warned the Federal Government that Nigeria risks losing key national assets to China in the event that it defaults in paying back loans obtained from China which is currently put at $3.48bn.\nThis came as Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, in August 2020 hinted about the possibility of Nigeria forfeiting its assets to China in the event of loan default.\nHowever, financial analysts hinted about the possibility of Nigeria forfeiting key national assets to China if the country defaulted on its $3.48bn loans.\nAsked if Nigeria faced any risks on its China loans, Gbolade said, \u201cYes, it is very possible.\nThe first loan project was for the Nigerian national public security communication system project with $399.50m agreed on December 20, 2010 and disbursed.",

Theophilus Danjuma, rtd. (Doctor of Letters); former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun (Doctor of Science); a reproductive health expert, Dr. Natalia Kanen (Doctor of Science); a legal luminary, Mr. Oluwakemi Pinheiro, SAN (Doctor of Law); and a software engineer, Dr. Thomas Ilube (Doctor of Science).\n\nBuhari said: \u201cUniversities over the years have expanded the horizon of our youths through research and technological breakthroughs to attain relevant skills and be more entrepreneurial in outlook. We must commend them for putting up the onerous task of redirecting our students on the path of moral rectitude, love for the nation, and respect for constituted authorities.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has not relented in finding lasting solutions to the myriad of challenges facing our universities and the nation\u2019s education sector. The Federal Government is aware of the deficit in funding and infrastructure. Concerted efforts are being made to improve the current condition.\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative that universities should come to terms with the present realities, including the challenge of inadequate funding. While the government will continue to ensure the full implementation of the budgetary provision to the education sub-sector, universities must also evolve other ways of augmenting what they receive as allocations and grants.\n\n\u201cAt a time like this, when the Federal Government is grappling with socioeconomic and political challenges, it is important that I reiterate its commitment to finding home-grown solutions that will outlive even my administration. We have so far diversified the economy, with focus on agriculture, through the provision of grants and start-up loans for interested individuals, especially our teeming youths.\u201d\n\nThe President also urged university administrators, in the discharge of their duties, to be transparent, accountable, and fair in the management of human and material resources, while stressing that expectedly, the education sub-sector should be at the vanguard in the campaign to reorder the nation\u2019s values.\n\nEdo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, in his remarks, stated that with his administration\u2019s 30-year development plan, the state would be transformed into Nigeria\u2019s education hub.\n\nObaseki, who was accompanied by his wife, Betsy, assured that his administration would continue to support public and private tertiary institutions in Edo state, in order to ensure human capital development and to move the Southsouth state and Nigeria forward.\n\nThe newly-installed tenth substantive Chancellor of UNIBEN, Prof. James Ortese Lorzua Ayatse, the Tor Tiv in his address, stated that President Buhari was committed to the establishment of worthy and enduring legacies for Nigeria.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari expressed his displeasure Wednesday with Nigeria\u2019s persistent reliance on imported food and raw materials, despite the country\u2019s enormous resources and knowledge.\n\nBuhari also urged Nigerian institutions to step up their efforts to produce the COVID-19 vaccine in order to combat the country\u2019s deadly illness.\n\nHe made these remarks at the convocations of the Federal University, Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State and Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike (MOUAU), Abia State.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Mohammed Abubakar at MOUAU, said the agricultural sector, apart from helping the nation to attain food security, \u201cremains the major driver in industrial development and diversification from heavy dependence on non-renewable mineral oil.\u201d\n\nThe president added that the expectation of his government was for the universities of agriculture \u201cto drive the rapid development of the knowledge and skills (needed) to increase local production of food and raw materials\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can and should be able to feed ourselves on the rich soils and diverse ecologies that God has endowed Nigeria with. We should be determined to wisely exploit the natural resources and inheritance of our nation to feed our people and possibly export to other nations.\n\n\u201cGovernment expects that universities of agriculture should bravely confront the heavy dependence of our nation on imported food and raw materials with the view to reducing it to the barest minimum at the shortest possible time,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nBuhari, also the Visitor to MOUAU, said that the agricultural policy of his administration was focused on achieving a sustainable green economy.\n\nBut he emphasised that the universities of agriculture \u201cmust play their crucial specialised role in catalysing the development of the agricultural sector\u201d to achieve the government\u2019s stated goal.\n\nBuhari promised that efforts were being made by his government \u201cto put in place policies and programmes to strengthen agencies and parastatals to provide the enabling environment for increased production\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo this end, NALDA has been re-constituted and re-established to promote mechanised agriculture,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cGovernment expects that specialised Universities of Agriculture will collaborate with NALDA to ensure increased local production of food\u201d.\n\nAbia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, in his remarks, commended MOUAU for its immense records of achievements in manpower training, research, and innovation since its inception.\n\nIkpeazu, represented by his deputy, Sir Ude Chukwu, said the abrogation of some courses that were hitherto part of the academic programmes of MOUAU has adversely affected the chances of Abia youths hungry for university education.\n\nEarlier in his address, the Vice-chancellor of MOUAU, Prof. Maduebibisi Iwe, said 5,817 graduands were found worthy to be awarded first degree certificates of the institution with 92 graduating with first class.\n\nAt Federal University, Dutsin-Ma, Buhari admonished Nigerian universities to intensify their researches to develop a COVID-19 vaccine to tackle the dreaded virus afflicting the country.\n\nHe explained that Nigerian universities were supposed to be centres for scientific and technological discoveries, inventions, values, and character formation as well as drivers of societal development.\n\nThe president who disclosed this yesterday in Katsina during the 5th and 6th combined convocation of the Federal University, Dutsin-Ma, said the development of the vaccine would fortify Nigerians\u2019 immune system against the virus.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the Minister of State for Education, Mr. Chukwuemaka Nwajiuba, noted that his administration remained committed to tackling the challenges of sustainable funding for research, capacity building, and employment creation.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou all know that in the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began its devastating effect on the education sub-sectors leading to the destruction of university academic activities.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, urged the universities to intensify their researches \u201cto come up with a more potent vaccine to fortify our immune system against this dreaded virus\u201d.\n\nBuhari also tasked the universities to explore available opportunities, including research collaboration with allied industries and development partners to create other sources of revenue generation to support his economic diversification drive.\n\nHe, however, said the federal government was committed and determined to combat and defeat all acts of criminality across the country for meaningful development to thrive.\n\n\u201cOur security is a collective responsibility, we must join hand with the government by providing security agents with useful information to enable proactive mitigation of any of these occurrences\u201d, he added.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Armaya\u2019u Hamisu Bichi, urged the federal government to dig trenches around the main campus of the institution because of the current security challenges in the country.\n\nHe said the university had graduated 1,201 students with 56 as holders of first-class, 92 postgraduates, one Ph.D., 24 masters students, 19 professional diplomas, and 48 PGD in different academic programmes.",

          "text": "\n\nThe latest COVID-19 variant identified in South Africa has been given the Greek name \u2018Omicron\u2019, and labeled as a variant of concern by UN health agency experts due to its large number of mutations and possible faster rate of infection.\n\nAccording to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), preliminary evidence also suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant of concern, as compared to other strains, such as Delta.\n\nCurrently the number of cases appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa. WHO explains that the variant has been detected at faster rates than in previous surges in infection, suggesting it \u201cmay have a growth advantage\u201d.\n\nThe experts have asked countries to enhance surveillance and genome sequencing efforts to better understand the variant.\n\nThere are also a number of studies underway and the agency\u2019s technical advisory group, known by the acronym TAG-VE, will continue to evaluate this variant. WHO will communicate new findings to Member States and to the public as needed.\n\nOn Wednesday, WHO\u2019s COVID-19 technical lead, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, said the information about the now \u2018Omicron\u2019 variant is still limited.\n\n\u201cThere are fewer than 100 whole genome sequences that are available, we don\u2019t know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations, and the concern is that when you have so many mutations it can have an impact on how the virus behaves\u201d, she said during a Q&A on Twitter.\n\nDr. Van Kerkhove explained that researchers are currently trying to determine where the mutations are and what they potentially mean for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt will take a few weeks for us to understand what impact this variant has, there\u2019s a lot of work that is underway\u201d, she added.\n\nEarlier today, the UN health agency urged all countries to adopt a risk-based and scientific approach to travel bans linked to the new variant identified in South Africa and Botswana.\n\nMr. Van Kerkhove thanked researchers from these countries for openly sharing information to the UN health agency.\n\n\u201cEveryone out there: do not discriminate against countries that share their findings openly\u201d, she urged, as countries such as Britain, France and Israel have moved to cancel direct flights from South Africa and surrounding nations.\n\nAccording to South African health authorities so far, fewer than 100 cases of the new variant have been confirmed, largely among young people who have the lowest vaccination rate in the country.\n\n\u201cCountries can do a lot already in terms of surveillance and sequencing and work together with the affected countries or globally and scientifically to fight this variant and understand more about it so that we know how to go about\u2026so at this point implementing travel measures is being cautioned against\u201d, WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told journalists in Geneva.",

          "text": "Nigerian celebrities have recently opened up publicly about the sexism they have faced after multi-award winning singer Simi spearheaded the #NobodyLikeWoman trend on Instagram.\n\nIt provided a safe space for stars, and other women, to share their experiences of discrimination.\n\nThey tended to post black-and-white photos of themselves, scrawled over with the words of their critics, like: \u201cShe\u2019s a mother, she should stay at home\u201d, \u201cWhy is she going out at night if she\u2019s not a prostitute?\u201d and \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married yet?\u201d\n\nSimi told the BBC she cried as she scrolled past one of the hash-tagged posts on her social media feed.\n\nIt was about a woman who had been mocked for having four Caesarean sections \u2013 when a baby is delivered by making a surgical cut into the abdomen and womb.\n\nPeople questioned why she could not give birth naturally.\n\nShe said the comments were harsh: \u201c\u2018She\u2019s not any good. Imagine she cannot even have your children naturally. They had to do C-section for her and she still lost one of her children.\u2019 That is so traumatising.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old singer said she wanted to start the campaign so women would understand they were \u201cnot alone\u201d in their struggles \u2013 it coincided with the release of her new song Woman.\n\nBut the flood of women who jumped on the hashtag to share their experiences of sexism and discrimination both in their careers and personal lives was a surprise.\n\nA photo of Simi with the words: \u201cHow can she ask for that kind of money, is she not pregnant?\u201d painted on her back started it all rolling.\n\nAs a famous artist in Africa and beyond, Simi said it summed up the sexism she had faced within her own industry of Afro music.\n\nAt the start of her career music bosses \u2013 usually men \u2013 told her she had to be \u201csexy\u201d and provocative to make it in her field.\n\nShe ignored them.\n\nWhen she made it big anyway, they were shocked.\n\nThere were even people who did not want to work with women, because they thought they could not function after having children or getting married, she said.\n\nIn one incident she recalled how someone questioned why she charged so much for concert tickets while she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cIt was probably an agency,\u201d she said, when asked who the culprit was.\n\nNollywood actress Chioma Omeruah \u2013 famously known as Chigul \u2013 has witnessed similar struggles and believes the problem is cultural.\n\n\u201cOur culture is not to speak out,\u201d the 45-year-old star told the BBC.\n\nShe took part in #NobodyLikeWoman with a photo along with the caption: \u201cMy friend! Go and have a child.\u201d\n\nChigul does not have any children, but that has not stopped friends and even trolls asking when she is going to have a baby.\n\nThose close to her may have meant well, but it still hurt, she said.\n\nDuring her career, Chigul said she has had countless numbers of up-and-coming actresses confide in her about alleged sexual misbehaviour by powerful male film bosses.\n\nSome of them were told by the male directors: \u201cCome and sleep with me, I\u2019ll make you a star. I can get you that part, that role\u201d \u2013 which she says amounts to coercion.\n\nOne actress she knows who refused to engage in sexual relations with a male film boss was reprimanded, she said.\n\nHe called her a \u201cchild\u201d with little understanding of \u201cadult\u201d business.\n\nWhen asked how many young actresses had confided in her about sexual coercion, she said it was \u201ctoo many\u201d.\n\nThe odds were stacked against women \u2013 the majority of the time they became the victims, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just wahala [trouble] on every level,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Chigul and Simi agree that the laws in Nigeria need to be tougher on those who discriminate against or attack women.\n\nAccording to UN Women, Nigeria has implemented 75% of laws needed to advance gender equality \u2013 which the UN wants to achieve worldwide by 2030.\n\nBut less than half the measures needed to monitor the country\u2019s progress towards that goal were in place by last year \u2013 for example the collection of regular statistics on things like the gender pay gap and physical and sexual harassment.\n\nNigerian women\u2019s rights lawyer and YouTube vlogger Sotonye Kelechi-Nwuzi says religion is often to blame.\n\nIn her opinion, Nigeran lawmakers tend to take into account how different faith communities will react to gender equality legislation.\n\nMrs Kelechi-Nwuzi, who is a Christian herself, says this is problematic.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a way to separate secular society from religious and cultural society I feel like there will be some progress,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\nThe \u201cMeToo\u201d movement went viral in 2017 and encouraged people to share experiences of sexual harassment and assault\n\nShe also places some of the blame at the feet of the Nigerian police.\n\nMost of the cases Mrs Kelechi-Nwuzi covers as part of her women\u2019s rights work involve domestic violence, which the authorities do not take seriously, she says.\n\n\u201cOften times you\u2019ll find people quoting the Bible\u201d in an attempt to justify a husband\u2019s violence towards his wife, she says.\n\n#NobodyLikeWoman posts tend to be tame compared to the #MeToo movement which swept the world a few years ago when women \u2013 especially in Hollywood \u2013 started naming those who had allegedly sexually abused them.\n\nMrs Kelechi-Nwuzi says there could be a #MeToo movement in Nigeria one day, but it would require a woman to lead it who could withstand the vitriol and \u201cbacklash\u201d that would come with it.\n\nHowever, Simi believes the fight for women\u2019s rights in Africa cannot be compared with efforts in the West.\n\nThe situation for women in Africa is much worse because of what she describes as its patriarchal system: \u201cIt expects the woman to cower and to absorb oppression.\u201d\n\nChigul agrees \u2013 given that she says Nigerian women are taught to \u201csweep things under the rug\u201d.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "South Africa has complained it is being punished \u2013 instead of applauded \u2013 for discovering Omicron, a concerning new variant of Covid-19.\n\nThe foreign ministry made the statement as countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa as details of the spread emerged.\n\nEarly evidence suggests Omicron has a higher re-infection risk.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that the new variant was \u201cof concern\u201d.\n\nSeveral cases have now been identified in Europe \u2013 two in the UK, two in Germany, one in Belgium and another one in Italy, while a suspected case was found in the Czech Republic.\n\nIsrael, where the new variant has been confirmed, has decided to ban all foreigners from entering the country from midnight Sunday.\n\nThe measure will last for 14 days, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nOmicron cases have also been detected in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel.\n\nHundreds of passengers arriving in the Netherlands from South Africa are being tested for the new variant.\n\nSome 61 people on two KLM flights were positive for Covid-19 and have been quarantined at a hotel near Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport while they have further tests, Dutch officials said.\n\nThe Netherlands is currently struggling with a record-breaking surge in cases. An extended partial lockdown comes into force there on Sunday evening.\n\nThe new Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November.\n\nA statement by the South African foreign ministry on Saturday strongly criticised the travel bans.\n\n\u201cExcellent science should be applauded and not punished,\u201d it said.\n\nThe bans were \u201cakin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the reaction had been completely different when new variants were discovered elsewhere in the world.\n\nAn African Union official told the BBC developed countries were to blame for the emergence of the variant.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on right now is inevitable, it\u2019s a result of the world\u2019s failure to vaccinate in an equitable, urgent and speedy manner. It is as a result of hoarding [of vaccines] by high-income countries of the world, and quite frankly it is unacceptable,\u201d said AU vaccine delivery alliance co-chair Ayoade Alakija.\n\n\u201cThese travel bans are based in politics, and not in science. It is wrong\u2026 Why are we locking away Africa when this virus is already on three continents?\u201d\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, a number of countries announced new measures:\n\nTravellers from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho and Eswatini will not be able to enter the UK unless they are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents.\n\nUS officials said foreigners would be blocked from travelling from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU.

          "text": "Israel is to ban foreigners from entering the country for 14 days and use surveillance to halt the spread of the new Covid strain, local media report.\n\nThe ban is expected to come into effect at midnight on Sunday, following full cabinet approval.\n\nIsrael has so far confirmed one case of the potentially more infectious Omicron strain first detected in South Africa.\n\nMany countries have since banned travel to South Africa and its neighbours.\n\nSouth Africa has complained that it is being punished \u2013 instead of applauded \u2013 for discovering Omicron earlier this month.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the new variant is \u201cof concern\u201d, with early evidence suggesting a higher re-infection risk.\n\nHowever, the WHO has warned against countries hastily imposing travel restrictions, saying they should look to a \u201crisk-based and scientific approach\u201d.\n\nSouth Africans fear impact of new variant measures\n\nHow worrying is the new Covid variant?\n\nThe Israeli coronavirus cabinet agreed a series of new restrictions at a crisis meeting late on Saturday and are subject to final approval by the larger cabinet.\n\nIn addition to the entry ban for non-Israelis, a three-day mandatory quarantine would be required for all vaccinated Israeli nationals, and a seven-day quarantine for those who have not been vaccinated.\n\nThe cabinet also authorised surveillance of confirmed coronavirus patients by the Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security agency.\n\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said phone-tracking technology would be used.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Israeli authorities had put 50 African nations on the so-called \u201cred\u201d list.\n\nAll Israeli nationals returning from those countries must quarantine in the government-approved hotels and undergo Covid tests.\n\nA ban on foreigners entering Israel from most African countries was imposed on Friday.\n\nIsrael has confirmed more than 1.3 million Covid infections since the start of the pandemic, with over 8,100 deaths, according to America\u2019s Johns Hopkins university.\n\nIn other developments on Saturday:\n\nThe UK announced PCR tests would be mandatory for everyone entering the country, and all contacts of new variant cases would have to self-isolate\n\nAustria saw thousands of people protesting against government plans to make vaccinations mandatory\n\nSwitzerland toughened its quarantine requirements for travellers from several European and African countries. A referendum is taking place on Sunday on whether to keep the covid passport certificate that\u2019s required to get into most public spaces.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised South Africa for promptly sharing information with the world. He said its transparency should serve as a model for the world, and he\u2019d spoken to his South African counterpart about co-operation on vaccinating people in Africa\n\nAustralia said flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi, and Mozambique would be suspended for 14 days. Non-Australians who have been in those countries in the past two weeks are now banned from entering Australia\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIt is a rapidly evolving situation. Omicron\u2019s genetic profile has raised concerns, but there\u2019s a shortage of real-world data that means nobody has the complete picture of what it can do.\n\nIt is unclear how big a threat it poses.\n\nYet, it is at this early stage, in an absence of definitive facts and when there is a danger of both under-reacting and overreacting, that governments have to act.\n\nIt\u2019s like you or me deciding whether to marry someone after the first date. Only the stakes are much higher.\n\nWhat we know is Omicron has mutations that theoretically help it to spread more quickly and there is mounting evidence of that happening in South Africa. It also has mutations that theoretically make vaccines less effective.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how transmissible it is. We don\u2019t know whether it is milder or more severe. We don\u2019t know what will really happen when it comes up against our significant wall of immunity built up through vaccines.\n\nAfter an emergency meeting on Friday, the WHO said the first known confirmed infection from this variant had been collected on 9 November, it had \u201ca large number of mutations, some of which are concerning\u201d.\n\nThe WHO said it would take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as scientists worked to determine how transmissible it was.\n\nThe head of the South African Medical Association told the BBC that the cases found so far in South Africa \u2013 where only about 24% of the population is fully vaccinated \u2013 were not severe, but said investigations into the variant were still at a very early stage.",

          "text": "Dutch health authorities say they have detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew in from South Africa and say they believe some of the infections are of the new omicron variant.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the Dutch Health Authority (GDD) said that the cases were discovered among 624 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport on two flights on Friday.\n\nThat was before the Dutch government restricted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.\n\n\u201cWe know that 61 of the results were positive and 531 [were] negative,\u201d the GDD said.\n\nA spokesman for the National Institute for Public Health (RVIM) meanwhile said the agency was \u201calmost certain\u201d that the cases were of the new variant, but said further testing was needed to be absolutely sure.\n\nThe results are expected to be made public on Sunday.\n\nThose who tested positive are now being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.\n\nA spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the passengers on the flight had either tested negative or shown proof of vaccination before getting on planes in Cape Town and Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cIt goes too far to say we are surprised\u201d by the high number of cases, a KLM spokesperson said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have an explanation.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson said it was possible many of the positive cases were among vaccinated people, or that an unusual number of people developed infections after having tested negative.\n\nDutch health authorities were seeking to contact some 5,000 other passengers who have travelled from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia or Zimbabwe since Monday to urge them to take a COVID-19 test as soon as possible.\n\nPaula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.\n\nZimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 am, almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam. But she then found out she was standing right next to a man who discovered he had tested positive.\n\n\u201cIt was really weird. There was no coordination. There were too few people and there really wasn\u2019t anybody who took control.\u201d\n\nHaving spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days. It\u2019s a little scary, the idea that you\u2019ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive.\u201d\n\nNew York Times global health reporter Stephanie Nolen also tweeted her ordeal at what she called \u201cDystopia Central Airline Hallway\u201d.\n\nShe described how passengers, including babies and toddlers, were crammed together waiting to get tested, while \u201cstill 30 percent of people are wearing no mask or only over mouth\u201d.\n\nDutch citizens are still allowed to return home from southern Africa, while European Union citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.\n\nMedical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel. KLM will continue flights to the region, but all travellers must now test negative before departure and then quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.\n\nThe new variant has been detected as many European countries grapple with a surge in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores, as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its healthcare system.",
