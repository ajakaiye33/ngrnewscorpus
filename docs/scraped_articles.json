          "text": "Igbo groups, Nzuko Ndigbo and the youth wing of Orluzurumee Cultural Union, have frowned at the mayhem in Awomama, Oru East Local government area of Imo State which led to the burning of houses in the local community.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that unknown gunmen enforcing the sit-at-home order had engaged soldiers on duty in a gun duel that claimed the life of an army officer.\n\nHowever, while avenging their colleague\u2019s death, the soldiers reportedly set ablaze houses and shops in search of the gunmen.\n\nReacting, Nzuko Ndigbo, in a statement by its spokesman, Edomobi Promise, expressed shock at the ugly scenario and wondered why the army left out unknown gunmen that attacked them to destroy public and private properties of hapless citizens.\n\nThe sociocultural group called for the sack and immediate prosecution of the brigade commander in Onitsha for the disaster.\n\nThe Nzuko Ndigbo also asked the Chief of Army Staff to investigate the incident to a logical conclusion and punish the culprits or resign.\n\nOn its part, the Orluzurumee Youths, decried the wanton destruction of lives and properties in Awo-Omamma, charging the government to fish out the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\nIn a release jointly signed by its National President, Prince Arthur Madumere and the Publicity Secretary, Ikemba Don Uba, and forwarded to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the Orluzurumee Youths, regretted the brazen and malicious violence meted out to the people of the area by the Nigerian soldiers without a justifiable cause, describing it as inhuman and reprehensive.\n\nThe group recalled its several appeals to the Governor Hope Uzodinma -led government, to engage the various stakeholders of the state and ensure true dialogue.\n\nThe youths regretted that nothing had been done to curtail the recurring mayhems in the Orlu zone.\n\nThe Igbo youths said, \u201cit is an irresponsible act and we must vehemently condemn the dastardly actions notwithstanding whose ox is gored.\n\n\u201cWe will not play politics with the lives and properties of the people of imo state and Orlu zone in particular. We are not one of the political merchant bodies that go about singing the praises of any government in power for some rewards. That is why we must call a spade by its name than calling it a farming implement\u201d.\n\nThe youth organization, implored Governor Hope Uzodinma to as a matter of urgency, constitute a high-powered panel of inquiry and hit the ground running, as the era for playing politics with the lives of the people is over.\n\n\u201cHe should also convene a holistic stakeholder meeting in Orlu zone so as to nip this hydra-headed bug in the head\u201d.\n\nParts of the statement by the Orluzurumee youths said, \u201cWhile Orluzurumee Youths as a responsible youth organization that shelters every youth of Orlu Zone both at home and in the diaspora, totally and wholly condemn the murder of personnel of the Nigerian Army, yet, visiting Armageddon on the hapless and innocent people of the area on which the sad event occurred is reprehensive, inhuman, unprofessional and lacking in every form of justification.\n\n\u201cSadly, and ironically, the area of interest- Oru East, is the local government area of the Governor, who is also the Chief Security Officer, Distinguished Senator Hope Uzodinma.\n\n\u201cLet us state unequivocally and once more that Orlu Zone will not be made a mocking zone by our very own son due to his style of governance. Before him, we\u2019ve had our sons leading this state and we didn\u2019t witness this level of carnage and brigandage\u201d.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says it has discovered that an ostensibly syndicated group is on the prowl to swindle unsuspecting members of the public, particularly millions of Nigerian telecom consumers by capitalising on the generosity of David Adedeji Adeleke, widely known as Davido.\n\nThe Nigerian-American music star, songwriter and producer recently announced he would donate 250 million naira to various orphanage homes across Nigeria.\n\nExploiting Davido\u2019s benevolence, a group of scammers rolled out an advertorial titled \u201cDavido Airtime and Data Giveaway\u201d, which went viral, claiming that Davido is \u201cgiving out free 5K Airtime and 10GB Internet data of All Networks\u201d to celebrate his birthday.\n\nIn the advertorial, the general public is urged to hurry and get the gift by clicking on the links that supposedly redirects them to network sites, where they will be credited with airtime and data.\n\n\u201dThis is a scam, the NCC warned.\n\n\u201dThe NCC wishes to advise our teeming telecom consumers to have nothing to do with the advert or any similar bogus enticements. The adverts are what they are \u2013 social engineering rip-offs designed to get people\u2019s MSISDN and other information that fraudsters can use later to defraud unsuspecting telecom consumers and members of the public.\n\n\u201dFor clarity, the MSISDN is simply the full phone number of a cellphone, in addition to other protocol information. This number is unique and identifies subscribers/owners in a GSM or other mobile networks. Therefore, it suffices to state that any unscrupulous person or unethical hacker can use the number and attendant protocol to undermine the privacy of the real owners of the number through identity theft and other scams.\n\n\u201dThe NCC, therefore, reiterates its earlier warning to telecom consumers to be cautious and not to let their guards down. If a promo or an offer seems too good to be true, then it is likely untrue.\n\n\u201dThe Commission will not rest on its oars in empowering telecom consumers with the requisite information and education in order to protect them from cybercriminals determined to use the telecom platforms to perpetrate frauds.",

          "text": "Petrol to sell for N340 per litre next year, says Kyari\n\nBy Bunmi Ogunmodede, News Editor and Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nLabour cautions govt against unilateral action\n\nN5,000 monthly stipend for 40m Nigerians\n\nGoing by the words of Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) Group Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer (GMD/CEO) Mele Kyari, petrol will sell for between N320 and N340 per liter from February, next year.\n\nKyayi, who said Nigeria would be out of the subsidy regime in the first quarter of 2022, explained that subsidy would have been eliminated this year, but for certain factors that prevented it.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government is planning to give N5,000 each to 40 million Nigerians, representing 40 per cent of the country\u2019s 200 million population, next year to coincide with the take off of the subsidy removal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe NNPCL boss spoke in Abuja at the presentation of the November edition of the World Bank Nigeria Development Update, titled: \u201cTime for Business Unusual.\u201d\n\nBut, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) cautioned the Federal Government against unilateral removal or stoppage of petrol subsidy regime.\n\nThe organised labour warned that removing subsidy without meeting labour\u2019s demands will be met with stiff resistance.\n\nKyari said: \u201cThere will be no provision for it legally in our system, but I am also sure you will appreciate that government has a bigger social responsibility to cater for the ordinary and therefore engage in a process that will ensure that we exit in the most subtle and easy manner.\u201d\n\nHe assured that fuel subsidy removal would definitely be achieved in 2022 as it was now fully backed by law, adding that the price of the product may range between N320 and N340 per liter.\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai assured of governors readiness to back the plan to eliminate the subsidy regime.\n\nEl-Rufai gave the assurance as a panelist, who joined the World Bank presentation virtually, said that if the regime of fuel subsidy was not eliminated, 35 out of the 36 states of the federation may not be able to pay salaries next year.\n\nAccording to him, kerosene which matters most to the masses had been regulated without any hitches, while diesel which was most important to transporters had also been regulated for a long time.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis hullabaloo about petrol is something that we must as a country have a conversation and agree that it has to end. We cannot continue to provide petroleum to our neighbouring countries, which is what we are doing.\n\n\u201cWhy are we doing this? For whom are we doing it? Who is the beneficiary? Which is the cabal that is the beneficiary of this and why should they hold this country to ransom and bankrupt the Nigerian economy?\n\n\u201cRight now, we are losing N250 billion a month and this has to end.

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Onyedi Ojiabor, Abuja, and Robert Egbe, Lagos\n\nThe Federal Government yesterday rejected the report of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry into #EndSARS protest in the state.\n\nIt said that the report, which it described as an equivalence of fake news, was riddled with a lot of errors, inconsistencies and discrepancies.\n\nThe government contended that the report was \u201csocial media tales by the moonlight\u2019\u2019 and sheer waste of tax payers money.\n\nInformation and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed made the government\u2019s position known at a news conference in Abuja.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, many Nigerian were of the opinion that the minister should have waited for the white paper before rejecting it.\n\nThe Lagos State Panel of Inquiry on Restitution of Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Related Matters recently submitted two documents \u2014 a consolidated report on cases of police brutality and another on the Lekki shooting investigation \u2014 to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nThe governor consequently set up a four-man committee to examine the documents within two weeks and \u201cbring forward the White Paper\u201d that would be considered by the state executive council\n\nFew hours later, a version of the 309-page document appeared in the social media.\n\nIn that version, the panel said the \u201ckilling of unarmed protesters by soldiers on October 20, 2020 could be described in the context of a \u2018massacre\u2019\u201d.\n\nMohammed insisted that there was no massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate venue of the protest.\n\nGovernment, according to him, spotted 10 loopholes in the controversial report.\n\nOne of such gaps, according to him, is the panel\u2019s silence on the killing of police personnel and destruction of police stations during the protest.\n\nThe minister said 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed policemen across the country during the protest.\n\nMohammed asked those celebrating the report to go back to it and see whether there was any justification for it or not.\n\nHis words: \u201dIt\u2019s no longer news that the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry that investigated cases of police brutality as well as the incident of October 20th, 2020, at Lekki Tollgate in Lagos has submitted its report. Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well-placed to respond.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any judicial panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence.\n\n\u201cWhat is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of October 20th 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is simply incredible that a judicial panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance.\n\n\u201cInstead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThat report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\n\n\u201dWe have read some critical analysis of the report by a courageous few. One commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers. Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations. Yet another wondered how a judicial panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equates such to a massacre.\n\n\u201cAll these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released.\u201d\n\nSome of the 10 loopholes highlighted by the minister are :\n\n*That the panel threw away the testimony of ballistic experts;\n\n*That the panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post-mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki;\n\n*The man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person.Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night!\n\n*The panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Tollgate in the morning of Oct. 21 2020 to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on Oct. 30th 2020. It said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Toll Gate on the night of Oct. 20th 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on Oct. 21st 2020!\n\n*The panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings.\n\n*How can a judicial panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Tollgate incident listed as numbers three (Jide), 42 (Tola) and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names; and\n\n*Why did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a \u201cmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for \u2018\u2019massacre\u2019\u2019? A massacre is a massacre. What is \u201cmassacre in context\u201d?\n\nThe minister condemned the Cable News Network (CNN) for allegedly celebrating the leaked report.\n\nHe also cautioned the media against joining \u201cthe lynch mob\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CNN has been celebrating the leaked report of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry. In its rush to claim vindication.CNN apparently didn\u2019t even read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration.\n\n\u201cBy that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the Oct. 20th 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground. CNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism.\n\n\u201cSecondly, CNN rushed to the air to celebrate an unsigned and unverified report that is riddled with inconsistencies, errors, discrepancies, innuendoes. That\u2019s double faux pas by a news organization that is eager and willing to compromise standards just to claim vindication.\n\n\u201cSadly, a section of the Nigerian media has also joined the lynch mob. Honestly, in an attempt to vilify government at all costs, they have done themselves a great disservice.\n\n\u201cHow can any news organisation worth its salt write an editorial validating this kind of report? Are they not seeing what others, including journalists and lawyers, are seeing? In a shocking twist, a Nigerian newspaper chose to hail what it calls \u2018\u2019detailed investigative report\u2019\u2019 by CNN, even when the news channel did not even cover the incident of Oct. 20th 2020! It\u2019s a classic case of cutting your nose to spite your face.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the government was insisting on its stand that there was no massacre at the Tollgate in Lagos.\n\nHe said:\u201d There is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all requiredstandards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public.\n\n\u201cThe report in circulation does not meet those requirements. We also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they are afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth to be called a parent.\n\n\u201cWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020.\n\n\u201cThe report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence.\n\n\u201cThe 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the Endsars protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\n\u201cThose who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAs we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families\u201d\n\nAsked if he would quit, Mohammed replied: \u201cThere have been clamours for my resignation right from the day I took this office. So, I take it in its strides.\u201d\n\nThe Christian Lawyers Fellowship of Nigeria (CLASFON) has condemned the alleged threat to the life of member of the panel that probed the protest in Lagos, Ebun Olu-Adegoruwa (SAN).\n\nIts Sub-region Coordinator, Bayo Akinlade, urged the police to protect the activist-lawyer.\n\nAkinlade, a former chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Ikorodu branch, said he was \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by the alleged threat to the lawyer\u2019s life.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State decried Mohammed\u2019s comment on the report.\n\nThe PDP said the minister\u2019s reaction was capable of causing more damage to federal and Lagos State governments\u2019 good intention to for once address the grievances of Nigerians.\n\nLagos PDP Publicity Secretary Gani Taofik said: \u201cThis is not the first time and it is now obvious that Alhaji Muhammed will not verify facts, especially concerning Lagos State before putting the state on the spot. This is a big challenge for the governor to dispute.\n\n\u201cWe commend the steps being taken so far by the state government to compensate the victims. But, we condemn in totality an attempt by Alhaji Muhammed, who never appeared before the panel for a day, to come and discredit the report. And by this attempt, he is ridiculing the country among the comity of nations.\u201d",

          "text": "For failing to pay the N20.5 billion awarded to him as cost of damages in the suit against the July 1 invasion of his residence, embattled Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho), has sued the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami (SAN) and the Department of State Services (DSS) .\n\nThe application is one of the two filed by his lead counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), at an Oyo State High Court, which ordered the secret police to pay him N20.5 billion in aggravated damages and another N500 million in cost for invading his Soka, Ibadan home on July 1.\n\nTwo persons were killed during the invasion and Adeyemo\u2019s valuable belongings were allegedly taken away by the DSS operatives.\n\nThe court had held that the invasion was illegal, adding that Igboho did not violate the constitution by campaigning for Yoruba nation. In the judgment, given by Justice Ladiran Akintola on September 17, the court also agreed that Igboho was being hounded for his agitation for Yoruba nation.\n\nInstead of paying the huge sum, however, the DSS filed an application for stay of execution and an appeal against the judgment.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile filing an objection to the stay of execution, Igboho filed a second application for garnishee nisi against the CBN to pay the N20.5 billion to the applicant out of Federal Government\u2019s purse with the apex regulatory bank.\n\nRead Also: Uncertainty as Igboho spends \u2018over 120 days\u2019 in Benin Republic detention\n\nAlliyu argued that neither the appeal nor stay of execution application affects an application for garnishee.\n\nAt the sitting on Monday, the court agreed and granted the garnishee order.\n\nThe matter was, however, adjourned for CBN to come on January 12, 2022 to show why the court should not make the garnishee order absolute.\n\nIn the DSS\u2019 motion to stay the execution of the damages, it argued in its affidavit that paying the huge sum would plunge Nigeria into further economic woes, adding that it would make the judgment of appeal of little or no effect if paid now.\n\nThe DSS also argued that Igboho is currently a fugitive in Republic of Benin, who would be unable to refund the huge sum should the judgment of the appeal court nullifies the award.\n\nBut, Alliyu faulted the claim in his objection, saying that Nigeria\u2019s budgets are in trillion Naira mark in recent years.\n\nHe also noted that the Office of the National Security Adviser under which the DSS operates gets N136 billion budget annually, which makes it very possible to pay only N20.5 billion.\n\nThe senior lawyer also argued that DSS\u2019 claim that Igboho is a fugitive amounted to contempt of the court in view of the fact that the court had declared him free of any constitutional violation in the September 17 judgment.\n\nIgboho is currently held in Cotonou, Benin Republic on the order of the Nigerian government for the purpose of extradition.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) governors, under the umbrella of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) have revealed that they would secure a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari to resolve sundry issues of zoning arrangements for both the national leadership of the party, the presidential ticket and ultimately the date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nThis is as President Buhari has endorsed February 2022 as new date for the national convention.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nChairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Atiku Bagudu, who was not specific on the exact date for the convention in February, said the convention was shifted because Anambra, Zamfara and two other states, were yet to complete their congresses. The governors reached the agreement at the end of their meeting on Sunday night in Abuja. Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi and Chairman of the PGF, who briefed newsmen, said he did not know when the party\u2019s national convention would hold.\n\n\u201cWe agreed as a forum to seek an appointment to meet with President Buhari and discuss the on-coming national convention of the party.\n\n\u201cMind you, we are just one organ of the party, and since we are making suggestions to both the party and our leaders, I think it is not fair to preempt or disclose it before the meeting holds.\n\n\u201cWe hope to secure that appointment as quickly as possible. We are seeking the appointment as soon as possible, maybe in the next few days.\n\nThe PGF chairman said the forum would keep the public informed on its decision on zoning of elective offices after its meeting with President Buhari.\n\nHe, however, said that insinuations in some quarters that the governors\u2019 planned meeting with Buhari was to discourage him from assenting to the amended electoral bill should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cThat is not correct. I just told you what we are meeting the president for, it is to discuss the on-coming national convention of the party.\u2019\u2019\n\nBagudu said that the forum also discussed issues of good governance, development in the polity and other issues that were pertinent to the progress of the party and the country.\n\nHe said the forum passed a vote of confidence on the party\u2019s Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\n\u201cWe passed a vote of confidence on the caretaker committee that has done a wonderful job, chaired by Gov. Buni of Yobe and two other governors who are members of the committee.\u2019\u2019\n\nBagudu lauded the committee for successfully organising congresses for the party at the ward, local government and state levels.\n\nHe noted that the committee had been making efforts to carry every party member along, including those that were aggrieved or felt dissatisfied by the outcome of the congresses.\n\nThe governor said such individuals were invited and persuaded to support the party in the interest of all.\n\n\u201cSometimes, electoral processes are not without annoyance, but we are happy with the conduct of the caretaker committee,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe PGF chairman assured that the APC would not implode anytime soon as was being speculated in some quarters, adding that those expressing such fears were not representing reality.\n\nBagudu said the APC had brought into its fold three outstanding governors, the deputy governor of Anambra, members of the National Assembly and distinguished Nigerians from all walks of life.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking for Nigerians to join us so that we can unify and serve Nigerians. While other parties are sending people away, we are, in spite of our strength, inviting them to join us so that together we can reposition and keep the progressive agenda going,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the outcome of the November 6 Anambra governorship election, Bagudu said Nigeria had won and president Buhari had made a statement about that. Although the forum could not disclose its resolution on the outcome of the Anambra State governorship election, it, however, argued that conducting an election under such tensed security situation, should be enough celebration.\n\n\u201cThat an election took place in Anambra. I think Nigeria has won and the President had made a statement about that. We are equally proud of our security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe party candidates in all elections have the pride of place to determine their views about the outcome. But we are proud that under the APC, that an election that hitherto people thought will be impossible had taken place,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGovernor Buni, who also spoke on the outcome of the meeting, said: \u201cThe Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum after their meeting, has suggested February to the party and the president has concurred so we are going ahead to plan for the convention in February.Nigerians should expect more unity and progress as a result of the forthcoming convention.\u201d\n\nOn insinuations that he might be delaying the convention to extend his tenure as the Caretaker Chairman of the APC, Buni said, \u201cAm I a jobless person who is always trying to extend his tenure; to do what? I have my primary responsibility as a Governor to go back to my state and carry out my primary responsibility.\n\n\u201cWhat I am here to do is ad-hoc and of course to reposition the party and that is exactly what we have been able to achieve.\u201d\n\nMeanwhie, the APC Rebirth Group/Concerned APC Stakeholders has disassociated itself from calls for the dissolution of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. The group in a statement described the call as an intemperate action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the considered opinion of the APC Rebirth Group that all party members must show respect and regard for offices and those who occupy them. While we believe that all groups and individuals within the party have the absolute right to express their grievances and even push for the needed reforms, just like we have done severally, we nonetheless believe that such actions must be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the party.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

While we reiterate our position on inclusion and the need to build a party that works for everyone, we call on all who feel strongly about the APC to exercise decorum, respect the rules of the party and not seek to engage in anti-social behaviours that violate the sanctity of the APC.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has said there have been 25 attacks on Nigerian schools this year, with 1,440 students abducted.\n\nThis statistics was given on Tuesday even as UNICEF revealed that over the past five years, the West and Central African region had consistently had some of the highest numbers of United Nations-verified grave violations against children in armed conflict.\n\nA statement on Tuesday from the UN agency also said that since 2016, the West and Central Africa region ranks first in the world in terms of number of children verified as recruited and used by non-state armed groups and victims of sexual violence, ranks second in terms of abduction, as one of the regions most affected by attacks on schools and hospitals, with more than 1,500 verified incidents.\n\nAccording to the statement, the data was revealed in a new UNICEF publication that calls for increased support for efforts to prevent and respond to grave violations against children, as well as for scaling-up the documentation of such violations.\n\nIt said: \u201cSince 2016, West and Central Africa has recorded more than 21,000 children verified by the United Nations (UN) as recruited and used by armed forces and non-state armed\n\ngroups, and more than 2,200 children victims of sexual violence. More than 3,500 children were abducted and more than 1,500 incidents of attacks on schools and hospitals were recorded.\n\nUNICEF, while lamenting that in Nigeria, there have been 25 attacks on schools so far this year, with 1,440 students abducted, said Nigerian children continue to suffer the impact of crisis.\n\nIt decried that a protracted conflict had been raging in north-east Nigeria for 12 years now, with thousands of children in the region killed, maimed, abducted, displaced, and experienced multiple violations of their human rights.\n\nUNICEF recalled that in 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1612 to establish a United Nations mechanism for monitoring and reporting on the following six grave violations against children during armed conflict: which include killing and maiming of children, recruitment and use of children, abduction of children, rape and other forms of sexual violence committed against children, attacks on schools and hospitals, and denial of humanitarian access.\n\nIt lamented that since 2005, 1 out of 4 United Nations verified grave violations in the world was committed in West and Central Africa, insisting that last year alone, over 6,400 children (32 per cent of whom were girls) were victims of one or more grave violations in the region.\n\nThe statement quoted UNICEF Chief of Maiduguri Field Office in Nigeria, Phuong Nguyen to have said: \u201cNigerian children \u2013 whether they are the direct targets of violence or collateral victims of conflict \u2013 are caught up in the ongoing insecurity we are seeing across the country. This is unacceptable,\u201d\n\n\u201cThis important report shows the extent of the grave violations of children\u2019s rights in Nigeria and across the West and Central Africa region \u2013 violations that must be ended by all parties to conflict. Children must have an opportunity to grow, learn, work and contribute to the healthy future of this country. That can only happen if they are protected from violence and the worst impacts of conflict.\u201d\n\nMajor humanitarian crises continue to unfold across West and Central Africa. The situation in Cameroon, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and multi-country emergencies, including crises in the Central Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin region, are having devastating consequences on children and communities.\n\nWith a surge in armed conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic, 57.5 million children in West and Central Africa are in need of humanitarian assistance, a figure that has almost doubled since 2020. 5.1million of those children in need of humanitarian assistance are in Nigeria.\n\nIn response to the spike in children\u2019s unmet essential needs, including protection, UNICEF has been working with governments, local authorities and partners to strengthen the monitoring and reporting mechanism, support the release and reintegration of children from armed forces and groups, reunite separated children with their families, provide medical and psychosocial care for conflict-affected children, and provide care for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cMental health and psychosocial support for children and adolescents are essential and at the heart of UNICEF\u2019s humanitarian response. When provided with the necessary care and psychosocial support, access to schooling and access to livelihoods, children are able to process what they have experienced and rebuild their lives,\u201d said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa.\n\nUNICEF called on all partners, including relevant governments and donors, to intensify their efforts to secure adequate financial and technical resources to ensure that grave violations were reported and verified, and for support for children affected by conflict.\n\nUNICEF also called on all parties to conflict in the region to prevent and end grave violations against children, and to ensure perpetrators are held accountable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Busha, a Nigeria-based digital platform that helps people buy, sell and store cryptocurrency, has raised seed funding of $4.2 million in a round led by Jump Capital.\n\nCadenza Ventures, Blockwall Capital, CMT Digital, Greenhouse Capital, Raba Capital, and other investors also participated in the financing round.\n\nAccording to the company, the new funding will go towards deepening its market positioning in Nigeria, the leading crypto economy in Africa where all of its users are based.\n\nFounded in 2018 by CEO Michael Adeyeri and Chief Product Officer (CPO) Moyo Sodipo, the cryptocurrency exchange claims to have more than 200,000 users and holds an ambition to \u201conboard the next set of one million Africans\u201d into the crypto economy.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the real difference in financial freedom crypto can make in the lives of our users, and we\u2019re very motivated to extend this to more people on the continent,\u201d Adeyeri said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBusha is currently working on an expansion into other countries across West Africa and will roll out when its 30-person team is comfortable they can both protect the users there and support any compliance efforts by the authorities, Sodipo told TechCabal via email.\n\n\u201cThe full West African corridor has our immediate attention, and we\u2019re also excited about East Africa, particularly Kenya and Uganda. We\u2019re currently prospecting those regions for opportunities to expand safely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup recently launched a revamped version of its app that allows users to buy crypto for less than $1 (\u20a6550) while offering features such as one-click limit orders and automated recurring buys.\n\nIt intends to launch a savings feature that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto next month and early next year, another for users to spend cryptocurrencies at select online and offline retail outlets. The latter is being developed in partnership with SureGifts, a gift card company.\n\nThe Busha team. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nAs crypto adoption in Africa continues to accelerate, the inclusive offering from Busha is in line with the company\u2019s stated mission to make crypto accessible to a broader population and reduce entry barriers.\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on being first in the market to introduce tangible innovations like instant payouts and 24/7 human customer service,\u201d Sodipo said. \u201cThis funding will empower us to do more faster, improve our security, and take a definitive leadership position in our target markets.\u201d\n\nBusha\u2019s offering is sure to appeal to young Nigerians who are increasingly trading crypto in a bid to have better financial mobility and wealth creation opportunities amid harsh economic realities.\n\nFor context, there are more than a million registered accounts from Nigeria on Paxful, an international peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace. That accounts for more than 25% of the platform\u2019s customer base, with Nigeria only second to the US by volume of bitcoin traded.\n\n\u201cNigeria and the African continent are one of the most promising places for crypto to make a significant impact in offering financial freedom to millions of individuals,\u201d Peter Johnson, Partner at Jump Capital said on the rationale behind the investment in Busha.\n\nWith more Africans getting into the crypto world, Busha plans to leverage resources from its new investors to offer \u201cmarket-beating prices and return more value to its customers while remaining proactive with compliance and regulation,\u201d the company said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which is \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 million from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most-watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest-earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most-watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper-competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in-app integrations. But, as none of these payment apps is widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller microtransactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for the Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest-growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my run-ins with crypto experts, exchange founders, and enthusiasts, there are usually tales of losses that lead to their love for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese tales range from scams to losing access to their crypto wallets to investing a lot in crypto-assets that didn\u2019t have any prospects of success.\n\nRegardless of how tragic their beginnings with crypto are, they always seem to have an enduring love for these digital assets and eventually turn their losses into significant gains.\n\nMoyo Sodipo, Co-Founder and CPO of crypto exchange, Busha, also has one such story to tell. His experience saw him team up with Micheal Adeyeri (CEO) to build Busha for people to learn about crypto without getting their fingers burnt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Busha announces a seed raise of $4.2 million led by Jump Capital with participation from Cadenza Ventures, Blockwall Capital, and CMT Digital, among others.\n\nDuring a chat with Techpoint Africa, Sodipo\u2019s excitement about the fundraise was all too apparent.\n\n\u201cAll the hard work we\u2019ve put in over the last few years is finally being recognised, but it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d\n\nBut the journey, since Busha launched on February 19, 2019, to this fundraise has been anything but smooth. And Sodipo revealed a lot during our chat.\n\nIt started at Jumia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R (Busha Co-Founders) Micheal Adeyeri, CEO & Moyo Sodipo CPO\n\nSodipo and Adeyeri were part of Jumia Nigeria\u2019s pioneer employees in 2012. Sodipo was an IT DevOps engineer, while Adeyeri was a software engineer. Experiencing first-hand what it takes to build a startup at Jumia, their time there helped them build a customer-centric platform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the eCommerce/digital economy since 2012, so we\u2019ve been able to watch the ecosystem grow. And the experience we gained from our time at Jumia, which was the beginning, shaped us to be resilient.\n\n\u201cWe wore many hats at Jumia, which is common with startups. For example, if you\u2019re a gateman in a startup, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t double as a driver.\u201d\n\nThough Sodipo was an IT DevOps engineer, he worked closely with customer support and saw how vital customer relationship and experience was. He also worked with other teams, such as marketing and operations, which gave him an overall view of what makes up a startup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI worked closely with people in the marketing team, the supply chain side of things, and the operational side, so I understood the broad aspect of a business.\n\n\u201cI also worked closely with the co-founders, and it made me understand that when you\u2019re building a business, you cannot be obsessed with only the technology part of things.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sodipo, Busha takes its customers very seriously, paying close attention to user feedback and providing round the clock \u201chuman customer support.\u201d\n\nAdeyeri and Sodipo also worked together at SureGroup, where they also gathered more experience in building startups.\n\nFirst contact with cryptocurrencies\n\nBull run, a common crypto lingo, is used when crypto asset prices surge and people get mind-boggling amounts of interest on their investments.\n\nAt this time, cryptocurrencies become very popular and more people try to get in on the action, thus fueling the bull run even more.\n\nThere have been a lot of interesting bull runs since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, the price of Bitcoin rose by 3,200% in three months, going from $1 in April to $32 in June. Shortly after that rise, there was a bear market \u2014 the opposite of bull runs \u2014 and Bitcoin\u2019s price crashed to $2.\n\nMany other bull runs followed, but Sodipo got wind of Bitcoin during the fifth bull run that saw it go from $1,000 to $19,850. The cryptocurrency started getting the attention of governments and economists, and even more coins were created to compete with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price over the years. Source: Investopedia.\n\nA friend told Sodipo about Bitcoin in 2017, but he didn\u2019t give it much thought until he realised Bitcoin had increased so much in value, and he could have made a lot of money if he\u2019d listened to his friend.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Wow! That is so insane.\u2019 I got excited and started getting interested.\u201d\n\nBut despite his interest and excitement, he experienced a series of losses.\n\nAt the time, there were a lot of initial coin offerings (ICOs) \u2014 the crypto version of initial public offerings (IPOs) \u2014 going on. An ICO is a type of fundraising done by startups that offer crypto-related services. The startup puts its tokens up for sale, and people buy them hoping that the business takes off, the token increases in value, and they get good returns on their investment.\n\nHowever, unlike IPOs, ICOs are not regulated, so some turn out to be scams, some of which Sodipo fell victim to.\n\n\u201cAs with most new people in crypto, I got my fair share of, let\u2019s say, breakfast,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cthere are a lot of tokens that I bought back then that are worth zero right now.\u201d\n\nSodipo wasn\u2019t the only one losing money to crypto; Adeyeri was also getting served his fair share of \u2018breakfast\u2019. Interestingly, amidst the crypto heartbreaks, there was a business idea.\n\n\u201cWe had looked into crypto in general and gotten our hands beaten. We thought if Nigerians want to get into this thing and keep making mistakes and losing money, Nigeria will be left out of this whole crypto thing.\n\nAnother thing that made crypto popular back then was MMM. So there was this notion that Bitcoin and MMM were the same, and that was another narrative that we needed to correct.\u201d\n\nThey attempted to correct this belief by creating a platform that made getting into cryptocurrency simple and scam free.\n\nBuilding Busha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusha website homepage\n\n\u201cI call cryptocurrency the future of money. People want to be able to tap into this future because it\u2019s something that is borderless, fast, seamless and easy to use as long as you give people the right platform.\u201d\n\nBusha started as a way of clearing the misconceptions about cryptocurrencies. According to Sodipo, some people thought they needed to buy an entire Bitcoin, currently valued at $59,000, to own cryptocurrency.\n\nThey got users to understand that they could buy in small bits, as low as $10. They launched Busha, and the simple-to-use platform grew organically over the years.\n\nUnder the leadership of Sodipo and Adeyeri, Busha has done well without any external funding. The platform currently has over 200,000 registered users and has executed 1.5 million trades.\n\nHowever, bootstrapping a company to this point had its challenges.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when we had not gotten enough users, we were just winging it. The business was pretty much living from hand to mouth.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how hard things got, the co-founders ensured salaries were paid.\n\nTo increase their user base, they created a learning platform that taught people all they needed to know about cryptocurrencies. And the business continued to grow, majorly through referrals.\n\nBusha helped customers learn and simplified crypto buying and selling into a few clicks.\n\nExpectedly, Busha faced regulatory challenges, which are common with Nigerian crypto exchanges.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directed all deposit money banks, non-bank financial institutions, and other financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto-related transactions.\n\nWhile Sodipo admits crypto regulation in the country is a touchy topic, he says the directive was a major hurdle, one which Busha has successfully innovated around.\n\nCrypto startups responded to the CBN\u2019s directive with P2P. By the end of Q1 2021, Nigerians had transacted $99.1 million worth of Bitcoins despite the directive. The country also reached an all-time trading volume of $1.5 billion on Paxful.\n\nHowever, it seems the CBN is clamping down on P2P as Nigeria\u2019s Bitcoin weekly trading volume dropped by 43%.\n\nAffirming that Busha is pro-regulation, Sodipo said that \u201cFrom inception, we\u2019ve always been self-regulated. In as much as there is no actual licence, we\u2019ve done KYC, made sure we are a compliant exchange when it comes to everything.\n\n\u201cSo any day that regulators come knocking, we\u2019re able to let them know \u2018even though you didn\u2019t tell us to do this, we\u2019ve always been doing it.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith $4.2 million at their disposal, Sodipo revealed that the plan is to remain the best platform for customer experience.\n\nSpeaking about expansion plans, he said, \u201cWe want to be the platform that connects Africa to the new digital economy.\u201d\n\nThe future of Busha\n\nWhen I asked Sodipo where he sees Busha in the next five years, he laughed lightly, and I could tell that he was excited about the thought of what Busha could become in half a decade.\n\n\u201cThe next five years will be very interesting. Even though everyone seems to be clamouring for Bitcoin and crypto, we\u2019re still at the very early stages of crypto.\n\n\u201cIn the next five to ten years, I see Busha being your one-stop-shop for everything that has to do with crypto. Whether it\u2019s buying and selling, getting in and out of NFTs, or plugging into DeFi, I see Busha being the place that you think of first when you want to do anything cryptocurrency-related.\u201d\n\nIt appears Sodipo sees Busha replicating JP Morgan\u2019s role in the banking industry. However, only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology and the Internet have disrupted every aspect of our lives as we knew it. From education to healthcare and transportation to finance, nothing is as it was 20 years ago.\n\nWith the ease brought by using technology in business processes, users\u2019 expectations have changed. Customers now expect speed and efficiency and startups are springing up hoping to capitalize on that.\n\nThe process of sending money from one bank to the other 25 years ago was very different from what obtains today. Transfers often took several days to get to recipients. Withdrawing money meant going to the branch where you opened your account.\n\nHowever, innovation in the banking sector has seen the industry evolve, such that transfers are now done in a few minutes. And these changes have brought unprecedented growth to the industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarely two decades after banks like United Bank for Africa and Guaranty Trust Holding Company upset the status quo, fintech startups are doing the same.\n\nUsers can now open accounts on their mobile phones without visiting bank branches. Lending startups like Carbon and FairMoney now offer near-instant collateral-free loans to users. In less than five years of operations, Kuda Bank reportedly has about 1.4 million users, and following the completion of its Series B round, is now valued at $500 million.\n\nYet, for all this progress, businesses still face difficulties when interacting with other businesses. For example, a user who wants to fund their Risevest account from their PiggyVest account has to route the funds through their bank.\n\nThis need to facilitate transfers between stores of value is one that has plagued a lot of businesses. So far, the fintech industry is leading the way with the presence of API startups such as Mono, OnePipe, and Okra. Using an API provided by these startups, businesses can access users\u2019 financial data across several platforms.\n\nFor the uninitiated, an API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. It is a sort of software middleman that allows businesses to communicate and exchange data with each other.\n\nImagine for a moment that you want to book a hotel during a trip. Ideally, you would head to the hotel\u2019s website to do that, but what if you wanted more options? You would have to use a hotel booking app.\n\nWhile using these apps, you can book hotels without necessarily being on the hotel\u2019s website. What enables the hotel booking app to aggregate this information for you is an API.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, API fintech startups are solving this problem for financial institutions, but what if you need this infrastructure and are not in the fintech industry? This is where Thepeer comes in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThepeer, a startup that builds the infrastructure that enables businesses to share data with one another, is looking to solve this problem.\n\nThe data that these businesses share is not limited to financial data. Speaking on how the startup serves its customers, Michael Okoh, Theeper Co-founder and CTO, says, \u201cLet\u2019s say a business wants to send money to another business, they do their business and what we do is just ask, \u2018Which user are we tagging the transaction to? What\u2019s the context of this transaction? What\u2019s the amount of this transaction? So we just give context to data from the daily operation of businesses.\u2019\u201d\n\nUsing the example above, with Thepeer\u2019s API, users can transfer funds from their PiggyVest wallets to their Risevest wallets without leaving the app.\n\nBy providing these businesses with an API that they integrate on their platforms, Thepeer can give context to transactions that occur between businesses. The startup works with any business that uses a wallet.\n\nThepeer offers a similar value proposition for companies. For example, if Jumia Food and Kuda Bank had Thepeer\u2019s API integrated on their platform, Jumia Food could charge a Kuda Bank account user without the need to move between platforms. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself so let\u2019s go back to the inspiration for Thepeer.\n\nIn the beginning\n\nIn 2017, just fresh from his A-Levels, Chike Ononye decided to take a gap year. He felt it was a good idea to explore his love for technology, which he had from childhood, outside the Nigerian school environment.\n\nHe reasoned that he\u2019d get more practical experience than was on offer in school. At a Laravel Conference that year, he met Okoh, and the two hit it off immediately, their shared love for technology providing a common ground.\n\nLater that year, the two friends got into the HNG Internship. Hotels.ng, a hospitality startup founded by Mark Essien, has a three-month internship programme \u2014 the HNG Internship.\n\nThere, interns \u2014 mostly newbies \u2014 are introduced to software development fundamentals with weekly tasks designed to showcase the skills gained.\n\nAt the end of each stage of the Internship, participants who do not meet specified criteria are eliminated from the programme. Think Big Brother, but for software programming. By the end of the internship, participants are expected to have acquired essential skills enabling them to get roles with the programme\u2019s partner organisations.\n\nOnonye and Okoh got into the Internship and somehow found themselves in the same group for the internship duration. Working on tasks together helped them develop an understanding that is proving useful as they build Thepeer.\n\nAfter the Internship, they worked with different startups, including Softcom, Toptal, and Abeg, until 2021, when Ononye had the idea for Thepeer.\n\n\u201cI and Trojan (Michael) have been friends since 2017. We were on the HNG Internship and were on the same team throughout. So it felt like Trojan was the best person to work with when I figured out this problem. We had the idea months back and decided to bring other people on board to help us with it,\u201d Ononye says.\n\nWhile the startup claims to serve any type of business, for the moment, they are starting with fintech startups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAny business with a wallet can be our customer. We actually started with fintechs because when you talk about wallets, they are like the first point of contact, and they typically have wallets,\u201d Ononye explains.\n\nHaving spent a few months with a small team of four working on the project, Thepeer released its beta on April 26, 2021, to get a few businesses signed up and test how well the product worked. The team made changes based on the feedback it received and went live in August 2021.\n\nThough the startup is not a fintech company, most of its customers are small to mid-sized fintech startups. They are also in the process of integrating other startups. In response to a question on how much they had raised from investors, the startup declined comments.\n\nNavigating the murky waters of entrepreneurship\n\nEven for the bravest entrepreneurs, building a startup in Nigeria is tough. And it is harder for startups in the fintech sector because they have to contend with regulators such as the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nFintech startups have had to deal with challenges ranging from the February cryptocurrency ban to the freezing of accounts of startups accused of facilitating or engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. Expectedly, Thepeer has faced similar challenges, and the co-founders reveal that they have spent the first few months getting the required licences.\n\nThe nature of the business requires that they deal with customer data, so the startup has fulfilled compliance requirements for Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).\n\nPartnership with Flutterwave\n\nWhen starting, startups sometimes have to build several features to enable them to provide different services to their customers. With often limited resources, new startups may find it difficult to get their operations off the ground. In such situations, having access to the API of a more established startup could help them get off on the right foot.\n\nConsequently, it makes perfect sense that Thepeer has launched with support from one of the continent\u2019s most prominent startups. Because the startup handles a lot of financial data, they have tapped fintech giant Flutterwave as their financial partner. However, that is not all that Flutterwave could offer them. With the difficulties new startups face, Flutterwave presents an opportunity to leverage their experience and wide coverage to onboard more businesses.\n\nIn addition to allowing Thepeer to use its API, Flutterwave also provides expertise in regulatory compliance, one area where the young startup needs guidance. In July, Flutterwave announced that they had hired former MTN and Visa executive, Oluwabankole Falade as their Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The appointment seemed like a proactive move on Flutterwave\u2019s part, with the fintech sector having seen heavy regulation in the country.\n\nProviding the kind of service that they do, Thepeer operates in a sort of a regulatory grey area. While they currently work with fintech startups, they are not a fintech startup, and this could present a problem. With Flutterwave\u2019s backing, though, they should be well placed to surmount any regulatory challenge that they may face.\n\nWhile there are expansion plans, the focus, at the moment, is on Nigeria as the founders aim to improve the value the startup offers businesses. As they look to the future, Ononye believes that the team\u2019s passion, buy-in, and drive \u2014 qualities they hope to pass down to subsequent team members \u2014 would be crucial to their success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Interview with Mr Eazi \u2014 Artiste, tech bro, investor",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how people see artistes. Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\nHis friends crowdfunded $1,000 for him to shoot his first video. And in an interview with Coachella in 2019, he said his current achievements wouldn\u2019t have been possible without their show of largesse.\n\nThis perhaps explains his strong commitment to investing in up-and-coming talents in Africa, nurturing them along their path.\n\nApparently, music has always been a hobby for Mr Eazi. This explains his interest in many other business ventures for which he has justifications.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cthe similarities between a musician or a creative as a startup and a business became very glaring to me; it\u2019s almost the same thing.\u201d\n\nHe compared a founder pitching their idea to a creative coming forward to sell their unique product. In hindsight, this understanding is what has guided him towards success in every venture he has undertaken.\n\nMr Eazi also has an obsession, and you get no prizes for guessing that it is linked to the creative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been driven by freedom, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with this from early in life.\u201d\n\nIn context, it was the entrepreneurship spirit. Oluwatosin wanted to have the creative freedom to try his hands on anything he put his mind to.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship truly makes me free,\u201d he said as we continued our chat, oblivious of the passing of time.\n\nIt has always been music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi on stage. Source: Instagram\n\nMany artistes are known for their signature intros, which can be phrases or chants, and Mr Eazi is identified by \u201cZagadat.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure what it means, but whenever you hear it, everyone knows Don Eazi is about to hit the stage or screen.\n\nThe longer we spoke, the more difficult it was to distinguish between Mr Eazi, the artiste, the startup founder/CEO, and the investor.\n\nAnd when we started talking about how he successfully wears many hats, he told me why he made music the fulcrum of all he does.\n\n\u201cI read Jay-Z\u2019s book, Empire State of Mind, and it felt like I\u2019d seen the blueprint, the future, and what could come out of it. That\u2019s why I decided that of all the things I was passionate about that showed traction, and it was going to be music.\n\n\u201cI always knew it would come to this phase where I get influential enough for the music to open doors for me and provide the cash flow needed to have more creative freedom.\u201d\n\nMr Eazi always had the spirit of entrepreneurship. While studying in Ghana, he started bringing artistes to his university as he ran an entertainment business on the side.\n\nWhen the artiste still had a softer image, he released mixtapes that attracted local and international audiences. Life is Eazi Vol.1 \u2013 Accra To Lagos and Life is Eazi Vol. 2 \u2013 Lagos to London particularly got massive streams, with the first at number four on Billboard\u2019s World Album charts, and the other, the most-streamed Nigerian Album in 2018.\n\nIn July 2016, Mr Eazi held a hugely successful headline show in London, which he said convinced him that he was on the right path. Earlier in 2021, he celebrated five years of leaving his mobile phone trading startup, Phonetrader Nigeria, to focus on music.\n\nHowever, I believe he started getting attention before then. In 2015, he had a hit record, Skin Tight. Then in 2016, he became a man of the moment with Leg Over.\n\nEven though there was never a particular moment when he decided he wanted to become an artiste, Oluwatosin made bold to say that every other aspect of his entrepreneurship life leverages the fact that he\u2019s Mr Eazi, the artiste.\n\n\u201cI was just doing exactly what I was doing, which is creating. And this has opened doors for me in my entire career.\u201d\n\nAnd once he recognised people\u2019s growing interest in what he created, he continued to improve.\n\nMany moments stand out for Oluwatosin in his musical career, but he referenced one of his firsts.\n\n\u201cOne of my proudest creations so far is my COMO UN BEB\u00c9, my song with J Balvin and Bad Bunny last year. I think that was a big moment for me because it took me one year to get into the Latin music scene.\u201d\n\nFun fact: Mr Eazi invented Banku, a style of music that\u2019s a mix of Ghanaian and Nigerian pop. He was the only African that featured on two tracks on Beyonce\u2019s The Lion King soundtrack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for African music right now. There used to be one artiste having the moment, and it felt like the next person had to wait their turn. But right now, the space is such that multiple people are simultaneously having their moments, recording individual worldwide success.\u201d\n\nMr Eazi as an investor \u2014 building Africa\u2019s first music incubator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Twitter\n\nMr Eazi has built a reputation for nurturing and promoting African talents. And he does this through several initiatives, emPawa Africa being the most popular.\n\nLaunched in 2019, it is an incubator that provides artistes with funding and resources to market their music, access radio and TV airplay, and train them to become independent music entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cHaving a music company that represents different parts of Africa, which is what we\u2019ve been able to do in the two years of setting up, is great.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria\u2019s Joeboy and Ghana\u2019s J Derobe were discovered through this incubation programme.\n\nAnd the initiative keeps evolving. Mr Eazi revealed that setting up a formidable team that ensures the business runs smoothly in his absence would be a major achievement.\n\nAt this point, I wanted to know how the initiative is funded, especially since he is an independent artiste running his music business with personal funds.\n\n\u201cemPawa Africa started with funding from the music business. My music career was able to supply the cash to start emPawa Africa. In fact, before emPawa, the revenue from my music career was used to run my other businesses.\n\nThere was another source of funding \u2014 a convertible loan \u2014 from now defunct 88mph, and the business is currently in the process of closing another fundraise.\n\nMr Eazi and his friends also run Zadagat Capital, a syndicate fund that invests in the African tech space. Asides from three others not yet in the press, the latest startup in its portfolio is PawaPay, an Africa-focused payments startup, announced in August 2021.\n\nAfricans supporting Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m investing in music and also in businesses that intersect with the creative industry. It\u2019s more like an alternative merch for my fans.\u201d\n\nThere are other investment ventures associated with the Mr Eazi brand.\n\nIn 2020, he launched the African Music Fund (AMF) with an initial raise of $20 million. This fund provides financial support for African musicians to expand and distribute their music content and increase revenue.\n\nDepending on the contract signed, AMF not only funds an artiste but also manages their brand and ensures growth. AMF recoups its initial investment in instalments.\n\nMr Eazi also wants Africans to have equity in African businesses. Apart from the syndicate, another way he plans to do this is by allowing his fans to make revenue from his content.\n\nThis is quite similar to how record labels operate. When labels sign an artiste, they make an investment and get a percentage of the artiste\u2019s gains.\n\n\u201cThe money is an advance on future earnings. Being an independent artiste, I\u2019m thinking of how to engage my fans more. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why not get the fans to actually participate and have equity in the success they create?\u2019\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, he announced that this would kick off with his album due for release in 2022. Fans can invest in the album, knowing that over time, as they listen, they will get revenue commensurate with their investment.\n\nThere\u2019s more to Don Eazi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been travelling a lot, I\u2019m trying not to be on tour till next year after the album release. The major thing I\u2019m doing this year is making the album and doing a lot of stuff with Zagadat Capital.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Eazi is gracing a few stages to keep in touch with his fans. For the better part of 2021, he has performed in a few shows and strategic concerts in New York, Miami, Sacramento, Johannesburg, and the UK.\n\nBesides creating music and investing, Mr Eazi loves movies; he even thinks he\u2019d do well as an actor. The Don also loves comedy, gaming, travelling, and studying history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Rising food price and wellbeing of Nigerians",
          "text": "The welfare of Nigerians is deteriorating every day due to rising prices, especially that of food items in the market.\n\nAn increase in food prices has been in existence even before COVID-19, which may be attributed to the level of insecurity experienced in the North, pronounced conflicts between farmers and herders within the country, the closure of Nigeria\u2019s land borders by the government, among others.\n\nDuring COVID-19, however, the limitations encountered during the production process put more pressure on the prices of goods.\n\nAn observation of the price of some commodities from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data set shows that the average cost of 1kg local rice year-on-year increased by 4.95 percent and month-on-month 0.01 percent increase. Likewise, the average price of 1kg tomatoes increased year-on-year by 19.28 percent, while a 1kg of white Garri, the popular poor man food, experienced a year-on-year 27.91 percent increase.\n\nFurthermore, Akandu Godwin, the Rivers State chairman of Nigerian Rice Producers Association, complained about the lack of mechanised equipment like caterpillars and bulldozers needed for cultivation by rice farmers, which made rice production difficult. He warned the government against the neglect of rice farmers in the state.\n\nRead Also: Rising food prices threaten Nigeria\u2019s economic recovery -IMF\n\nA World Bank report shows that most Nigerians cannot afford three square meals nor have one time or the other skipped a meal during the day. The report shows that between July and September 2018, 43.3 percent of adults missed at least one meal, 39.3 percent ran out of food, while 13.5 percent went the whole day without food. A decline was experienced between January and February in 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who skipped food, ran out of food and went the whole day without food in Nigeria were 27.3 percent, 25.1 percent, and 6.4 percent, respectively. These were the period before the COVD-19.\n\nHowever, by November 2020, 56.1 percent of households skipped at least one meal, 48.0 percent ran out of food, and 18.3 percent went the whole day without eating. The increase in these percentages may be attributed to the economic effect of the pandemic on the country.\n\nThe inability of people to eat well and quality food also have a great impact on their physical and mental health as well as causing malnutrition and stunted growth in children.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate for October 2021 is 15.99 percent year-on-year, which is 1.76 percent more than the 14.23 percent recorded in October 2020.\n\nThe expert also noted a high probability that food prices will double by the end of 2021. This implies that the purchasing power of people will reduce, which may also be attributed to the fall in per capita GDP.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 1.87 year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020 despite the global disruption experienced from COVID-19, the fall in oil prices, and the barriers to international trade. The real GDP of Nigeria, which was expected to grow by 2.1 percent, was -6.1 percent and -3.6 percent respectively in the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the year but increased in the last quarter of 2020 by 0.01 percent.\n\nSince 2015, the per capita Gross Domestic Capita growth rate has been negative. The growth rate in Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita are -0.03 in 2015, -4.17 in 2016, -1.79 in 2017, -0.68 in 2018, -0.38 in 2019 and -4.26 in 2020\n\nIn a bid to mitigate the rising effect of poverty among the people, the Federal Government disbursed a cash transfer of N58 billion in the past two months. The national coordinator of Home Improvement Programme Conditional Cash Transfer, Halima Shehu, in a statement during the two days sensitisation training programme for the beneficiaries said that the program was meant to support development goals to enhance household consumption. Shehu explained that this program was founded with the slogan \u201cBeta don come\u201d to help the lower class.\n\nHowever, Nigeria, with over 200 million as of 2021, still has over 40% of its entire population living below the poverty line. The report further shows that more than 4 out of 10 people in Nigeria live below the national poverty line. Millions more just live above the poverty line, thus making them susceptible to falling back into poverty due to the shock experienced from the pandemic. The World Bank report in 2020 shows an expectation of a future rise in extreme poverty in Nigeria by about 15 to 20 million Nigerians moving into poverty. There is a high level of poverty experienced, especially among rural dwellers and specifically women.\n\nCOVID-19 has added around 88 million to 115 million people to the list of impoverished people. World Bank estimates show that 97 million people moved into poverty as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThis implies that the government must put in place adequate measures and programs to curtail the economic effect of the pandemic on Nigerians, as it is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the welfare of the citizens.",

This is an example of the kind of innovation and collaboration needed to close the energy access gap, enable a just and inclusive energy transition, and unlock a sustainable future for all.\u201d\n\nThe DART Programme aims to improve the overall investment case of the renewable energy sector and attract more international and local investors, particularly commercial banks as lenders to the sector.\n\n\u201cI am particularly impressed by this collaboration between All On, Odyssey, and the Global Energy Alliance, and that Nigeria has been selected as the country in which to kick start this initiative,\u201d said the Rural Electrification Agency MD, Ahmad Salihijo. \u201cThis could be a breakthrough in bridging the finance gap that hinders the growth of small and medium sized enterprises in the nascent renewable energy sector in Nigeria.\u201d",

They are the litmus test of the system. The workshop is to let them know what they will be facing as they retire and assure them that the system is not a death sentence.\n\n\u201cThey will be the first set to witness the scheme and don\u2019t know what it holds for them, which is what prompted this sensitization.\u201d\n\nWashington further noted, \u201cThe challenges of the former system led the Federal Government to source for another credible system, which led to the present system of pension being operated in this country.\n\n\u201cOver time, pensioners retire monthly without payment of gratuity and only get an irregular pension. This new scheme enables workers to save towards their final disengagement from the system. Workers are asked to contribute eight percent of their monthly pay, while the state adds its own 10 percent matching fund, making it 18 percent.\u201d\n\nNoting some advantages of the new system, the PS stated, \u201cThis system enables the retirees to have direct contact with their pension fund administrations by presenting letters of disengagement and by the same month, there would be seamless migration from salary to pension payment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation for all involved in the scheme as the Government will continue to fulfill its 10 percent matching fund. These are the first set of intending retirees that will be migrating into the contributory pension scheme.\u201d\n\nAddressing the intending retirees, the guest speaker, Mr. Adebola Bello, who spoke on \u2018Retirement Benefits Under the Contributory Pension Scheme,\u2019 said the scheme came with modalities, which include transparency and uniform regulation.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, the retiree\u2019s programme is for 18 years. It doesn\u2019t mean that after 18 years the retiree doesn\u2019t have money there again. There will be funds since the fund is being invested. Returns on investment give value to the Contributory Pension Scheme,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

We see a university as a place for learning and dispatching knowledge via technology.\n\n\u201cThe strategy used two or three decades ago for our university education might not be applicable today.

Hopefully, you will lead that stage of helping us rethink university education in Nigeria in the post-COVID-19 era.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the future university, we will be quite reliant and dependent on technology.

It is a powerful domestically significant bank in Nigeria,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens to First Bank, it means that something has gone wrong with the Nigerian banking system. And it is for this reason that we are taking advice on how to keep the bank afloat very seriously,\n\nThe governor noted that the First Bank\u2019s success was linked to the timely intervention of the apex bank.\n\n\u201cSix years ago, as a result of the accumulation of non-performing loans on the books of First Bank, the fair value of the share price was approximately N2 per share, and we took it on while everyone else was fleeing. Because we have cleaned up the balance sheet, non-performing loans have dropped dramatically. People are seeing that First Bank is returning to profitability and are now competing for a stake in the company,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy should I argue that people are competing for the shares of First Bank, which was N2 six years ago and they fled from it? Now, the last time I looked at First Bank\u2019s share price, it was N11.55kobo over the weekend. I am pleased to see that they are competing for First Bank shares. Of course, we all know that First Bank is so large that no single person can own it. In running the banks, they should see themselves as representing others.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF), on Tuesday, disclosed that over the past five years, the West and Central Africa regions have consistently had some of the highest numbers of unverified grave violations against children in armed conflict.\n\nThe is even as it further disclosed that\n\nin Nigeria, there have been 25 attacks on schools so far this year, with 1,440 students abducted.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, Nigerian children continue to suffer the impact of crisis. A protracted conflict has been raging in North-east Nigeria for 12 years now.\n\nIt said thousands of children in the region have been killed, maimed, abducted, displaced, and experienced multiple violations of their human rights.\n\nThe data was contained in a new UNICEF publication that called for increased support for efforts to prevent and respond to grave violations against children, as well as for scaling-up the documentation of such violations.\n\n\u201cSince 2016, the West and Central Africa region ranks:F irst in the world in terms of number of children verified as recruited and used by non-state armed groups and victims of sexual violence. Ranks second in terms of abductiona and as one of the regions most affected by attacks on schools and hospitals, with more than 1,500 verified incidents.\n\n\u201cSince 2016, West and Central Africa has recorded more than 21,000 children verified by the United Nations (UN) as recruited and used by armed forces and non-state armed groups, and more than 2,200 children victims of sexual violence. More than 3,500 children were abducted and more than 1,500 incidents of attacks on schools and hospitals were recorded.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, there have been 25 attacks on schools so far this year, with 1,440 students abducted.\n\n\u201cIn 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1612 to establish a United Nations mechanism for monitoring and reporting on the following six grave violations against children during armed conflict: 1) killing and maiming of children, 2) recruitment and use of children, 3) abduction of children, 4) rape and other forms of sexual violence committed against children, 5) attacks on schools and hospitals, and 6) denial of humanitarian access.\n\n\u201cSince 2005, 1 out of 4 United Nations verified grave violations in the world was committed in West and Central Africa. Last year alone, over 6,400 children (32 per cent of whom were girls) were victims of one or more grave violations in the region,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cNigerian children \u2013 whether they are the direct targets of violence or collateral victims of conflict \u2013 are caught up in the ongoing insecurity we are seeing across the country. This is unacceptable,\u201d said Phuong T. Nguyen, UNICEF Chief of Maiduguri Field Office in Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis important report shows the extent of the grave violations of children\u2019s rights in Nigeria and across the West and Central Africa region \u2013 violations that must be ended by all parties to conflict. Children must have an opportunity to grow, learn, work and contribute to the healthy future of this country. That can only happen if they are protected from violence and the worst impacts of conflict,\u201d added Nguyen.\n\nMajor humanitarian crises continue to unfold across West and Central Africa. The situation in Cameroon, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and multi-country emergencies, including crises in the Central Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin region, are having devastating consequences on children and communities.\n\nWith a surge in armed conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic, 57.5 million children in West and Central Africa are in need of humanitarian assistance, a figure that has almost doubled since 2020. 5.1million of those children in need of humanitarian assistance are in Nigeria.\n\nIn response to the spike in children\u2019s unmet essential needs, including protection, UNICEF has been working with governments, local authorities and partners to strengthen the monitoring and reporting mechanism, support the release and reintegration of children from armed forces and groups, reunite separated children with their families, provide medical and psychosocial care for conflict-affected children, and provide care for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cMental health and psychosocial support for children and adolescents are essential and at the heart of UNICEF\u2019s humanitarian response. When provided with the necessary care and psychosocial support, access to schooling and access to livelihoods, children are able to process what they have experienced and rebuild their lives,\u201d said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa.\n\nUNICEF called for all partners, including relevant governments and donors, to intensify their efforts to secure adequate financial and technical resources to ensure that grave violations are reported and verified, and for support for children affected by conflict.\n\nUNICEF also called on all parties to conflict in the region to prevent and end grave violations against children, and to ensure perpetrators are held accountable.",

Akintola, the court had ordered DSS to pay Igboho the sum of N20.5 billion naira as exemplary damages.\n\nThe DSS, in a 16 paragraph affidavit, in support of Motion on Notice, to stay the execution of the judgment of the court in suit No/M/435/2021 and an injunction pending the determination of the pending appeal sworn to, on behalf of the DSS by one of its operatives, Johnson Oluwole, and filed before the court on Monday, November 22, 2021, the DSS said that the Yoruba Nation agitator was currently undergoing extradition procedure to bring him back to Nigeria.\n\nIt said: \u201cThat it is a fact that the applicant Chief Sunday Igboho has been declared a fugitive by the Nigerian Police Force sometime in the month of June 2021.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that the applicant was arrested on July 19, 2021, and he is currently in custody of the Beninese security agents, undergoing extradition procedure to come back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that one of the reliefs granted by the court is that the respondents should pay the plaintiff the sum of N20bilion.\n\n\u201cThat it is a known fact that statistics has shown that the economy of the country is in a dire situation and is in the process of recovering from Covid-19 pandemic crisis.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that withdrawing the whooping sum of N20billion from the country\u2019s account will adversely affect the smooth running of the country.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that the applicant is under investigation by the security agents for reasonable acts that is inimical to the corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that until the applicant is extradited, charged and either convicted or acquitted by a court of law, the payment of the sum of N20billion might facilitate the allegations labelled against the applicant.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that until the applicant is extradicted back to the county the enforcement of the judgment especially the N20billon, will render a situation of helplessness on a positive judgment of the court of appeal,\u201d DSS said.\n\nAt the resumed hearing of the matter, Igboho\u2019s counsel, Yomi Alliyu SAN, filed two applications filed a preliminary objection and attached a sworn affidavit stating that it amounts to contempt of court to detain Igboho anywhere in the world at the instance of Nigeria after an order of Court that he should neither be arrested, detained or harassed by the Respondents.\n\nAlliyu said that the budget of Nigeria runs into trillions whilst NSA gets over N136 billion annually; hence paying N20.5billion, can in no way affect NSA Office or the FGN.\n\nHe also told the court that the Respondents have not paid the sum of N20.5billion cost awarded. That all these constitute contempt of court.\n\nIn his response, counsel to DSS, counsel,P. O. Fabiyi, on sighting the preliminary objection said he came to withdraw their motion because the 1st Respondent has taken over the prosecution of the matter.\n\nBut the court reminded him that the AGF was always in the matter, then he said he needed time to put their house in order.\n\nAlliyu also filled an application for Garnishee Nisi against Central Bank of Nigeria to pay N20.5billion to the Applicant out of Federal Government monies with CBN.\n\nThe learned silk argued that neither Appeal nor stay affects an application for Garnishee.\n\nHowever, the Court agreed with the silk\u2019s submission and granted the Garnishee Nisi, proceeding.\n\nConsequently, Justice Akintola, adjourned the matter for CBN to come on January 12,2022, to show cause why the court should not make the Garnishee order absolute.

That all these constitute contempt of court.\n\nIn his response, counsel to DSS, counsel,P. O. Fabiyi, on sighting the preliminary objection said he came to withdraw their motion because the 1st Respondent has taken over the prosecution of the matter.\n\nBut the court reminded him that the AGF was always in the matter, then he said he needed time to put their house in order.\n\nAlliyu also filled an application for Garnishee Nisi against Central Bank of Nigeria to pay N20.5billion to the Applicant out of Federal Government monies with CBN.\n\nThe learned silk argued that neither Appeal nor stay affects an application for Garnishee.\n\nHowever, the Court agreed with the silk\u2019s submission and granted the Garnishee Nisi, proceeding.\n\nConsequently, Justice Akintola, adjourned the matter for CBN to come on January 12,2022, to show cause why the court should not make the Garnishee order absolute.

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Tuesday interrogated a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode.\n\nOfficials of the anti-graft agency confirmed this to Channels Television, saying he was invited to answer questions relating to the forgery of a medical report which he allegedly procured to evade his trial before a Federal High Court in Lagos.\n\nFani-Kayode was said to have arrived at the Lagos Office of the commission in the company of his lawyer at about 1pm.\n\nHe is still answering questions from the EFCC investigators as of the time of this report.\n\nThe commission said it would give an update on the interrogation later when it concludes its investigations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Terrorists Plotting To Establish Camp In Niger, Govt Raises Alarm\n\nFani-Kayode is standing trial on an alleged N4.6 billion fraud before Justice Daniel Osiagor of the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos.\n\nThe EFCC had charged him alongside a former Minister of Finance, Nenadi Usman, and two others on 17 counts of conspiracy, money laundering, and fraud.\n\nAt the last sitting of the court on October 13, the judge had imposed a cost of N200,000 on him due to his failure to appear before the court for his re-arraignment following the transfer of the former trial judge, Justice Rilwan Aikawa.\n\nHe was ordered to pay the fine or stand the risk of having his bail revoked after he failed to appear before the court for his re-arraignment.\n\nSame Excuse\n\nInstead of appearing for his re-arraignment, the former minister had sent a letter to the court, claiming that his doctors had placed him on bed rest.\n\nCounsel to the EFCC, Mrs Bilikisu Buhari had informed the court that the letters by the second defendant had become numerous and had also become an excuse for him to evade trial.\n\n\u201cThis is the third time he will be writing this type of letter from the same hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever he doesn\u2019t want to attend court, this is the type of letter we get.\u201d\n\nBut Fani-Kayode\u2019s counsel, Bobo Fred-Ajudua, cut in and informed the judge that although his client\u2019s illness was a recurring one, he had attended court regularly, and this could be shown from the court\u2019s records.\n\nHe, thereafter, asked the court to grant an adjournment in favour of his client. At that point, the trial judge decided to go through the court\u2019s file and after searching, he discovered that the second defendant had actually sought a similar medical excuse five times.\n\nThe court then asked the defence counsel to take one of two options which were to either revoke the bail of the second defendant or to impose a fine of N200,000 to be paid before the next trial date.\n\n\u201cFrom my records, the second defendant had written the court five times excusing his trial on medical grounds. February 1, 2018; May 30, 2019; November 24, 2020; March 21, 2021, and today\u2019s letter dated October 9, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe second defendant is to pay a cost of N200,000 before the next adjourned date, as the recurring medical excuses have been a pattern that slows down this trial,\u201d the judge held.\n\nThe defence counsel chose the latter option.\n\nJustice Osaigor then adjourned the case until November 30 for re-arraignment of all the defendants.\n\nIn counts one to seven, the defendants were alleged to have unlawfully retained over N3.8 billion which they reasonably ought to have known formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act of stealing and corruption.\n\nIn counts eight to 14, the defendants were alleged to have unlawfully used over N970 million which they reasonably ought to have known formed part of an unlawful act of corruption.\n\nFani-Kayode and one Olubode Oke who is said to be at large, in counts 15 to 17, were alleged to have made cash payments of about N30 million \u2013 over the amount allowed by law, without going through a financial institution.\n\nAll the offences were said to have contravened the provisions of Sections 15 (3) (4), 16 (2) (b), and 16 (5) of the Money laundering (prohibition) (Amendment) Act, 2012.",

MINISTER OF\n\nINFORMATION AND CULTURE, ALHAJI LAI MOHAMMED, IN ABUJA ON TUESDAY NOV. 23RD 2021 ON THE REPORT OF THE LAGOS STATE JUDICIAL PANEL OF INQUIRY AND RESTITUTION TO INVESTIGATE CASES OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND THE INCIDENT OF OCT. 20TH 2020 AT LEKKI TOLL GATE\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\n2. It\u2019s no longer news that the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry that investigated cases of police brutality as well as the incident of Oct. 20th, 2020, at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos has submitted its report. The submission happened while I was out of the country on national assignment. Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well placed to respond.\n\n3. Without mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any Judicial Panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of Oct.\n\n20th 2020. It is simply incredible that a Judicial Panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\n\n4. Gentlemen, we have read some critical analysis of the report by a courageous few. One commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers. Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations. Yet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre. All these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released.\n\n5. We do not intend to bore you by rehashing details of the discrepancies, innuendoes, inconsistencies and errors in that report. They are already in the public space. Let us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc.\n\ni) \u2013 The report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony:\n\n\u201dThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the\n\ntimeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries\n\nsustained by the Victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities,\n\nthat no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at\n\nthe protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the\n\ntimeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot\n\nWounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were\n\nexamined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by\n\neither low velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms\n\n(artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is however\n\ncertain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military\n\ngrade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have\n\nbeen significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries\n\nrecorded. This was clearly not the case.\u2019\u2019\n\nii) \u2013 The same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki!\n\niii) \u2013 The man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night!\n\niv) \u2013 The panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Toll Gate in the morning of Oct. 21 2020 to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on Oct. 30th 2020. It said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Toll Gate on the night of Oct. 20th 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on Oct. 21st 2020!\n\nv) \u2013 The panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings. Where are the family members of those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Toll Gate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\nvi) \u2013 How did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself ended up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons?\n\nvii) \u2013 How can a Judicial Panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Toll Gate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola) and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\nviii) \u2013 Why did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a \u201dmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for \u201dmassacre\u201d? A massacre is a massacre. What is \u201dmassacre in context?\u201d\n\nix) \u2013 The report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the Endsars protest. Does this mean that the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings?\n\nx) \u2013 The report didn\u2019t make any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos. I think it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u2019.\n\n6. It is clear, from the ongoing, that the report of the panel in circulation cannot be relied upon because its authenticity is in doubt. Besides, the Lagos State Government, being the convening authority, has yet to release any official report to the public.\n\nNeither has the panel done so. The cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and Gazette on it. It is therefore too premature for any person or entity to seek to castigate the Federal Government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and unvalidated report.\n\n7. CNN AND OTHERS\n\nThe CNN has been celebrating the leaked report of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry. In its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t even read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration. By that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the Oct. 20th 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground.\n\nCNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism. Secondly, CNN rushed to the air to celebrate an unsigned and unverified report that is riddled with inconsistencies, errors, discrepancies, innuendoes. That\u2019s double faux pas by a news organization that is eager and willing to compromise standards just to claim vindication.\n\n8. Sadly, a section of the Nigerian media has also joined the lynch mob. Honestly, in an attempt to vilify government at all costs, they have done themselves a great disservice. How can any news organization worth its salt write an Editorial validating this kind of report? Are they not seeing what others, including journalists and lawyers, are seeing? In a shocking twist, a Nigerian newspaper chose to hail what it calls \u2018\u2019detailed investigative report\u2019\u2019 by CNN, even when the news channel did not even cover the incident of Oct. 20th 2020! It\u2019s a classic case of cutting your nose to spite your face.\n\n9 CONCLUSIONS\n\ni) \u2013 Gentlemen, there is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required standards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public. The report in circulation does not meet those requirements.\n\nWe also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they are afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth to be called a parent.\n\nii) \u2013 We reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on Oct. 20th 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did.\n\nSuch allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence. The Federal Government has never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded SARS personnel\n\niii) \u2013 The 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the Endsars protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\niv) \u2013 Those who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\nv) \u2013 We are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families.\n\n10) Gentlemen, I thank you for your kind attention. I will now take your questions.",
