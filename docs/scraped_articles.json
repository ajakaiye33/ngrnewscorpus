          "text": "Says doom looms\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nAs protesters mark one year of bloody EndSARS protest, Wednesday, a non-profit making organization, One Love Foundation, OLF, has lamented failure of government to address demands made by youths to have a sense of belonging in the process, policies and programmes of government for better living.\n\nThe Founder and President, OLF, Patriot Patrick Eholor, stated this while speaking with Vanguard said the pain of police brutality and killings that occurred during the protest across the country is still fresh as many young people are nursing their injuries including those who lost their property and businesses.\n\nAccording to Eholor, EndSARS protest is not only about the atrocities of the SARS department of the Nigeria Police Force rather a cumulative mismanagement of the entire system by those entrusted with leadership, and hopelessness has become the mindset of young people triggered this civil revolution.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne year ago, Nigerian youths woke up from slumber. In a civil, peaceful and unarmed protest, they sent a strong message to the leadership of this country that they have had enough of bad governance and demanded a change of the status quo.\n\n\u201cAn unprecedented turnout of youths took to the streets nationwide to save their beloved country from the consequences of leadership deficit. It\u2019s like a civil revolution witnessed in advanced and progressive countries.\n\n\u201cWhat started in Lagos spread like wildfire to other parts of the country. The Nigeria Police Force became a tool to channel the grievances and disgust on how this country is run.\n\n\u201c#EndSARS protest is not only about the atrocities of the SARS department of the Nigeria Police Force but rather a cumulative mismanagement of the entire system by those entrusted with leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hopelessness that has become the mindset of the youths triggered this civil revolution. Looking at the demands of the youths, not only did they demand police reforms but also called for a stop to bad governance.\n\n\u201cBad governance led to the decay in the Nigeria Police and other sectors in the country. In a typical Nigerian fashion, the #ENDSARS protest was hijacked by the leadership. The opposition saw the opportunity to sabotage the government and hijacked the protests and became sponsors.\n\n\u201cThese factors triggered more violence and casualties. The government promised to look into the demands protesters. They immediately disbanded the SARS and initiated some youth palliative programs.\n\n\u201cThis surface measures though commendable but is not enough to tackle the endemic problem. The leadership has not learnt any lesson if they fail to address the root cause of the protest, which is misgovernance.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re worried, doom looms\n\n\u201cAggrieved youths are being made scapegoats of the protest. The government side is being given soft landing.\n\n\u201cWith these developments, nothing has been learnt from the protest. The demographic advantage of the youth population makes it a time bomb if the factors that triggered the protest are not seriously addressed by the leadership.\n\n\u201cThe inequity, injustice, nepotism, economic hardships, unemployment, and others are glaring causes. If not checked, then nothing has been learnt. Compensating the aggrieved youths during the protest will soften the ground.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of these recommended lines of action by the leadership to appease the teeming youths of Nigeria, it will be hard to proffer solution. The voice of civil rights groups, social and political commentators and human rights activists must be taken serious.\n\n\u201cNigeria is very fragile and the youths are determinants of the way forward, if not well handled, will be catastrophic. The next one might not be a mere civil revolution.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

But it was victory at a price as strike duo Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner suffered injuries.\n\nThe holders lost their last game against Juventus in Turin but there was no mistake here as the Swedes were completely outclassed.\n\nAndreas Christensen put Chelsea ahead early on with his first goal in 137 appearances for the club from Thiago Silva\u2019s pass and Jorginho doubled the lead from the spot after Lukaku was fouled by Lasse Nielsen, the forward limping off with what looked like an ankle injury.\n\nWerner pulled up with hamstring trouble before half-time, but Chelsea\u2019s progress continued smoothly as his replacement Callum Hudson-Odoi set up another substitute Kai Havertz for a neat finish for their third just after the break.\n\nMalmo were over-powered and Jorginho scored from the spot again after 57 minutes following Eric Larsson\u2019s foul on Antonio Rudiger, with replacement keeper Ismael Diawara having no more success than Johan Dahlin did in the opening half.\n\nChelsea\u2019s expensive cruise\n\nThis was the most comfortable of nights for Chelsea as they put the misery of their loss to Juventus behind them in emphatic fashion.\n\nThe Italians remain three points ahead of Chelsea in Group H, but still have to visit Stamford Bridge.\n\nAnd the Blues were in a different class to their Swedish opponents and effectively settled matters in the 48th minute when Havertz chipped home a composed third goal.\n\nThe win, however, was overshadowed by those injuries to Lukaku and Werner.\n\nLukaku was hurt as he was brought down by Nielsen for Jorginho\u2019s first penalty, seemingly taking the full weight of the Malmo player on his ankle.\n\nThe club\u2019s record signing required lengthy treatment and despite walking to the halfway line in an attempt to carry on, he was clearly struggling and substituted.\n\nWerner clutched his hamstring racing into the area and, again, was taken straight off.\n\nChelsea\u2019s next game is at home to the Premier League\u2019s bottom club Norwich City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, but the main worry for manager Thomas Tuchel is that both Lukaku and Werner may face lengthy lay-offs.\n\nTuchel will be highly satisfied with how Chelsea handled this straightforward task in a professional and ruthless manner.\n\nThey remained in control throughout with their outstanding passing and efficient movement of the ball.\n\nTuchel, though, must now hope Chelsea\u2019s win does not come at too much of a cost as he awaits the medical bulletins on Lukaku and Werner.

I hope and pray that our Nigerian brothers will forge a closer solidarity in this field with us, the Republic of Turkey.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a bid to deepen cultural ties with Nigeria, Turkey, yesterday, commissioned the Yunus Emre Turkish Cultural Centre in Abuja.\n\nThe centre was commissioned by the First Lady of Turkey, Emine Erdogan, assisted by the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, and the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq.\n\nIn her remarks, Erdogan said she was glad to be back in Nigeria after five years, saying it was a great pleasure to open the Yunus Emre Cultural Centre.\n\nErdogan said the centre, which the Turkish government opened in friendly and brotherly countries, was a sign of the importance Turkey attached to its relations with other countries.\n\n\u201cWith this centre, we will be opening the doors of wisdom of Anatolia to our Nigerian brothers. As you will have the opportunity to get to know Turkish culture more closely, you will also be able to learn Turkish Language as you wish,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*El- Rufai says he has been writing letters to FG for designation of bandits as terrorists since 2017\n\n*Urges FG to recruit 774,000 youths to Help fight criminality\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Kaduna state government said a total of 343 people were killed, while 830 others were abducted by bandits between July and September 2021.\n\nThe Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, disclosed this while presenting the Third Quarter Security report to Governor Nasir El-Rufai on Wednesday at the Government House, Kaduna.\n\nHe also said 69 of the bandits were \u201cneutralised\u201d during the period under review.\n\nHe lamented that the activities of bandits are crippling rural economy and a threat to education as many schools are under threat by the criminals.\n\nIn the last two quarters between January to June, a total of 545 people were killed while 1,723 others were abducted by bandits.\n\nAruwan said in the latest report, the Southern Kaduna Senatorial district recorded the highest number of death with 193 while Kaduna Central and Kaduna North Senatorial Districts recorded 130 and 20 deaths respectively.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom July to September 2021, a total of 343 persons died due to banditry, communal clashes, violent attacks, and reprisals\u201d, adding that, 50 of the victims were women and 22 were minors.\n\nThe commissioner said the high number of deaths in Southern Kaduna \u201cis largely made up of victims of violent attacks and reprisals in Zangon Kataf, Kaura and Kauru Local Government Areas.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese areas witnessed series of clashes early in the year, which spiraled into a succession of increasingly deadly communal and inter-ethnic attacks across the three LGAs\u2026\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said, of the 830 people kidnapped in the third quarter, 732 people were abducted in Kaduna Central Senatorial District, with many of the kidnappings\n\noccurring in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Igabi, Chikun and Kajuru LGAs.\n\nHe said, \u201cChikun LGA had 243 citizens kidnapped, Birnin Gwari LGA 143, while 132 citizens were kidnapped from Kajuru LGA. Igabi LGA had 106 kidnapped, while 98 persons were kidnapped from Giwa LGA.\n\n\u201cSouthern Kaduna Senatorial District recorded 51 kidnapped persons, with Kachia LGA reporting the highest number of 28.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Senatorial District recorded 47 kidnapped persons, with 16 of these from Zaria LGA\n\n\u201cIn total, 222 women, and 179 minors were kidnapped in the third quarter across the\n\nstate\u201d.\n\nThe commissioner also disclosed that 77 farms were destroyed across the state.\n\n\u201cVarious reports were received of farms destroyed by roving cattle in the third quarter\u2026\n\n\u201cIn the third quarter of 2021, there were 77 reports received, relating to destruction of crops across the state, notably in Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Chikun, Kachia, Kaura, Kauru and Zangon Kataf LGAs. The actual figure could be higher, taking unreported\n\ncases into account\u201d, the commissioner said.\n\nAruwan noted that such destruction of crops has exacerbated the tensions in frontline LGAs, many often resulting in violence.\n\nHe however said, the state government was working on a template to manage the phenomenon.\n\nHe lamented that banditry has hampered farming activities in the frontline areas of the state as the criminals continue to attack and abduct farmers working on or on their way to their farms.\n\nAruwan said, several farmers have been killed adding that the bandits extort protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether with an attendant negative impact on crop yields.\n\n\u201cThe most affected\n\ncommunities are in the frontline local government areas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia, Kagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jemala and Sanga.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said the further that primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions in the state remain under threat from bandits adding that \u201cteaching and learning activities in frontline areas have been severely hampered.\u201d\n\nHe said the health sector has also been affected as hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat from bandits.\n\n\u201cStaff of hospitals and health centres have been killed, kidnapped and injured by armed bandits during these attacks, and this constitutes a danger to healthcare service delivery in frontline areas\u201d, Aruwan said.\n\nHe lamented that the economy of rural communities is \u201cnear-total collapse\u201d, as bandits dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and \u201cdisrupted the operation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said the activities of bandits have lowered the potential for social cohesion and interaction across the state, creating a reluctance to travel or conduct socio- economic activities to their fullest extent; security considerations assume the\n\nforemost place He said the state government has continued to sustain its strategies to address the security challenges\n\naffecting the state in the third quarter.\n\nReceiving the report, Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed sympathy.\n\nHe said the government frowns at the actions of individuals, groups and political actors who incite citizens to arm themselves.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric of self-help is dangerously misunderstood; it is a recipe for descent into anarchy. Individuals who perpetrate violent attacks are very often not around when retributive actions are taken by the victims, and so citizens who are perceived to share ethnicity or religion with the attackers are then targeted in reprisal\u201d, the commissioner said.\n\nReceiving the report, Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed sympathy with all those who have suffered pains and sorrow arising from insecurity, \u201cdespite our sincere and consistent efforts and investments of hard-earned resources.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that in 2017, the state government wrote letters to the federal government, requesting that bandits be declared as terrorists.\n\nEl-Rufai who said the state government aligned itself with the resent resolution of the National Assembly on bandits, noting that it is only when they are declared as terrorists that it will allow the Nigerian military to attack and kill the bandits without any major consequences in international law.\n\n\u201cWe in the Kaduna State Government, have always aligned with the declaration of bandits as insurgents and terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have written letters to the Federal Government since 2017, asking for this declaration because it is the declaration that will allow the Nigerian military to attack and kill these bandits without any major consequences in international law.\n\n\u201cSo, we support the resolution by the National Assembly and we are going to follow up with a letter of support, for the Federal Government to declare these bandits and insurgents as terrorists, so that they will be fair game for our military. \u201cThis is the view of the Kaduna State Government\u201d, he said.\n\nEl-Rufai said the state government will soon establish a Farmers/Herdsmen Reconciliation Council in the state while committees will be set up at the Local Government, Chiefdom and Emirate levels.\n\nThe governor said many state governments in the North-West and the North-Central have adopted an unconventional approach to help the federal security agencies to better protect communities.\n\n\u201cThere is no alternative to launching simultaneous operations.\n\n\u201cI call for a consensus between the Federal Government and the the 36 states on an emergency programme of recruitment into the security agencies.\n\nGovernment can change the game significantly by hiring 1,000 willing youths from each of the 774 LGAs in the country into the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThis will be a surge in numbers that is unprecedented since the civil war. An influx of 774,000 new boots on the ground will be a significant blow against criminals and an employment boost\u201d, he said.\n\nHe expressed sympathy for all the pains and sorrow insecurity is causing, \u201cdespite our sincere and consistent efforts and investments of hard-earned resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you that we are working hard to solve this problem and it is our solemn duty to do so.\n\n\u201cWe offer our condolences to the security agencies and the families of the security officers that have been killed while trying to keep our people safe\u201d, El-Rufai said\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Delta to pay over N102m compensation to victims\n\n\u2022Amnesty International urges Buhari to fulfil promise of police reform\n\nSegun James in Lagos and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nWith lessons drawn from the string of violence that followed the youth-led nationwide protests against police brutality in October last year, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, brokered a reconciliation with youths in the state, promising not to give up his belief in them.\n\nYoungsters across the state used the opportunity of yesterday\u2019s Eid-Maulud national holiday to come together to participate in a peace conference aimed at creating a common platform for conflict resolution.\n\nIn Delta State, the government announced to pay a total of N102, 450, 000 to victims of police brutality after accepting the report of a judicial panel of inquiry into reported cases in the state.\n\nAmnesty International called on President Muhammadu Buhari to fulfil the promise he made to reform the Nigeria Police, one year after the #EndSARS incident.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who attended the peace forum, listened as the youths led conversation on how they could effectively channel their grievances to the authorities.\n\nThe event themed, \u201cRebuilding for Greatness: Peaceful Conflict Resolution,\u201d held at the LTV Blue Roof, in Ikeja. It was organised by the Ministry of Youth and Social Development and facilitated by the governor\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Youth Matters, Saheed Akanbi.\n\nA seven-man discussion panel moderated by Mazi Sam Uche Anyamele, a filmmaker, set the tone for the governor\u2019s response to various suggestions and ideas shared by youths at the event.\n\nWith a commitment to peace pledged by the youth, the governor, who declared that the moment for true reconciliation had begun, said Lagos could now undergo a total healing process after last year\u2019s coordinated attacks on its assets, which also resulted in loss of lives and livelihoods.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cToday is a day of reconciliation and it is about our teeming youths. This is the moment to create a common ground and take ownership of our future. We have, indeed, assessed what we have passed through as a people; it\u2019s now the moment to come together and build our lives together.\n\n\u201cThis event is about aggregating all the conversations of the millions of youths that have been represented here. All of us have agreed that, when we work together, we can build a resilient society we will truly be proud of. We will continue to build, engage and work with our young people.\n\n\u201cI certainly will not give up on you as partners in progress and your ability to bring about positive changes.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cI thank all the youths, who participate in this forum, for the valuable suggestions offered and the ideas shared. I\u2019m taking full responsibility and ownership of all the feedback recommended for me here. All the points have been taken and I will continue to rely on them in the course of governance.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Youth and Social Development, Hon. Segun Dawodu, said the state government recognised the youth as stakeholders in peace building and violence prevention. Dawodu stressed that the governor\u2019s physical presence at the event was an indication of his commitment to addressing the issues faced by the youth.\n\nRepresented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr. Oluwagbemiga Aina, the commissioner said the aftermath of negative conflicts would never be beneficial to any society.\n\nThe keynote speaker and Deputy Vice Chancellor of the Lagos State University (LASU), Professor Wahab Ellias, said the theme of the event connoted a resilient city. Ellias stated that conflict remained endemic and part of the society\u2019s makeup.\n\nMeanwhile, the announcement from Delta State came hours to the first anniversary of the #ENDSARS# protests that rocked the country in 2020, leading to the official dismantling of a unit of the Nigeria Police called Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nSecretary to Delta State Government (SSG), Chief Patrick Ukah, revealed this in a statement in Asaba. Ukah said the decision to mitigate the pains suffered by some of the victims was based on the consideration of the report by the judicial panel of inquiry.\n\nThe judicial panel, which was inaugurated by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in October 2020, received a total of 86 petitions for which it conducted public hearings in Asaba and Warri, with full legal representation for all parties.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cDelta State Government wishes to inform all Deltans and residents of the state that government has received and considered the Report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was constituted to receive and enquire into complaints of police brutality and related extra-judicial killings in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of mention that the panel was not able to make recommendations on the entire petitions received by it, as some of these petitions are currently pending in various courts in the state. Hence, making pronouncements on them would be subjudice. In addition, some of the petitions were struck out by the panel during the hearing sessions for various reasons.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, the panel was able to establish acts of police brutality in some cases, resulting in death or denial of personal liberty and accordingly awarded monetary compensation for the victims in these cases.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the panel upheld judgements earlier delivered by High Courts in the state for various cases of police brutality, which judgements have not been complied with till date, including payment of judgement debts associated with them.\n\n\u201cThe state government, having considered the panel\u2019s recommendations in these two categories of cases, has accepted to pay the incidental claims recommended for the victims, amounting to the sum of N102,450,000.00 (One hundred and two million, four hundred and fifty thousand naira). This payment would be effected in due course.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, in a statement, called on Buhari to fulfil his promise of reforming the police. The organisation made the call in a statement titled, \u201cNigeria: No justice for victims of police brutality one year after #EndSARS protests.\u201d\n\nIt alleged that despite promises of reform, police impunity had continued in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement by Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, Ms. Osai Ojigho, said, \u201cA year on, despite the gravity of these human rights violations, not a single member of the security forces has been prosecuted while judicial panels of inquiry set up to investigate abuses by officers have made little progress.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari must fulfil his promise of reforming the police to end the reign of impunity Nigerians have been protesting against for many years. Failure to bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for the torture and killings of #EndSARS protesters on 20 October 2020 is yet another indication that Nigerian authorities lack the political will to ensure accountability for these atrocities, and end police brutality.\u201d\n\nOjigho also stated, \u201cUnder the pretext of restoring order, horrific injuries were inflicted on hundreds of people and at least 56 people were killed, among them dozens of young people lost their lives as Nigerian security forces used unnecessary and excessive force to disperse peaceful protesters across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that despite overwhelming evidence, the government continues to deny the use of live ammunition on protesters at Lekki tollgate exactly a year ago.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International argued that investigative panels set up to look into police brutality had so far been marred by prolonged adjournments, intimidation of witnesses by police lawyers, and failure of police officers to appear as witnesses. It alleged that the panels failed to sit in some states, even as others went on indefinite breaks.\n\nIt called on the authorities to put words into action and decisively end police impunity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022El-Rufai to troops: Let\u2019s sustain momentum\n\n\u2022Says more bandits must be brought to bitter end\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian military, yesterday, pounded bandits in Kaduna forests with helicopter gunships, neutralising 50 and destroying many of their hideouts. The bombing runs were in response to a recent charge by President Muhammadu Buhari to the military to go after bandits and other criminal elements terrorising parts of the country.\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai hailed the renewed onslaught against banditry and kidnapping in the state. El-Rufai appealed to the security forces to sustain the momentum and bring more bandits to their \u201cbitter end\u201d.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs in Kaduna State, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, who disclosed the airstrikes against bandit positions in a statement, said the criminals were neutralised during a combined ground and air assault in the Saulawa-Farin Ruwa axis of Birnin Gwari Local Government Area.\n\nBuhari had on Monday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in the country and declared that their days were numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 30 people in Goronyo market, Sokoto State, by bandits, sent a tough warning to the criminals, declaring, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari stated, in a release by one of his spokesmen, Garba Shehu, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before. The bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nCompetent security sources said the air assaults killed scores of bandits in Saukawa-Farin Ruwa Settlement. This was as Nigerian Army Headquarters said troops killed 24 insurgents in two attacks in the North-east and recovered weapons.\n\nThe bandits in Kaduna, who rode on motorcycles, planned to ambush ground troops at Dogon Dawa and Damari communities in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of the state. But were eliminated in the course of their planning, a military statement claimed.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn continuation of the Kaduna State Multi-Agency Op, the NAF Air Component on 18 Oct 21, provided close air support to ground forces advancing from Dogon Dawa-Damari-Saulawa axis.\n\n\u201cExtensive scan to avert any form of surprise attacks from bandits around the loc led to the interception of armed bandits on 5 x motorcycle 2nm east of Saulawa, staging for a possible ambush on advancing troops. With a good mind of judgment and sincerity of purpose, the helicopter gunship brought the miscreants to their unexpected doom with several precise strikes.\u201d\n\nThe update affirmed, \u201cAfter the neutrlisation of the bandits\u2019 ambush party, armed bandits on about 50 x motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa and were struck effectively with weapons on board. Fleeing bandits within the surrounding forests were followed up and engaged by ground forces.\n\n\u201cIn maintaining presence for an effective annihilation of the bandits, a second helicopter gunship came overhead the location in dogged support of the ground forces.\n\n\u201cSeveral armed bandits were seen scampering to safety in disarray under superior fire power from the ground and air forces, and were hit by the air asset overhead. This led to the effective annihilation of large number of armed bandits\u201d.\n\nCorroborating the military statement, the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs said based on operational feedback to the state government by the Joint Operations Command, \u201cFollowing extensive scans, bandits were spotted on five motorcycles, about 4km east of Saulawa, waiting to ambush the ground forces. They were engaged vigorously by the helicopter gunship, and were wiped out.\n\n\u201cAfter this, armed bandits on about 50 motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa, and were struck effectively by the gunship. Fleeing remnants were mopped up by ground forces.\n\n\u201cA second helicopter gunship joined the operations, and many more fleeing bandits were neutralised by precise strikes. Assessment revealed that more than 50 bandits were neutralised during the joint operation.\u201d\n\nAruwan said El-Rufai expressed satisfaction with the operational feedback and congratulated the ground troops and gunship crews. The governor \u201curged them to sustain the momentum and bring even more bandits to their bitter end,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Army yesterday claimed troops killed 24 insurgents in two attacks in the North-east and recovered weapons. Commander of the anti-insurgency task force, Major General Christopher Musa, told Reuters that soldiers killed 16 Boko Haram insurgents a few kilometres from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.\n\nMusa said during the encounter with the insurgents, two gun trucks were seized and one was destroyed.\n\nArmy spokesman, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, confirmed that late on Monday, troops from a joint Nigerian and Cameroonian operation also killed four ISWAP members, who attacked a forward army base in Borno.\n\nAnother four suspected insurgents died when their truck mounted with anti-aircraft guns drove over an improvised explosive device, Nwachukwu said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects.

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\n#EndSARS: We will not forget 20.10.2020\n\nHow Homefort is assisting customers in avoiding running out of cooking gas\n\nHealthtracka\u2019s admission into Techstars\u2019 Accelerator Programme\n\nBackup\u2019s launch to commemorate 20.10.20\n\n#EndSARS: We will not forget 20.10.2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe #EndSARS protests first began online in Nigeria in 2017 as a cry to denounce police brutality and disband the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nBut, on October 4, 2020, the online protest gained momentum as videos of police brutality circulated on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protest, fueled by a desire for justice in the face of all forms of police brutality, resulted in illegal arrests, physical assaults, and deaths.\n\nTo cater to different needs that arose as protesters increased across the country, African payments startup, Flutterwave \u2014 after making a \u20a62m ($4,400) donation to assist injured people just after the protests began \u2014 started receiving contributions from the public via a link.\n\nHowever, following some threats from the federal government, Feminist Coalition (FemCo), a group of Nigerian feminists, who were at that time aiding the fight, sent out a Providus Bank account number and a Bitcoin address to continue donations.\n\nJack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, also backed the campaign and requested Bitcoin donations to support the movement. Interestingly, the #EndSARS campaign resulted in a surge in cryptocurrency adoption in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, on this day last year, October 20, 2020, several eyewitness accounts reported the shooting of unarmed and peaceful #EndSARS protesters at Lagos\u2019 Lekki Tollgate area. As people attempted to broadcast live, there were reports of network outages in the area. We discussed how this could have been bypassed in this article.\n\nMedia companies were fined for using the footage to cover the protest. Read.\n\nGoogle took down Arise News\u2019s YouTube live stream, and Facebook censored anything #EndSARS; both claimed it was a mistake. Read.\n\nThe Nigerian Army labelled many stories on social media fake news. Read.\n\nAlthough Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State governor, acknowledged Lekki Toll Gate deaths, no one has taken responsibility for what happened. So, who ordered the shootings?\n\nWithout addressing what occurred, in December 2020, the Lagos State government and Eko Innovation Centre organised the Art of Technology (AOT 2.0) to reportedly provide an enabling environment for techpreneurs by ensuring proper broadband Internet penetration.\n\nIn sadness and despair, some saw an opportunity to help, an idea that could save others. Our reporter, Ogheneruemu, talked to one such person. Please, look out for this story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been exactly a year since the Lekki Toll Gate deaths, and after previous backlash, the public continues to question FemCo despite audits demonstrating how the money was disbursed.\n\nToday, we remember those whose lives were cut short, those who were jailed, and every hard-working young person being harassed by the police. And we will not forget how technology, through social media, enabled our voices to be heard.\n\nWe will not forget\u2026\n\nHomefort doesn\u2019t want you to run out of cooking gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the prices of cooking gas in Nigeria continue to rise, Homefort Energy, a clean energy startup, is helping its users purchase cooking gas at a lower price.\n\nThe startup says it replaces users\u2019 existing cylinders with brand new ones at no cost to the customer if the cylinder is less than eight years old.\n\nAlso, Homefort automates gas delivery to homes and businesses using Internet of things-enabled smart metres. It notifies its users whenever their gas is about to run out and schedules a delivery date.\n\nThe company helps users track gas quantity used, gas quantity remaining, consumption, and transaction history.\n\nRead this for context: Nigerian clean energy startup, Homefort Energy, wants to make sure you never have cooking gas worries again\n\nFrom the Intelligence Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian movie industry, mainly financed via public or private funding and international grants, produces the most films in Africa yearly.\n\nThe graph above shows the top ten African countries by estimated annual film productions.\n\nHealthtracka has joined Techstars Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson & Victor Amusan, Healthtracka Co-founders\n\nFor some startups, an accelerator programme might be as important as funding.\n\nAccording to the Business Developing Company (BDC), a bank for Canadian entrepreneurs, a business accelerator is a programme that provides developing companies with mentorship, investors, and other resources to help them become self-sufficient, stable businesses.\n\nWhy accelerator programmes?Apart from the benefits started above, mentors can also provide emotional support, which can be highly beneficial for some startup founders.\n\nSo, who joined an Accelerator programme? Healthtracka, a Nigeria-based healthtech startup decentralising laboratory testing in Africa using at-home tests and digital results, announced on Tuesday, October 19, 2021, that it has joined the Techstars Toronto Accelerator programme.\n\nThe five-month-old company sees its acceptance into the accelerator as validation, and there are some takeaways from the co-founder\u2019s interview with our Reporter, Joy.\n\nPlease, click here to read her interview: African healthtech startup, Healthtracka, gets into Techstars Toronto Accelerator programme\n\nIf you want to know what Healthtracka does, please, read: From death to life: how a loved one\u2019s demise spurred the idea for Healthtracka\n\nAnother one from the Intelligence department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), low-budget movies from Nigeria and other African countries account for most of the films produced annually in Africa.\n\nThe above graph shows the estimated number of films produced annually, private television channels, and cinema screens by African region.\n\nKindly follow Techpoint Intelligence on Twitter, @TechpointIntel, for exciting insights like this.\n\nThe CANS Foundation launches Backup to commemorate 20.10.2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s new?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Nigeria\u2019s gas consumption was 70,000 metric tonnes. However, in 2020, the Nigerian cooking gas market experienced rapid growth, with consumption increasing by 1400% in the last 13 years.\n\nBesides, in June 2021, per Vanguard, a local media platform, the Nigerian Federal Government announced plans to increase the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 5% to 90% in the next ten years.\n\nThis is because the number of users has quadrupled, and the retail network has grown significantly, according to the federal government.\n\nHowever, Opeyemi Owosho, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of clean energy startup, Homefort, says, \u201cthis expansion has resulted in a poor consumer experience in which consumers are unable to monitor the amount of gas remaining in their cylinders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, unexpected gas shortages are a common and recurring issue.\n\n\u201cLikewise, a large number of retailers are unlicensed, and their business practices endanger their immediate surroundings,\u201d Godwin Ogboye, Homefort\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), says.\n\n\u201cLPG marketers are hesitant to invest in new cylinders because they are unable to track the location of their cylinders, resulting in asset loss,\u201d Dapo Oyewumi, Chief Production Officer (CPO), adds.\n\nSo, these three men launched Homefort to address these issues.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom L-R: Godwin Ogboye (CTO), Opeyemi Owosho (CEO), Dapo Oyewumi (CPO); Source: Supplied\n\nBefore co-founding Homefort, Owosho worked for five years in the gas industry at Fitcotech, which creates safety products to improve users\u2019 LPG handling safety.\n\nWhile there, he discovered some gaps in Nigeria\u2019s cooking gas retail market.\n\n\u201cI invited Dapo, whom I met at the General Electric Garage back in 2013, to collaborate on the idea. Dapo persuaded Godwin, an embedded system engineer, to join the team,\u201d Owosho declares.\n\nHe also has a degree in petroleum and gas engineering and has worked in gas safety operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOyewunmi was a former prototype manager at General Electric Garage. He is a hardware product engineer with a wide range of skills.\n\nOgboye was the former CTO of GRICD, a startup that developed a smart cold chain box that actively regulates temperature-sensitive items during transportation and storage. He is an embedded systems engineer who also works as a full-stack developer.\n\nSolving a real problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpeyemi Owosho (CEO); Source: Supplied\n\nHomefort automates gas delivery to homes and businesses using Internet of things-enabled smart metres.\n\n\u201cThese smart metres act as an interface with Homefort\u2019s user app. When a smart metre is connected to a cylinder, the app allows the user to monitor the gas level in real-time,\u201d Owosho explains.\n\nThe company offers digital tools to enterprise customers to help them track the movement and location of their cylinders across the retail value chain.\n\n\u201cOur smart metre\u2019s tamper-proof feature achieves over 95% customer retention by preventing unauthorised retailers from refilling their cylinders,\u201d Owosho says.\n\nFor consumers, Homefort claims its smart metre transmits data about its consumers\u2019 gas usage to Homefort, which allows them to monitor the gas levels in their customers\u2019 cylinders remotely.\n\nHomefort\u2019s web app provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of gas levels in all of its customers\u2019 cylinders. As a result, when a customer runs out of gas, Homefort notifies them and schedules a delivery.\n\n\u201cWe notify and schedule a cylinder swap for customers who are running low on gas. As a result, our customers never run out of gas,\u201d Oyewumi says.\n\nMoreover, barcode tags on Homefort cylinders allow them to track the age and health of the cylinders in real-time. They also receive notifications when cylinders reach their expiration or maintenance dates.\n\nBesides, the company claims that its technology is exclusive to them. Its technology assists LPG marketing companies in increasing customer retention rates by preventing unauthorised retailers from refilling their cylinders, resulting in consumer retention rates of greater than 95%.\n\nIt also helps LPG marketing companies in tracking the location of their cylinders to reduce asset loss.\n\nSetting the pace in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGodwin Ogobye (CTO); Source: Supplied\n\nWhen it comes to LPG companies in Nigeria, Homefort believes that their competitors are still in the development phase, which gives them an early advantage.\n\n\u201cNupe Energy is Homefort\u2019s main competitor. However, as of now, they are not yet operational. Their product\u2019s hardware is complete, but they are still working on the software,\u201d Owosho clarifies.\n\n\u201cThere are competitors operating in East Africa, with two of them planning to expand into Nigeria, which I believe is a good thing because more competition leads to a faster consumer education curve,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nOverall, Homefort believes that its competitive advantage stems from the team\u2019s unique skill set and in-depth knowledge of the industry.\n\nA model that works\n\nHomefort generates revenue from annual subscription fees and gas sales.\n\nThe Homefort app allows users to access the company\u2019s services. To gain access to Homefort, users must first install the Homefort app, available for both Android and iOS systems.\n\nUsers pay a \u20a620,000 ($48.59) annual subscription fee, which covers the costs of smart metre access, gas delivery, and cylinder maintenance.\n\nAlso, Homefort replaces a new user\u2019s existing cylinder with a brand new cylinder at no cost if the age of the existing cylinder is less than eight years post-production.\n\n\u201cThe expiration time for LPG cylinders is between 8-10 years. While most new users who switch to Homefort already have existing cylinders, we replace their existing cylinders with brand new cylinders from Homefort at no cost if the age of the existing cylinder is less than eight years,\u201d Oyewumi submits.\n\nNew users who do not have cylinders or whose cylinders are more than eight years old must purchase Homefort cylinders.\n\n\u201cOur gas is typically 5% less expensive than that of roadside convenience stores. We make a 30% profit on every 12kg of gas we supply to our customers,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nUsers can use the app to track gas quantity used, gas quantity remaining, consumption, and transaction history. This feature is available and accessible to paid subscribers.\n\nSteady growth in a challenging economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDapo Oyewumi (CPO); Source: Supplied\n\nIn June 2021, Homefort raised a pre-seed round of $100,000 to help the company recruit its first hundred users. Idris Bello invested in the round.\n\nAlso, the company received $70,000 from All-on, the Nigeria Content and Monitoring Board, and Fate Foundation.\n\nEven though Homefort is barely 11 months old, the company has over 120 monthly active users. Also, in the last four months, its monthly user base has increased by 500%.\n\n\u201cWe have a long and growing waitlist of about 1,050 users. And our growth strategy is very enterprising; by December 2022, we plan to grow our user base to 5,000 per month,\u201d Owosho says.\n\nAccording to Oyewunmi, every member of the team, which has grown from 3 to 12, is wholly committed to the product\u2019s success.\n\nSome components of Homefort\u2019s smart metre are sourced from China and the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar has significantly impacted the company.\n\nHowever, it has begun reverse-engineering some of the components they import from China to reduce their reliance on dollars for component procurement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve begun reverse-engineering some of the components we import. By June 2022, we hope to have 70% of components sourced locally,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nIn the last two years, both funders and the media have increased their focus on energy tech startups that focus on clean and renewable energy.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem is rapidly expanding. There is, in my opinion, no better time to be a founder than right now. The ecosystem\u2019s support from experienced founders is incredible,\u201d concludes Owosho.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthtracka, a Nigeria-based healthtech startup decentralised laboratory testing in Africa by providing at-home tests and digital results, has announced joining the Techstars Toronto Accelerator programme.\n\nThe three-month-long scheme will provide direct mentorship, funding, and access to a global network for the platform. The five-month-old startup will be joining 11 other startups in this cohort.\n\nLast week, we d\u00edd a feature on the startup. We discussed the inspiration behind the idea, starting and scaling in the ecosystem as a first-time female founder, foraying into the southwestern city of Ibadan, and much more.\n\nIn a follow-up conversation with the founder, \u00ccf\u1eb9ol\u00f9w\u00e0 Dare-Johnson, she discusses what a place in the Techstars Toronto means for Healthtracka, how she gauged the timing for applying to an accelerator and plans following the startup\u2019s time at the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it feel to get into Techstars Toronto?\n\nWe feel very validated. The problem we have set out to solve, poor access to laboratory tests, is one that we\u2019ve always known to be worth solving. Seeing a global accelerator like Techstars also identifying with us and backing us is exciting. It gives us a lot more motivation to make things work.\n\nHealthtracka is five months old; why apply to an accelerator?\n\nFor early-stage startups, and especially for a first-time founder like myself, there comes a time when you just want to ensure that you\u2019re building the right way. Why go through the mistakes those ahead of you made when you can learn from them? Accelerator programmes are opportunities to refine your ideas and processes through the right lenses.\n\nWould you recommend this move to other founders, and why?\n\nOh, yes, absolutely. I will recommend that every founder joins a global accelerator for the sake of themselves and their companies. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely excruciating journey, especially at the early stage, and being a part of a great accelerator programme is extremely valuable. Accelerators like Techstars are curated specifically to equip founders as they build and grow their early-stage startup companies.\n\nWhat was the attraction to Techstars?\n\nTheir reputation over the years. And as they say, Techstars is like the Havard of the ecosystem. They\u2019ve backed early-stage companies that have gone on to become Unicorns, so we recognised that they have \u00edntegrity. And of course, Techstars Toronto because I have spoken to Sunil, and I see how passionate he is about helping early-stage startups get to the next level. It is an opportunity to work with and learn from outstanding mentors and leverage their experience, skills, and network to create a platform where all Africans have access to at-home lab testing.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after the Techstars programme?\n\nOne of our key goals involves doubling our customer base, and we expect that from a numbers perspective, we can increase the number of tests carried out and our customer acquisition. We also hope that we have increased access to global opportunities and stakeholders, given the reputation of Techstars, which we\u2019re looking to ride on to make bigger moves.\n\nCan we expect Healthtracka\u2019s expansion into the Canadian market?\n\nAt this point, there\u2019s nothing out of the picture; we can think globally. If we decide to expand into Canada, Techstars has the resources to ensure that we have all the support that we need. There\u2019s a part of Techstars that is called Mentor Madness; it\u2019s basically back-to-back meetings with great mentors. There\u2019s just a lot in store for us following our time in the accelerator, and this is opening our minds to possibilities.\n\nWhat are your Africa expansion plans?\n\nWe\u2019re currently present in two Nigerian cities, and we\u2019re looking to expand across Nigeria and then into other African countries. The good thing about our model is that it\u2019s asset-light, so we\u2019re agile and can move fast. Beyond that, one of the things that makes us so proud is our impact. We\u2019re adding more years to people\u2019s lives by bringing the lab closer to them. Also, the fact that we\u2019re providing more jobs as we expand is something we\u2019re proud of.\n\nDo you think that healthtech is an attractive industry for investors?\n\nWell, fintech is booming right now in Africa. But then, my principle is to always look at the future. It\u2019s easy to say healthtech isn\u2019t getting as much investment, but a few years ago, when eCommerce seemed to be getting all the funding, some people were insightful enough to say fintech was the next big thing. And now, the truth is healthtech is the next big thing, especially in Africa, where various challenges require innovative solutions. And as these solutions are built, investors will see a lot more of these opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthtracka joins Nigerian startups like TalentQL, Quidax, and Treepz (formerly Plentywaka) in the Techstars Toronto portfolio.\n\nAccording to Sunil Sharma, Managing Director of Techstars Toronto, the nature of the problem that Healthtracka is looking to solve was a major attraction.\n\n\u201cAccessing healthcare in a timely manner is critical to protecting health. This is something that we immediately imagined as a serious problem in Africa with massive populations and crowded healthcare settings combined with gridlock traffic and low doctor-to-population ratios.\u201d\n\nRecognising the urgency of the problem, Sharma says that the issue of delayed access to healthcare services is not faced by Africans alone, so it was necessary to bring the team onboard.\n\n\u201cDespite being a more developed nation, Canadians also face long delays in laboratories and clinics, which can lead to testing delays or avoidance altogether. I could only imagine that if this is a problem here, it must be even more acute in Africa. When we met Ifeoluwa and Victor, we knew immediately that this was the team to back.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2006, Techstars is a seed accelerator that helps budding companies with human and financial resources, from mentors to funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "#EndSARS: Nigeria yet to pick up from ruins of protest\n\nBusinesses are yet to recover and public infrastructure are still ruined after they were razed during nationwide #ENDSARS protests against the unpopular and now disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) one year ago.\n\nAs youths took to the streets in Lagos and Abuja to mark the anniversary of the protest to demand an end to police brutality, small business owners are still reeling in pain. Lagos, the hotspot of the protests, is yet to rebuild police stations or replace transport infrastructure destroyed during the demonstrations.\n\nFinancial Derivatives Company, an advisory firm, estimates the economic cost of the #EndSARS protest disruption at N1.5 trillion, about 11.47 percent of the 2021 budget.\n\nLagos transportation suffered a setback with the burning of mass transit buses known as BRT, which are yet to be replaced.\n\nAccording to Lagos State commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotosho, a total of 80 BRT vehicles were destroyed, made up of 23 big buses and 57 medium-size buses, noting that 57 of the 80 buses were at the Oyingbo Terminus.\n\nHe said while the big buses cost around $200,000 each, the medium-size buses cost around $100,000 each. With the exchange at the time of the incident, the 80 destroyed BRT buses were valued at N3.9 billion.\n\nSmall businesses, most of which are in Lagos, were not spared.\n\nRead Also: EndSARS protests: How best to mitigate future losses\n\nAlmost one in three businesses in Lagos lost between N500,000 and N1 million while 14 percent lost between N150,000 and 500,000; 14 percent lost less than N150,000, according to a report by SBM Intelligence.\n\nHowever, over 10,000 small businesses affected by last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests have received a total of N939 million support from the Lagos State government.\n\nThe economic cost of the looting and destruction that engulfed Nigeria was a setback on its fragile economy, The protest coincided with the coronavirus pandemic, the effects of which Africa\u2019s biggest economy is yet to recover from and thus compounding its economic woes.\n\nThe two-week long protest against police brutality was initially peaceful until hoodlums hijacked it and went on to loot and destroy properties running into billions.\n\nAt a virtual meeting with commissioners of police in the 36 states and FCT on October 30, 2020, the former Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, disclosed that 71 public warehouses and 248 privately owned stores were looted in the course of the protests in 13 states and the FCT.\n\nThe states were Lagos, Edo, Delta, Oyo, Kano, Plateau, Osun, Ondo, Ogun, Rivers, Abia, Imo, and Ekiti states, and the FCT.\n\nThis was obtained from statistics collated between October 11 and 27, 2020, after the #EndSARS protest spread across the country.\n\nAccording to the police boss, the affected states recorded major violence leading to attacks on critical national security infrastructure and other corporate and private properties as well as injuries on civilians, the police and other security agents.\n\nAdamu said 205 critical national security assets, corporate facilities and private property were attacked, burnt and vandalised.\n\nIn a recent BusinessDay\u2019s inspection, several of the burnt police stations and other public infrastructure are still not fully built.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of destruction of public and private property and these cost a lot of money. We are talking of hundreds of millions of naira,\u201d Muda Yusuf, former director-general, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), told journalists two days ago.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you, many of the private sector investors that were affected are yet to recover from the shock and the setback caused by the destruction. There were also a lot of public properties that were destroyed, which also cost billions of naira,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nLooting and vandalism occurred at several shopping malls in Lagos, including The Palms Mall, Circle Mall, Montaigne Mall, Lagos City Mall, the razing of the Lekki Toll Gate and many others.\n\nSome state properties were also torched and destroyed in the state in the wake of the protest, such as the Nigeria Ports Authority, BRT Terminal, Oyingbo, with several buses set on fire.\n\nOthers are Television Continental (TVC), Ketu, VIO, FRSC Office, Ojodu, with FRSC branded cars and generators burnt, palace of Oba of Lagos, Sanwo Olu mother\u2019s house, Surulere, three bank branches, Ajeromi Local Government secretariat, Lagos-Island Local Government secretariat, the Nation Newspapers building, among several others.\n\nThe government is yet to fix other ravaged properties amid rising debt.\n\nYusuf Othman, president, Nigerian Association of Road Transport Organisation (NARTO), recently complained that it was yet to receive compensation for losses incurred during last year\u2019s protest as the organisation lost over N2 billion as trucks were burnt.\n\nThe Nigerian government will borrow N5.012 trillion to finance its budget deficit in 2022. The government proposed a N16.39 trillion budget for next year, which comes with a deficit of N6.258 trillion.",

          "text": "As foreign exchange pressure persists, some Nigerian banks have increased dollar charges by 45.15 percent per dollar, an affected customer told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cI performed a dollar transaction on my Globus account last month, I was charged N601 to a dollar. Then yesterday (last Friday) I tried again and I was charged N595.08 to a dollar. There is no prompt to let you know that\u2019s the rate you will be charged,\u201d the customer said.\n\nThis implies that the bank charged an average rate of N598.04k per dollar compared with N412 the banks are supposed to charge after buying from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at N410 per dollar.\n\nOther banks that increased their exchange rates are Access Bank, which rate stood at N450 per dollar as of October 13, 2021, UBA rate at (N465/$), Ecobank (N450/$), Wema Bank (N461/$), and FCMB (N480/$).\n\nOthers include Sterling Bank (N460/$), Standard Chartered Bank (N463/$), and Union Bank rate has remained unchanged at N412/$.\n\nThe customer, who is a young mother working in a corporate organisation in Lagos, said, \u201cUntil you get the debit alert before you know how much they charged to a dollar. Both transactions I performed were $100 and I was charged at that rate in September and October, respectively.\u201d\n\nShe said she contacted her account officer who told her that the charges were due to the volatility in the dollar.\n\nRead also: Nigerian banks tap dollar debt ahead of Basel III\n\nReacting to the development, Uche Uwaleke, a professor at the department of banking and finance, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, said, \u201cThat is outrageous. Something wrong must be going on there. I expect the bank customers to report to the Banking Supervision Department of the CBN.\u201d\n\nUwaleke said for the CBN\u2019s forex management policies to succeed, the banks need to be closely monitored, especially now that the sale of forex to BDCs had been suspended.\n\nFollowing the stoppage of dollar sales to the Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in July 2021 by the CBN, the Body of Bank Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) said naira-dollar exchange rate, which fell to as low as N527/$ per dollar in the same month, would recover to at least N423 per dollar, but this has not happened.\n\nThe banks\u2019 CEOs in a zoom press conference said they had the infrastructure and the capacity to meet the legitimate foreign exchange demand of the end users. Such legitimate needs include Business Travel Allowance (BTA), Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), school fees and medicals.\n\nHerbert Wigwe, chairman of the Body of Bank CEOs, said banks were doing everything necessary to avoid abuse of foreign exchange, saying the process would be centralised for better service delivery.\n\n\u201cDifferent banks are going to have different processes because you will have to look at your controls, you will have to look at what works for you. There is a lot of abuse around foreign exchange, so we might find that to better control this you might want to decentralise or centralise or a combination of the two,\u201d Segun Agbaje, group CEO of GTCO plc, said.",

          "text": "The National Economic Council (NEC), comprising all State Governors and representatives of the Federal Government, and chaired by the vice president, has called on the leadership of the security agencies to ensure that persons that are recruited into arms-bearing security agencies undergo psychiatric evaluations and drug tests before enlistment.\n\nSuch recruits would also be made to undergo periodic checks after enlistment. This is to ensure that they are psychologically fit to carry live weapons and to identify behavioural tendencies that may require psycho-social interventions.\n\nNEC also warns that the personnel of the agencies should dutifully observe Rules of Engagement in the discharge of their duties around and within the civilian populace.\n\nThe Council further wants all those detained by the Police as a result of the EndSars protests to be expeditiously processed with due regard to the principles of fair hearing.\n\nThis comes as Nigerian youths mark the first anniversary of the alleged October 20, 2020 \u2018Lekki Massacre\u2019 which government vehemently insists did not happen during youths\u2019 protest against police brutality in the country \u2013 popularly called #EndSars protest.\n\nThe NEC, had, during its meeting on 15 October 2021, received an update on the Reports of Judicial Panels of Inquiry into Allegations of Human Rights Violations against Members of Nigeria Police Force and other Security Agencies.\n\nRead also: No proof any protester was killed at Lekki Toll Gate, says FG\n\nTwenty-eight states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) \u2013 under the auspices of the National Human Rights Commission \u2013 had set up Judicial Panels/Commissions of Inquiry to investigate allegations of violations of human rights levied against members of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies, especially members of the disbanded SARS.Out of the 28 States, 11 States \u2013 including Abia, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Plateau, and Rivers have submitted their final reports to Council.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Wednesday, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed said, the NEC resolutions followed deliberations and recommendations on the reports, and that the remaining state Governors have also assured to submit their reports soon.\n\nThe minister insisted that to date, there has been no proof of any killing at the Lekki Toll Gate during the EndSARS protest and that the military did not shoot at protesters there as widely alleged.\n\n\u201cThe only massacre recorded was in the social media, hence there were neither bodies nor blood,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said \u201cOne year later, and despite ample opportunities for the families of those allegedly killed and those alleging a massacre to present evidence, there has been none: No bodies, no families, no convincing evidence, nothing. Where are the families of those who were reportedly killed at the toll gate? Did they show up at the Judicial Panel of Inquiry? If not, why?\u201d\n\nHe said as resolved by NEC, a number of states have set up Victims Compensation Funds, from which several #Endsars victims have already received payments of monetary compensations awarded to them by the panels. The Council directed State Governors to immediately forward copies of final reports of the panels to their Attorneys-General for prompt arraignment and prosecution of all indicted persons.\n\nWhere incidents in the reports relate to matters of discipline, in addition to prosecution, NEC urged the Nigeria Police Force to take disciplinary action on the affected officers in line with the provisions of the Police Act 2020.\n\nWhile acknowledging the various initiatives introduced by the Federal Government to strengthen police accountability through the Police Service Commission, sustain improved funding and budgetary allocation to the Nigeria Police Force and other securities agencies, and the lifting of the ban on recruitment of police officers, the Council urged the Federal Government to give priority to the general welfare of police officers and personnel of other security agencies.\n\n\u201cIn particular, it advocated the review of pension and gratuity of retired police officers and attainment of parity of remuneration by police officers with sister security agencies,\u201d the Minister added.\n\nNEC further called on the leadership of the security agencies to undertake a comprehensive assessment of all police stations across the country to ensure that they are fit for purpose and urged the Police Force and security agencies to deploy cutting-edge technology in the fight against crimes.\n\nThe Police should also, in line with the mandatory training provisions of the Police Act 2020, prioritise the training of Police Officers on procedures for the entrenchment of Human Rights Provisions guaranteed by the Constitution and on the professional handling of weapons.\n\nIt should also ensure that the system established within the Force for receipt and handling of complaints or petitions is strengthened, and all police officers on duty should be in police-approved uniform with their full names and force numbers boldly written for easy identification.\n\n\u201cThe States should, as resolved by NEC: Properly utilize and support the community policing programme of the Federal Government, with active collaborative efforts and participation of traditional rulers, elders, youths, vigilante groups, etc.;\n\n\u201cEstablish standing committees under States Ministries of Justice to address human rights violations on a continuous basis; and take measures aimed at flushing out miscreants squatting in uncompleted buildings, and other blackout spots that serve as hideouts for criminals,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nHe said while appreciating the role of lawful peaceful protests in the advancement of public discourse under democratic governance, the NEC strongly advised those planning public protests across the country to mark the EndSARS\u2019 anniversary to consider other lawful alternative means of engagement.\n\nThis, he said is especially because of the current security situation across the country and fear the possibility of such protests being hijacked by armed hoodlums and other opportunistic criminals to cause mayhem.\n\nOn continued police brutality and molestation, Mohammed said the police reform is a process and that \u201cwhat\u2019s important is government\u2019s commitment to dealing with the genuine issues and concluding the reforms.\u201d",

The FPIC law will also let them know the role of government and what it will do to back their investment in terms of profitability as no investors will be able to cut corners when it comes to investment in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe laws will enable communities to have the opportunity and platform to negotiate, make their demand from the investors and have a seamless process through the investment.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director of Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO), Kelvin Uwaibi said the workshop is necessary to create harmonization between communities, government, and investors to ensure economic development in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe really want to have a situation where the communities, local and state governments will work in harmony, as stipulated in the FPIC documents.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), has restated is commitment to assisting the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in promoting the stability of the banking system.\n\nMr. Bello Hassan, Managing Director/Chief Executive of NDIC, who made the commitment in his remarks at the opening ceremony of the 8th edition of the workshop for business editors and Finance correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN), held on Wednesday, also said the corporation will to provide realistic terms and conditions that will enable qualifying insured financial institution promptly access technical and or financial support, in line with S.(2)(1)(b) of the NDIC Act, whilst also protecting the Corporation from possible downside risks.\n\n\u201cPermit me to reiterate the determination of the current management of the NDIC, to work harmoniously with all stakeholders, to enhance the capacity of the Corporation in the discharge of its statutory obligations towards the fulfilment of the public policy objectives for which it was established,\u201d Hassan said.\n\n\u201cOur key focus is therefore to scale up the deposit insurance framework; provide timely support to insured institutions as and when required; ensure faster and orderly resolutions of liquidated insured institutions; as well as continue to assist the Central Bank in promoting the stability of the banking system\n\n\u201cIn the area of Deposit Insurance, as a key mandate of the Corporation, we have evolved a strategy which accentuates our existing framework. The initiative, strives to ensure that the insurance cover is adequate to support this objective within the banking sector. In addition, considering the importance of the optimum Funding Ratio in deposit insurance, we are developing an effective methodology for determining a realistic Target Funding Ratio for the Corporation. Additionally, we have commenced the review of our approach to the determination of premium by banks to make it more risk-based, such that, the probability of the risk crystallizing, becomes a major factor in the pricing methodology of our premium going forward.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there have been recent calls on the Corporation to enhance the provision of support, to insured institutions that are facing financial difficulties. To this end, we have identified the need to reconsider our framework, to provide realistic terms and conditions that will enable qualifying insured financial institution promptly access technical and or financial support, in line with S.(2)(1)(b) of the NDIC Act, whilst also protecting the Corporation from possible downside risks.\n\n\u201cWe are equally collaborating with relevant stakeholders, to ensure that the Corporation discharges its responsibilities efficiently without hindrances, following revocation of licenses of any insured institution by the CBN. This has become more important to us, giving the need to improve on our processes in resolving liquidated financial institutions. Some of the obstacles bedeviling the efficient and timely resolutions of liquidated institutions, such as slow recovery and realization of assets, as well as litigation by erstwhile shareholders and creditors of closed banks can only be addressed through effective collaboration.\n\n\u201cIn all these collaborative efforts, the media, the civil society groups, along with the insured financial institutions that are represented at this workshop, will remain the most strategic and critical stakeholders that we cherish the most. Through the better understanding of our programmes and policies, it is hoped that you will not only be better informed in the coverage of our activities, but also be well-equipped to contribute to our advocacy and mobilization for a resilient financial system. I therefore call on you, to continue to support the Corporation in its resolve to fully deliver on its core mandates. On our part, we promise to keep our doors open to your suggestions and observations, while partnering with you on capacity building and other areas of mutual benefit.\u201d",

The sectors are Health, Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy and Transportation.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) project is being undertaken in Lagos, Nigeria following the official nod received from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission and the relevant agency of the Lagos State Government; and an Agreement signed between Sterling Bank and PriVida Power Limited, a Nigerian-based international energy company. The specialized BIPV panels will be supplied by Onyx Solar, a solar energy company founded in \u00c1vila, Spain, and a global leader in the manufacturing of transparent photovoltaic (PV) glass for buildings.\u201d\n\nAccording to Omozaphua Akalumhe, a Director of PriVida Power Limited, \u201cPriVida and its partners are proud to work with Sterling Bank in delivering this signature Solarization Project, deploying Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) solution. We are confident that Sterling Bank has taken the right step in strengthening its position as the undisputed Leader in promoting Renewable Energy (RE) deployment in Nigeria through this project.\u201d\n\nFaseemo also remarked that 3E, a South Africa-based independent technical advisor for Sterling Bank, has reviewed the design proposed by the EPC Contractor and included the assessment of the site, the verification of the contractor energy audit, the long-term energy yield assessment and the review of the financial model.\n\n\u201c3E\u2019s scope was, in other words, to check that the proposed designs were fit for purpose, and that the key technical and financial risks have been taken into account and sufficiently mitigated; to ensure that the project proposal is in line with the Bank\u2019s expectations and objectives,\u201d Faseemo noted.\n\nOnyx Solar said it has installed PV glasses on many skyscrapers in Singapore, convention centres in Canada and tourist attractions in Dubai in addition to railway stations in the US, hospitals in Norway, banks in Kenya, embassies in Indonesia, shopping malls in Mexico and universities and colleges in Australia.\n\nFaseemo explained that as a result of the integration, Sterling Bank will become a reference for modernity and sustainability in the country, adding that the installation will supply just below 1MW of installed power, which will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and its ecological footprint as well as demonstrate the Bank\u2019s commitment to environment sustainability and the development of renewable energy in the country.",

Funds are not coming, taxes are not paid, there is no consumer satisfaction, there is no feedback, it\u2019s completely disoriented right now. And with the fact that ACFTA is coming soon, in order for us to compete properly, we need to have a regulated road transportation system for commercial operators, which now comes to the manufacturers. With the ACFTA coming, this morning it came out that we have a lot substandard vehicles on the roads. I know that Lome and Cotonou have complained that the vehicles in Nigeria are below standard. Of the 76000 trucks registered supposedly only 17 meet the standard.\n\nEarlier, Agwu reeled the problems bedeviling the sector describing the nation\u2019s auto industry as an orphan that is being over used even though it accounts for 15% of those working in the country.\n\nThe BKG boss lamented that the auto sector is under heavy stress which affects Nigerians in terms of cost of transportation, lack of safety in movement of good and services due to bad vehicles.\n\nAccording to Agwu, policy inconsistency is one problem that have cost the auto sector a whole lot of money.\n\n\u201cCompanies set up factories to assemble with billions of Naira and the next thing you see is they change the policy and said you can bring in whatever you want. Where does that work? And that is why serious companies actually do not come to Nigeria.\u201d.\n\nHe further decried the skyrocketing exchange rate of the Naira to the dollar, stressing that the amount of money used in buying a car in Nigeria currently was what used to build a house all because of the exchange rate.\n\n\u201cA full Option Toyota Corolla that was a little above N3 million is currently 18 million. Big problem! Worse still, it is only in Nigeria that if one wants to buy a car the person will come with the whole money\u201d.\n\nHe urged the ministry to also persuade the state ministries of transportation to come and witness the motor fair and see what is obtainable in the local market, regretting that some states go abroad to buy mass transit vehicles to the detriment of investors who have set up factories for assembling vehicles.",

If you look at it, it is a very heavy mandate. We have about 3.1million out of school children with disabilities that do not want to go to school. This requires our collective efforts to actualise this.\u201d\n\nThe NCPWD boss assured that, the curriculum when developed, would go through the appropriate authorities for proper implementation.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to share story, we are not here to share experience, but we are here to gather all the experiences we have over time, put them on paper so that we can develop curriculum and forward to the regulatory bodies,\u201d said Lalu.\n\nThe ES said about six Vice Chancellors of the Federal Universities have shown interest and passion for inclusion of PWDs in their institutions, adding that the developed curriculum will reflect in both the Nigerian colleges of education, polytechnics, and universities.\n\nHe disclosed the Commission\u2019s resolve to offer special scholarships for Persons with Disabilities in schools, adding that the scholarship will not start from Tertiary institutions but, right from the primary, secondary and to the Tertiary.\n\nWhile speaking on the effort made so far, Lalu said NCPWD is working with the Education Ministry to ensure that every federal school is open for free education for PWDs.\n\nThe Commission, according to him, has secured perfect partnership with the Nigerian Police Force to enforce the right to education of people with disabilities.\n\nHe said the commission will soon launch digital application that will help PWDs to widen their capacity.\n\nLalu, therefore, called on the relevant authorities to partner with the commission to actualise it\u2019s objectives.\n\nAlso, the National President, Association of the blind, Ishika Adamu said the curriculum will help close the gap in accessing Tertiary education for PWDs.",

We must never forget.\u201d\n\nBoth celebrities had, however, appealed to persons interested in the procession to stay guided and stay in their vehicles throughout the parade, as well as in groups for safety reasons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rolling up in cars tomorrow (Wednesday) to drive through the tollgate. We know their way, so a procession of cars is the safest option to minimize police harassment. We will stay in our vehicles throughout.\u201d\n\nThe police later reviewed their position on protest, saying they would only allow indoor and virtual events.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Hakeem Odumosu, also cautioned residents, especially the youth against embarking on any form of protest without the approval of the police.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go on vehicular procession, okay. They are not going to stop somewhere, come down somewhere and converge somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201c(I) want the criminally minded people to know that the police are up to take care of them.\u201d",

          "text": "A former student pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing 17 people in a shooting rampage at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and apologized in court to relatives of the victims.\n\nNikolas Cruz, who was 19 at the time, took a legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, his former school, on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2018 and killed 17 students and staff members.\n\nCruz pleaded guilty to 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder for those wounded during the attack, which sparked a student-led movement for tighter gun control laws.\n\nCruz, who was dressed in a blue collared shirt and sweater vest and wearing large glasses and a face mask, responded \u201cguilty\u201d as Judge Elizabeth Scherer read off each of the charges in a Fort Lauderdale courthouse.\n\nHe told the judge he was suffering from a \u201clittle anxiety\u201d but understood the charges against him and was pleading guilty of his own volition.\n\nCruz will now go before a jury for the penalty phase of the trial. He faces a minimum of life in prison without parole but prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty.\n\nThe judge set January 4, 2022 for the start of jury selection for the penalty phase.\n\nFollowing his guilty pleas, Cruz, who is now 23, apologized to the relatives of his victims.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry for what I did and I have to live with it every day,\u201d he said, reading from a prepared statement. \u201cIt brings me nightmares.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were to get a second chance I would do everything in my power to try to help others,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing relatives of the victims, Cruz said: \u201cI believe it\u2019s your decision to decide where I go, whether I live or die, not the jury\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRelatives of some of the victims were among the spectators in the courtroom and wiped away tears as a prosecutor recounted the attack in chilling detail.\n\nMental health problems\n\nThe shooting was the worst school massacre in the United States since the horror at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, which left 26 dead.\n\nThe Florida shooting stunned the country and sparked new efforts, led by students from the school itself, for tougher gun control \u2014 although the polarized US Congress has yet to enact meaningful gun reform.\n\nA rally organized by Stoneman Douglas students, \u201cMarch for Our Lives,\u201d drew hundreds of thousands to the nation\u2019s capital in March 2018.\n\nPresident Joe Biden marked the third anniversary of the Parkland shooting in February with a call on Congress to enact \u201ccommonsense\u201d gun law reforms.\n\n\u201cThis administration will not wait for the next mass shooting to heed that call,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe will take action to end our epidemic of gun violence and make our schools and communities safer.\u201d\n\nBiden said he wants Congress to pass laws that would require background checks on all gun sales and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\n\u201cThe time to act is now,\u201d he said,\n\nCruz bought the weapon legally, despite having been in local records as having a history of mental health problems.\n\nExpelled from school for disciplinary reasons, Cruz was known to be fixated on firearms \u2014 and had reportedly been identified as a potential threat to his classmates.\n\nThe FBI confirmed it was alerted several months before the attack to a message posted on YouTube, in which a user named Nikolas Cruz vowed: \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the attack Cruz arrived at the school in an Uber, began shooting indiscriminately at students and staff, and fled nine minutes later, leaving behind a scene of carnage.\n\nHe was arrested nearby shortly afterwards.\n\nFootage recovered from his phone showed he had filmed his plans to attack his former school, saying his goal was to kill \u201cat least 20 people.\u201d\n\nCruz told a detective after his arrest that he heard demons ordering him to \u201cbuy weapons, kill animals and destroy everything.\u201d\n\nAFP",

It posted photographs of what appeared to be plumes of billowing smoke.\n\nA humanitarian source in Mekelle told Reuters news agency the air raid was in 05 Kebelle, an area near a cement factory on the city\u2019s outskirts. Separately, the AFP news agency quoted a Mekelle resident as saying that an industrial site had been destroyed in the air raid.\n\n\u201cIt was heavy and the jet was so close,\u201d the resident said. \u201cIt has burned the whole compound. We don\u2019t know the casualties but now the whole company is burned to ash.\u201d\n\nThe attack came two days after Ethiopia\u2019s air force confirmed air raids in Mekelle that a witness said killed three children. The air force said communications towers and equipment were attacked.\n\nMekelle had not seen fighting since June, when Tigrayan forces retook much of the region in a dramatic turn in the war. Since then, fighting has intensified in two other Ethiopian regions \u2013 Amhara and Afar \u2013 where the federal government\u2019s military is trying to recover territory taken by the TPLF.\n\nInternational pleas to stop the fighting, which has so far killed thousands of people and forced more than two million to flee their homes, have failed.",

The case dates back to June 2015, when the two footballers were at a France training camp.\n\nThe saga rocked French football and both players lost their team places.\n\nKarim Benzema, 33, has since returned to the France team and scored in Real Madrid\u2019s victory in Kyiv on Tuesday in the Uefa Champions League.\n\nHe is on trial with four other men accused of trying to blackmail Mr Valbuena, who told the court on Wednesday that football was his life.\n\n\u201cI knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sex tape case began in 2015 when Mr Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device.\n\nMr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone, and he and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, are then accused of trying to blackmail Mr Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public.\n\nMr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money.\n\nMathieu Valbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who then told the court the player was acting as if nothing was wrong and he had warned him of the seriousness of the issue, without asking for money.\n\nWhen the footballer went to the police, an undercover agent named Luka was given the task of negotiating on his behalf.\n\nThe defendants are accused of approaching a childhood friend of Mr Benzema called Karim Zenati.\n\nThen in October 2015 the Real Madrid striker approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team\u2019s training camp.\n\nMr Benzema said he had merely tried to help his team-mate get rid of the compromising video, warning him: \u201cBe careful, Math, they\u2019re big, big thugs.\u201d\n\nHe then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust \u2013 his childhood friend, Mr Zenati.\n\nPolice were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Mr Benzema telling his childhood friend: \u201cHe\u2019s not taking us seriously.\u201d\n\nMr Zenati is said to have replied: \u201cWe\u2019re here to sort it out; if he doesn\u2019t want that he\u2019ll have to deal with the piranhas.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Valbuena is said to have already told his family about the footage on his phone.\n\nGiving evidence at the start of the trial, Mathieu Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out.\n\nThe defence lawyers have already argued that police were wrong to use an undercover agent and that the agent pushed the defendants to demand money. But French courts threw out the lawyers\u2019 objections to police methods in 2018.\n\nThe trial will continue until the end of the week, with four defendants facing charges of attempted blackmail and Karim Benzema accused of complicity.\n\nThe maximum sentence for complicity in attempted blackmail is five years in jail and a \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000) fine.",

I wish everyone the very best of luck for the rest of this season and beyond.\u201d\n\nBruce had a 27.4% win percentage from 84 league games at Newcastle, which was the ninth best compared to previous Magpies managers who had been in charge of at least 20 Premier League matches.\n\nA Newcastle statement said the club \u201cwould like to place on record its gratitude to Steve for his contribution and wishes him well for the future\u201d.\n\nThe club\u2019s next game will be at Crystal Palace at 1500 BST on Saturday, 23 October.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Bruce said: \u201cI think this might be my last job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about me; it\u2019s taken its toll on my whole family because they are all Geordies and I can\u2019t ignore that.\n\n\u201cThey have been worried about me\u2026 especially my wife Jan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 60 years old and I don\u2019t know if I want to put her through it again. We\u2019ve got a good life so, yeah, this will probably be me done as a manager \u2013 until I get a phone call from a chairman somewhere asking if I can give them a hand. Never say never, I\u2019ve learnt that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI wanted so badly to make it work.\n\n\u201cI was so proud to be manager of Newcastle United, even in the dark times, I was determined to keep going and to keep this club in the Premier League.\u201d\n\nBruce\u2019s appointment under former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was met with criticism from fans and he has failed to win them over during his time on Tyneside.\n\nDuring his final game against Spurs, some Magpies fans sang, \u2018We want Brucey out\u2019 as they made the new owners aware about their feelings about his position.\n\n\u201cFantastic news, I think every single Newcastle United fan is over the moon with this,\u201d supporter Alex Hurst from The True Faith podcast told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, arguably it should have happened at least a week earlier but I think we\u2019re not going to worry too much about that now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new era for the football club and it was essential that Steve Bruce was moved on.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNo wins this season and, quite simply, if you look at Steve Bruce\u2019s record this season but also over the last 38 games as a whole, I think they\u2019ve won seven of those 38 games, very few football managers in any division in any country would be able to survive that sort of record.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, I think he was yesterday\u2019s man. He might have been a good manager 28 years ago but he\u2019s not any more.\u201d\n\nIt was always Steve Bruce\u2019s dream job to take charge of Newcastle United but he has received a lot of criticism from the supporters, a lot of abuse which I know he feels has gone too far at times.\n\nI think he is a realist. He would have said the takeover from a footballing sense is the best thing for Newcastle United Football Club in terms of the investment it will undoubtedly bring.\n\nI think he is also a realist in that he knew that it would probably mean that they\u2019d want to bring in their own manager and I think in that sense what will be, will be.\n\nYes he\u2019ll be disappointed, any manager would be to lose his job, but I think when he reflects there might be an element of relief as well because of the criticism and abuse that he has received, that he\u2019s no longer in the firing line.\n\nIt became quite clear at the weekend that the supporters were not going to tolerate such a position for much longer, it\u2019s very very hard for any manager to survive in those sort of circumstances.",

          "text": "Federal regulators are expected to authorize the mixing and matching of COVID-19 booster doses this week in an effort to provide flexibility as the campaign for extra shots expands.\n\nThe upcoming announcement by the Food and Drug Administration is likely to come along with authorization for boosters of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots and follows the OK for a third dose for the Pfizer vaccine for many Americans last month. The move was previewed Tuesday by a U.S. health official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the announcement.\n\nThe FDA was expected to say that using the same brand for a booster was still preferable, especially for the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that have proved most effective against the coronavirus. The agency was still finalizing guidance for the single-shot J&J vaccine.\n\nPreliminary results from a government study of different booster combinations found an extra dose of any type revs up levels of virus-fighting antibodies regardless of the brand people first received. But recipients of the single-dose J&J vaccination had the most dramatic response \u2014 a 76-fold and 35-fold jump in antibody levels, respectively, shortly after either a Moderna or Pfizer booster, compared to a four-fold rise after a second J&J shot.\n\nOne confusing decision is what Moderna dose to recommend in combination with other brands. Moderna has applied for its booster to be half the original dose, saying that\u2019s plenty for people who already received two full-strength shots. But the mix-and-match study used full-strength extra doses, and there\u2019s no way to know if a half-dose Moderna booster would trigger as strong a reaction in J&J recipients.\n\nAllowing mixing and matching could make the task of getting a booster simpler for Americans and allow people who may have had adverse reactions to the initial dose to try a different shot.\n\nLast week, the U.S. said it would recognize combinations of vaccines administered overseas for the purposes of entering the country. The practice was common in Canada and some European countries in the early months of the vaccination campaign..",
