          "title": "It\u2019s politically suicidal for APC to retain Buni as chairman \u2013Ajulo",
          "text": "In this interview with OLADIMEJI RAMON, a lawyer, Dr Kayode Ajulo, argues that it is dangerous for the ruling All Progressives Congress to continue to have Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, as the Chairman of its Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee\n\nWill you say it was foolhardy for the All Progressives Congress to have gone ahead with its ward congresses last Saturday given the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Mr Eyitayo Jegede challenging the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State?\n\nIt is no longer news that in a 4-3 decision, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by Eyitayo Jegede (SAN) of the Peoples Democratic Party, challenging the election of Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN). To put it in another way, the apex court upheld the earlier decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Ondo State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal. Now to your question, the decision of the Supreme Court gives a hint and the take-home is that those who have ears should hear what the court is saying. The dissenting judgment may not have a force of law or compulsion but it\u2019s instructive, it\u2019s like a conscience which is an open wound as it aroused some sentiments that cannot be wished away that the APC leadership under a sitting governor is encumbered.\n\nHowever, relating it with the ward congresses held across the nation by the APC, I am not good at speculating but the situation is onerous. Who knows what might have informed the party\u2019s decision to go ahead with its ward congresses; may be (it was) to showcase the collective strength and resilience of the party.\n\nWith the deed done, is there any means, no matter how tiny, by which the APC can escape the nullification of the candidates thrown up from the congresses?\n\nAgain, I recognise the hint, no matter how infinitesimal it may look to some optimistic leaders of the party. That dissenting judgment of the apex court has exposed the weakness of the anomalous impact of the continued stay in office of Governor Mai Mala Buni, the chairman of the APC National Caretaker and Convention Planning Committee.\n\nHowever, party congresses, just like voters\u2019 registration, are a continuum and what has been done can either be undone if and when a new leadership emerges and as such the issue of possible nullification of candidates can be totally avoided; but as things stand, we are looking at a politically-suicidal situation and my counsel is that the APC, through its National Executive Council of the party, should guide the party in the process of electing new national executives.\n\nThe opposition Peoples Democratic Party also issued a statement, berating the APC for going ahead with the ward congresses in spite of the Supreme Court decision. Don\u2019t you think the PDP should have just kept quiet and work towards taking advantage of the situation in coming elections?\n\nThe statement issued by the PDP is tantamount to crying more than the bereaved; I have never been sympathetic to an unjust cause particularly in political space. My advice to its leadership is that it should remove the log in its eyes before crying wolf over the speck in the eyes of another. Whatever the PDP is saying reeks of deep-seated mala fide and it is rivalry taken too far and they should refrain from such bitter opposition. In fact, as we speak, several gross allegations have been levelled against the party\u2019s National Chairman, Prince Secondus.\n\nAlso, the recent resignation of seven deputy national officers of the party with poor leadership being cited as reason is indicative that the party structure is anything but well.\n\nWhat will you recommend as the way forward for the APC?\n\nWhat I have always recommended at different fora is that the APC should put its house in order. The prolonged stay of Mai Mala Buni in office smacks of unrestrained impunity and this must be addressed without any delay. The provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended is abundantly clear that a governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever. The Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, as the Chairman of the APC National Caretaker and Convention Planning Committee sees to the day-to-day running of the party and he cannot, in all honesty, claim he is not the Chief Executive Officer of the party. This constitutional infraction is a costly mistake that needs to be remedied immediately before the fireworks of needles legal battles are ignited on the party. Also, Article 17(4) of the Constitution of the APC provides that no officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive office in government. These two provisions do not admit of any discretion and strict adherence to it has been commanded by the operative word \u2018shall\u2019. In the light of this, the APC should retrace its steps and uphold the standards and ethos worthy of a party acclaimed to be the largest party in Africa\u2019s largest democracy. As a first step, there is a need for Mai Mala Buni to bow out graciously so that every other apparatus of the party can be activated to properly elect a substantive Chairman, because as the old proverbial saying goes \u2018a stitch in time saves nine\u2019.\n\nWill you say the recent gale of defections into the APC from other parties has laid to rest the assertion by some that the APC would disintegrate when President Buhari\u2019s tenure ends?\n\nLet me take a critical stance here and my considered opinion is that the ideological propensities of our present crop of politicians, save for a few, have little or nothing to do with ideologies, principles, patriotism or in a narrower sense, party interest. The average Nigerian politician is nomadic in nature, so what may appear as gain to the APC in terms of the defection may as well become problematic by the time some of these diehard politicians reveal their true parochial and self-interests as opposed to the ultimate interest of the Nigeria people.\n\nFurthermore, with this current issue of the implied disapproval of Buni\u2019s chairmanship, it will not surprise you to know that some politicians in the APC are already mooting the idea of seeking their salvation elsewhere. Therefore, while no one can be barred from pursuing his ambitions within the legally permissible structures of the party or elsewhere, it is better to take the defections with a pinch of salt while we watch as events unfold. It is also a wrong assertion that the party will disintegrate at the end of President Buhari\u2019s tenure in the first place.\n\nINEC has expressed concerns and sought the help of the NBA and the NJC over what it described as conflicting court decisions on parties\u2019 candidates for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State. Do you think the NBA or the NJC will be able to help in such circumstances?\n\nI view this as a satisfactory move as these two important bodies have disciplinary jurisdictions over members of the Bar and the bench and I think that given this move, most lawyers and judges alike will be wary of being subjected to the whimsical machinations of politicians. However, INEC should also respect court decisions and seek accelerated hearings of these cases up to the Supreme Court as there will always be just one unappealable decision of the Supreme Court and the jurisprudential value of such decisions, in my opinion, will deepen party politics and by extension of national politics.\n\nPoor voters\u2019 turnout was recorded during the recently conducted LGA elections in Lagos and Ogun states. Does this underscore the perceived diminishing relevance of the LGAs in the scheme of governance in the country?\n\nThe place of the local government cannot be wished away because it is a constitutionally-backed tier of government, so what can be done is to ensure its autonomous development within the political space. The question we should ask is that given the publicity that greets general elections in this country, why was same not accorded to the LG elections of the nation\u2019s commercial capital, Lagos State and Ogun State. Henceforth, members of civil society groups, election monitoring groups and of course interest groups should be adequately mobilised for wider publicity of local government elections in this country. From the facts available to me, the low voters\u2019 turnout can be mainly attributed to poor publicity as most residents were totally unaware of the elections. Local governments are the closest to the grassroots and to that extent, their affairs including elections must matter to all and sundry. With the right political will and attitude from States\u2019 Chief Executives, the system of local government administration will improve and it will be evident before our very eyes.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Imo varsity ex-head of department alleged of certificate forgery",
          "text": "A senior lecturer and immediate past Head of Department, Electrical Electronics Engineering, Imo State University, Owerri, Dr Michael Anumaka, is in the midst of the storm over alleged certificate forgery.\n\nThe lecturer, who was employed in the university in 2012, allegedly claimed to have obtained his first degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering from Clayton University, Missouri, the United States of America in 2003.\n\nThe authenticity of his degree could not be verified.\n\nHis curriculum vitae obtained by our reporter also indicated that he obtained Advanced Diploma and Postgraduate Diploma, both in Electrical Electronics Engineering, from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri.\n\nAgain, the FUTO management denied issuing him the two certificates. The certificate were issued by FUTO Consult, a body whose courses have not been approved by the university.\n\nSunday PUNCH gathered that the certificate fraud was let open when the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria visited his department for accreditation.\n\nThe panel was said to have first discovered that he registered with them without having credit in Mathematics in his O-level.\n\nSunday PUNCH gathered that COREN wrote Anumaka\u2019s acting head of department, GI Uchegbulem, on their discoveries.\n\nUchegbulem, in a letter addressed to the Vice-Chancellor, through the Registrar, dated June 14, 2012, asked the management to look into the findings of the professional body.\n\nThe letter titled, \u2018Re: Verification of MC Anumaka\u2019s Advanced Diploma and PGD certificates issued by FUTO Consult,\u2019 said the discovery made the body enquired about his other certificates.\n\nIt read, \u201cIt was during the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria accreditation that the panel saw MC Anumaka\u2019s file and noticed that at no time did he have credit in Mathematics. They were worried and queried how he was registered as an engineer by COREN.\n\n\u201cIn their interaction with Prof SOE Ogbogu and other lecturers from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, they wanted to know about the Advanced Diploma and the PGD certificate which Anumaka obtained from FUTO.\n\n\u201cIt was Prof Ogbogu who informed the team in a heated argument with Anumaka that the management of FUTO had no knowledge of such qualifications. He spoke as the Head of Electrical Engineering Department, FUTO, and a member of the Senate as of the dates the \u2018qualifications\u2019 were obtained.\n\n\u201cIt was alleged that the programmes in question were neither accredited by NUC nor NBTE, but run by one \u2018Dr Oliver Osuagwu\u2019 as a private business under the cover of FUTO Consult. The said Oliver Osuagwu was at no time the Registrar of FUTO and should not have signed as the Registrar of FUTO in the certificates; except there is another FUTO. It is up to you sir to make your deductions and judge.\u201d\n\nOn the strength of the discoveries, the Imo State University reportedly suspended the senior lecturer on November 4, 2014, for alleged forgery of the FUTO certificates.\n\nThe suspension letter, with ref: IMSU/REG/ACA/PF.0962, titled, \u2018Suspension from duty,\u2019 was signed by the varsity acting Registrar, ANcIgbojekwe.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cIn the course of verifying certificates you submitted to the university, on which basis you were offered employment, it was discovered that the FUTO/CCE Advanced Diploma and PGD certificates were not approved by the Senate of Federal University of Technology, Owerri.\n\n\u201cThis is attested by a letter from the Registrar of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, referenced, FUT/REG/CR/GEN/118/VOL 35, dated August 20, 2014. The implication of this is that it is not an academic programme of the university (FUTO).\n\n\u201cConsequently, the management directed that you be suspended from office, to enable us to carry out further investigation. You are directed to proceed on indefinite suspension pending further action. Please hand over all university property in your possession to your head of department,\u201d the letter read.\n\nSunday PUNCH however gathered that the embattled lecturer was reinstated after the former vice-chancellor completed his tenure.\n\nThe university, in another letter, with ref: IMUS/REG/ACA/PF.0962, dated October 14, 2015, rescinded the suspension without addressing the reasons for which the embattled lecturer was suspended.\n\nWhen our correspondent contacted Igbojekwe to ask the rationale behind the decision to reinstate the lecturer, he said he was no longer the registrar and could not answer the question.\n\nThe Public Relations Officers of the Imo State University, Dr Ralph Njoku-Obi, said he was aware of the suspension, but not informed about his recall.\n\n\u201cI know that he was suspended during the tenure of Prof UA Awuzie, who was the vice-chancellor. I know he was suspended for a thorough investigation of his certificates. That suspension was duly communicated to my office, but recalling him wasn\u2019t made known to me,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, when contacted on the telephone on the allegations of certificate forgery, Anumaka said he was waiting for his professorship, which according to him, is due by this year.\n\nHe described the allegations as baseless and unfounded, adding that those who were spreading \u201cfalsehood\u201d were envious of him and did not want him to be a professor.\n\nHe said, \u201cAll the allegations are a fallacy. As it stands now, I\u2019ve been appraised as a reader since 2019 by the department and faculty, and by that, I was supposed to be an associate professor in 2019. And I have been the HoD of electrical electronics engineering.\n\n\u201cI am the most senior lecturer in my department; others are junior ones\u2026If you\u2019re not qualified, the council cannot employ you and continue to promote you to be an associate professor. This year, I am supposed to be a professor. All those saying this or that are people who are jealous, who cannot work hard. I\u2019m a grounded scholar.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of obtaining O\u2019level after his PhD, the embattled lecturer said, \u201cThere was a time the National University Commission sent a circular anyone who wanted to remain a lecturer must obtain the Postgraduate Diploma in education.\n\n\u201cThose who were vibrant including me rallied around and then I had to get my O\u2019level that would enable me to obtain the education certificate in 2014. I passed and I have obtained my PGD in education. Right now, I am a certified teacher Class A.\u201d\n\nOn his earlier suspension by the university over the FUTO Consult Certificate, he said, \u201cThe suspension was in 2014 and we are in 2021. If all these allegations are true, I would have not gotten the senior lecturer position in 2015. I would not have been appraised as an associate professor in 2019, and now I am standing for a professorship. So these things are all fallacy.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A 35-year-old farmer, Muhammed Aliu, paraded for alleged impersonation by the Osun State Police Command on Saturday, tells BOLA BAMIGBOLA the story behind the \u2018lawyer\u2019s ID card\u2019 found on him\n\nWhat is your name and what is your job?\n\nMy name is Muhammed Aliu. I am 35 years old; I live at Owode-Ede (Osun State).\n\nWhat did you do that led to your arrest by the police?\n\nI was on a trip last week Tuesday to visit my Oluwo (my spiritualist) and consult the oracle. While still in transit, my friend, who is an accountant with Winners\u2019 Chapel called me and said some suspected thieves burgled the Winners\u2019 Chapel in Ede. Immediately he said that, I reminded him that I once advised that the church should fix a CCTV camera on the premises. I said had they done that, it would have enabled them to know the burglars, because it been a recurring thing.\n\nMy friend then told me he was going to the police station. As of the time he called me, I was already in Akure, Ondo State (capital).\n\nHow did this lead to the search on your house by the police?\n\nSome people in the church told the police that the accountant has a friend that usually comes around to visit him. They said police should search my house.\n\nI returned to Osun on Wednesday and I voluntarily went to the police station. When I got there, the police asked of my job and I said I am farmer. The police operatives said that my friend had told them that I am a lawyer but I told them that I am not a lawyer. I was told to sit at a place in the station and while sitting at the place, I wanted to pick handkerchief from my pocket to wipe my face. A policemen that saw me putting hands into pocket, asked what was in my pocket and I told him my ID card was there. The policeman came around and picked the ID card.\n\nWhat ID card did you have on at the time?\n\nIt is an ID card that portrayed me as a lawyer.\n\nSince you said you are not a lawyer, how did you come about an ID portraying you as a lawyer?\n\nI am not a lawyer. The ID card was given to me by one Odeleye, he is a lawyer based in Ibadan. He gave it to me when we were both radio presenters in Ibadan. We were working as advocates for Justice Corruption and he did the ID card for me; I paid for it.\n\nDid your work as an advocate for Justice Corruption entail playing the role of a lawyer or why was it important for you to carry an ID card portraying you as a lawyer?\n\nOdeleye said he had a lawyer that he would attach me to where I could work before I would return to school. I have never gone to court to defend any case. I have never gone to any station to bail any suspect.\n\nHow do you react to the allegation that you falsely claimed to be a lawyer?\n\nWhat happened was that recently, I caught some thieves and I took them to Ataoja Police Station, Osogbo. When I got there I didn\u2019t introduce myself as a lawyer. I was afraid that those I arrested might be released without trial. So, at that point, I told them I was a lawyer.\n\nWho did you tell that?\n\nI told policemen at Ataoja Police Station and others there. I just said it to ensure that those arrested were not released because, if they release them, the suspects might attack me.\n\nAre you married?\n\nI have one wife with two kids. I was given an admission to study Law at the University of Ilorin in 2012, but I couldn\u2019t pay school fees because I had no one to sponsor my education. The little money I had then, I used it to buy a motorcycle and I was using it for commercial transportation. Odeleye collected N100,000 from me when he gave me the ID card.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

So I am joining the PDP with my over 80,000 supporters and much more will be joining us in the coming days and weeks.\u201d\n\nShe stated that she was defecting with her supporters to PDP in order to join forces with the well meaning members of the party to build the country that had been brought to its knees by the APC led government.\n\nReceiving Mr. Adzape-Orubibi and her supporters, Governor Ortom said that due to the abysmal performance of the APC the PDP was waiting to welcome more defectors to her fold.\n\nThe governor reiterated that the PDP would take over the mantle of leadership from the APC in 2023 due to her poor performance in all sectors.\n\n\u201cThe Benue people have no reason to pitch tent with the APC because the party has failed to deliver democracy dividends to them. The hope of Benue people lies only in our party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cOur party has the capacity to take the State and country from the bottom to the top.

The outcries came after a committee of the House of Representatives, while investigating our foreign loans, claimed that Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty is being undermined as part of the terms for China\u2019s infrastructural loans to Nigeria.\n\nMinister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, who attended a recent House of Representatives public hearing, tried vigorously to explain the sovereignty waiver clause in the loan agreement and clear the misconception of Nigeria handing over its sovereignty to China.\n\nWe understand the quantum of emotion involving this issue. Unfortunately, we have allowed emotion to becloud the truth and reason. Nations all over the world borrow from each other. Countries borrow irrespective of how wealthy they are perceived to be. The United States of America, for instance, is rated as the richest country in the world.\n\nBut it has a national debt of $24.95 trillion as of May 1, 2020, the highest external debt stock in the world. There\u2019s hardly any nation without external indebtedness.\n\nThe hullabaloo about the terms of the Chinese loans is indeed unwarranted. Waiving of sovereignty or providing sovereign guarantees for loans is a standard clause in this type of foreign borrowing. It does not mean Nigerian sovereignty has been mortgaged.\n\nNigerians must understand the difference between international diplomatic immunity, which has to do with a nation\u2019s sovereignty and independent existence, and commercial immunity, which has to do with a nation\u2019s commitment to ensure the repayment of foreign loans it takes.\n\nThe \u201csovereign immunity\u201d Nigeria waived does not tamper with our country\u2019s sovereignty and independence. It is a mere routine commercial immunity waiver. Concessions relating to immunity for the purpose of provision of commercial guarantees are normal traditional rituals in loan agreements between sovereign countries.\n\nIt is on account of that, for example, that you see Nigeria signing an agreement with other institutions or nations and agreeing to a choice of territorial jurisdiction for the purpose of determining disputes if they arise.\n\nThat is how you see Nigeria submitting to jurisdiction for the determination of trade disputes in UK, Paris or other international destinations.\n\nA sovereignty waiver relating to loans between nations is nothing but a guarantee or commitment to repay the loan. It is restricted to specific assets and has nothing to do with loss of independence to another nation.\n\nNobody can recolonise Nigeria because of loan. No political leader has the power or capacity to cede Nigeria\u2019s political sovereignty to another nation. That is impossible.\n\nVANGUARD",

IPOB is a proscribed group, what do you want me to say about them. We are working.\n\n\u201cI do not believe in coming to the media to do my work, but if you are in Anambra, you would have seen what we are doing.

They are not the ones who arrested Nnamdi Kanu, nor is he in their custody.

They include painters, bricklayers, electricians, bus conductors, commercial drivers, palm wine tappers and market women who deal in akara, fried yam, potato and plantain, to say nothing about millions of young men and women who are unemployed or underemployed. To ask this category of people, who are still smarting from the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns, to stay indoors for a whole day every week is inconsiderate.\n\n\u201cWe wish to advise any group which wants to take a decision that will have long-term consequences for the Igbo to consult extensively with Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, among other stakeholders in the Southeast.

          "title": "IBB under fire for saying June 12 was annulled to save Abiola",
          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor /Innocent Duru/Justina Asishna, Minna/Alao Abiodun\n\nProminent pro-democracy crusaders and rights activists yesterday chided former military president, Ibrahim Babangida following his latest claims that he annulled the June 12, 1993, presidential election because there would have been a coup in the country.\n\nThe election was won by Chief Moshood Abiola, the candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) who later died in detention after he declared himself president.\n\nBabangida who spoke on Arise Television said there would have been a violent change of government if the election had \u2018materialised.\n\nHe ruled Nigeria between August 27, 1985, and August 1993.\n\nHe will be 80 years old later this month.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf it materialised, there would\u2019ve been a coup d\u2019etat \u2014 which could have been violent. That\u2019s all I can confirm.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen thanks to the engineering and the \u2018maradonic\u2019 way we handled you guys in the society. But that could\u2019ve given room for more instability in the country.\n\nHe alleged massive pressure from within and outside the military to cause trouble on account of the outcome of the election.\n\n\u201cThe military can do it because they have the weapons to do it, and others (civil society groups) can use agitation,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the Babangida claims, Afenifere and NADECO chieftains said the former military ruler was turning history on its head.\n\nAfenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Babangida never wanted to vacate office in the first place and had a predetermined agenda.\n\nHe lamented that that posturing was typical of ambitious military rulers from the North who loathed democratic transition and succession.\n\nAdebanjo said the annulment contributed to disunity and suspicion that an ethnic group was bent on dominating other groups.\n\nRead Also: IBB and the ghost of June 12\n\nHe maintained that the military drivers of the transition programme have gone into history as enemies of the people.\n\nAdebanjo said: \u201cBabangida never wanted to go. He was changing the goal post during the game.\n\n\u201cThey only want unity according to their terms. They want to dictate the conditions for unity. We should sit down and agree. Otherwise, the deceit will continue.\u201d\n\nAn Afenifere chieftain, Senator Olabiyi Durojaye, lamented that the historic poll results were cancelled after Nigeria held a free and fair exercise.\n\nHe said the annulment was annoying because Nigerians were full of expectations about a new dawn in the post-military era.\n\nDurojaye, who was detained by the military over the pro-democracy struggle, said if Babangida had any information about an imminent coup, there was no evidence that he shared it with his colleagues in the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) and other critical stakeholders.\n\nNoting that many have not overcome the shock of the annulment, he said:\u201dHistory will take care of all the actors.\u201d\n\nNADECO chieftain and Third Republic House of Representatives Chief Whip, Olawale Oshun, accused Babangida of engaging in what he described as deliberate falsehood.\n\nHe said no one would buy unfounded rationalization and deceit\n\nOshun, who is the leader of Afenifere Renewal Group(ARG), said Babangida has God to contend with because his action led to the death of many young people along Ikorodu Road, Lagos when Abacha\u2019s men opened fire during protest.\n\nHe said IBB\u2019s account contradicted those of his colleagues in the AFRC, who were also taken aback by the annulment of the popular will.\n\nOshun said Babangida never wanted to vacate office, adding that in that plot to perpetuate the military, Gen. Sani Abacha was smarter.\n\nHe also lamented that the former military President polarized the polity in a bid to remain in power.\n\nOshun said:\u201dHe did not want to go. I was in the House of Representatives at that time. I knew the efforts he made to compromise the House to remain in office. The House was polarized.\n\n\u201cOf course, there were some ambitious men around him: people like Mark, who were not pleased with an Abiola presidency. But, officers like Col. Umar stood their ground on the election.\u201d\n\nWhile arguing that IBB lied during the television interview, he added:\u201dHe should tell that to the marines. Nigerians voted. He should have allowed it to stand.\n\n\u201c Abiola won in the barracks. He said soldiers wanted to stage a coup. Are the soldiers more than millions of Nigerians who voted? IBB ruined our country. \u201c\n\nWhy we took decision to annul MKO\u2019s victory\n\nBabangida, in the interview in which he also spoke on various national issues,branded his justification for the annulment of the June 12,1993 presidential election as his \u201chonest reason\u201d for the action.\n\nHis words: \u201cIf it materialised, there would\u2019ve been a coup d\u2019etat \u2014 which could have been violent. That\u2019s all I can confirm.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen thanks to the engineering and the \u2018maradonic\u2019 way we handled you guys in the society. But that could\u2019ve given room for more instability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe military can do it because they have the weapons to do it, and others (civil society groups) can use agitation.\u201d\n\nHe laid claims to \u201cdeft political moves\u201d during his reign.\n\nSuch moves,he said,earned him the nickname \u2018Maradona\u2019 after the later Argentine footballer,Diego Maradona,who was renowned for his dribbling skills.\n\nHe said:\u201cThe definition of Maradona I got from the media is because of deft political moves. That\u2019s the way the media described it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the very good thing about the Nigerian media and Nigerian people, you have to anticipate them. If you anticipate them, then you live well with them. They call me \u2018evil genius\u2019, I marvel at that. The contradiction \u2014 you can\u2019t be evil and then a genius.\u201d\n\nBabangida said his administration fought corruption better than the Buhari government is currently doing.\n\nHe cited the case of a military governor he claimed to have fired for alleged corruption involving about N300, 000 at that time.\n\nHe contrasted that with what he said now obtains when governors who stole billions of naira are walking free.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s military rulers are saints compared to civilians in terms of their handling of the nation\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cYou cannot compare what we did with what is on the ground now in terms of corruption. Corruption is more now. We are saints when compared to what is happening in the democratic era,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in leadership, I sacked a governor for misappropriating less than N313,000 but today, billions are being stolen and misappropriated, a lot of them are in court but still parade themselves in the streets. So tell me, who else is better at fighting corruption?\u201d\n\nMy type of Nigeria\u2019s next ruler\n\nBabangida,an avowed supporter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said he has identified three persons who meet his criteria for Nigeria\u2019s next President.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. He should be a person who travels this country and has friends in every state of the country; a person who is very vast in the economy, a person who is a good politician who is ready to talk to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have seen about three already. The person should be in his 60s and I believe if we get such person, Nigeria will get it right.\u201d\n\nHe said zoning is not particularly good for the country.\n\n\u201cWe will have to make a choice either we want to practice democracy the way it should be practised or according to our whims and caprices,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe way it should be done is to allow the process to be followed and allow anyone interested to throw his cap in regardless of where he comes from. Whether now or in the future, we will have to jettison the zoning system or power shift.\u201d\n\nBabangida who overthrew President Muhammadu Buhari in 1985 described their relationship as \u201cstill very good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am happy that we relate well.\u201d\n\nHe accused the media of causing \u201cthe seeming rift between us.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s unity non-negotiable\n\nHe expressed opposition to current agitation to balkanize the country by separatists.\n\nHe called for talks on how to strengthen the unity of the country.\n\nHe blamed the current agitations on \u201cthe tyranny of the elites.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe politicians and elites are to be blamed.\n\n\u201cIt is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one. When they make the noise, they find that it won\u2019t get supported, because Nigerians generally don\u2019t believe in anything that would disturb their peace of mind. They won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201dIf you look back, if you take a place like Baga, in the north-east, the Igbo man, Yoruba man travelled up to Baga for trading, he lived very comfortably, he lived very well with the people around there.\n\n\u201cIf you go to Lagos, the same thing, Yorubas, Igbos, who hold political appointments at local levels live very well with the people.\n\n\u201cI think we, the coming elites, did not succeed in imbibing that culture (culture of unity) for the country, so we rather live with the culture that the Europeans handed over to us \u2014 Northern Nigeria, Eastern Nigeria, Western Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is a disconnect between leadership and followership. We don\u2019t have core values anymore in the country which can be defended at any time. The way out is that leaders should understand Nigeria and Nigerians; use their intellect for the benefit of the people.\n\n\u201cThere is too much control in the way the economy is now, there is a need to open it further, tap into the God-given talent of the people of the country.\u201d",

          "title": "Who is afraid of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu?",
          "text": "By Tunde Rahman\n\nWhy do many political opponents dread the All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, so much so that in their wishful thinking they hope he gives way or simply quit the stage? Why should political contestation get to the point where our so-called political leaders would be wishing their competitors dead if they are actually in politics for the public good? These are some of the questions that have agitated my mind following the repeated unfounded rumours about Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s health status. In the last few months, the former Lagos governor has died many times over in the reckoning of these nefarious persons.\n\nEach time Asiwaju travels, the next thing these detractors, who abound in PDP as in APC, do is to shamelessly claim he is seriously ill undergoing surgery or that he has died. Yet, each time they have made such blatant claims, the lie has always blown up on their very faces, as they have always been proven wrong.\n\nSurprisingly, some of these evil persons would also claim the APC national leader is no longer relevant in the scheme of things in the party he helped form. And you wonder: if he is no longer important within the APC, why dissipating energies about him? Why hoping he dies each time he steps out of the country?\n\nThese people have been in this despicable game for quite a while. They have perpetrated so much hatred and told too many lies such that to track them can be a herculean task. Let me attempt a recall of a few of these. In April this year, when we went for Umrah (lesser Hajj) in Saudi Arabia, they brought out a photo-shopped photograph that portrayed Asiwaju in very bad light. The picture was so bad that you would wonder whether it had any feature of him. All that these malicious people wanted to demonstrate is Asiwaju is so badly ill or incapacitated that he cannot even aspire to lead this country, talk less mount the exalted office. Ironically, at the same lesser Hajj, Asiwaju, who the malevolent imagined dead, effortlessly performed tawaf (going round the holy Kabbah) several times and underwent all the rites of Umrah. I was in that entourage to Umrah along with some of his friends and associates including Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, former EFCC Chairman Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, and former National Welfare Officer of APC, Alhaji Ibrahim Masari, among others.\n\nElucidating on how we arrived in Medina around 4 am, how tired, weary and needing sleep we all proceeded to Mecca, a distance of 4-and-a-half hours, that same morning we landed in the kingdom, and how on eventual arrival in Mecca we immediately headed for the Kabbah, would help put a lie to the claim about Asiwaju\u2019s ill-health.\n\nThe journey from Medina to Mecca by road was very strenuous. Virtually all of us slept. Not Asiwaju. He was awake throughout, conversing with the driver, Mustapha, and ensuring he was awake and alert for the duration of the drive. We arrived in Mecca without any hassle, quickly checked into a hotel, and then headed for the Kabbah for tawaf and other rites of Umrah. Leading the charge, Asiwaju Tinubu painlessly performed the seven-round tawaf and shortly after, being a Friday, it was time for Jummah. We left Medina immediately we arrived because way back in that holy city, Asiwaju had insisted he would like to observe Jummah in Mecca.\n\nFor the duration of the trip, Asiwaju\u2019s hotel suite in Mecca was turned into a Mecca of sort with governors, ministers, other top dignitaries and Islamic clerics coming to visit him. Overlooking the Kabbah, it was in his living room that we were observing some of the prayers and making supplications to Allah.\n\nMany took selfies with him with their cameras and phones unencumbered. He allowed as many as wanted to take photographs with him to do so, an opportunity some abused. An example was someone who either unknowingly deployed a phone with a bad camera or deliberately doctored the photograph, which was now used to achieve nefarious ends, as depicted by that damaging picture of Asiwaju in Saudi.\n\nAgain, not long after we returned from Umrah and the former Lagos governor undertook a trip abroad, I think to France and UK, there were also unfounded reports that he had been hospitalised in Paris for alleged coronavirus attack and had even purportedly undergone an operation. Some proceeded from there to claim he had died. Now, Asiwaju has never tested positive for COVID-19. Not at that alleged time, not at present. For the life of me, how could someone who had never been positive for coronavirus be hospitalised for it or undergone a surgery for complications arising from the virus he never contracted? I volunteered this much not to disparage many who had contracted the virus or those presently battling the dreaded menace.\n\nEach time we felt we had over-exposed ourselves or someone had contracted the virus in the team, we would call for coronavirus tests and no one is exempted. Asiwaju and some of us must have undergone close to 15 COVID-19 tests each. Some of us, including this writer, had even tested positive for the virus at one point or another. Asiwaju has never experienced it once.\n\nThe fake news about Asiwaju\u2019s alleged ill health or death is something we have become accustomed to each time he travels out of the country such that it has become a joke of sorts. Indeed, we had a hilarious encounter when he embarked on the extant travel some two weeks ago. As I made to leave him at the Lagos airport, I said: \u201cSir, now that you are traveling again, when these mischievous guys begin to say you are either dying or dead, what do I say to them?\u201d We had a good laugh. He then said: \u201cJust say I have travelled and don\u2019t mind whatever they say.\u201d\n\nSo the speculation trailing the extant trip is what it is: fake, unfounded news. It bears repeating, however, to state that Asiwaju is hale and hearty. He is not in any hospital. He does not have any medical situation that would require hospitalisation either in Nigeria or abroad.\n\nIt is sad that perpetrators of this mischief are not deterred by the fact that each time this fake news has been propagated they have been proven wrong.\n\nHowever, there are a few points to make at this juncture. Firstly, some speak magisterially on the state of health of Asiwaju Tinubu. They say he doesn\u2019t enjoy good health. Are they his doctors? Are they saying they are privy to his medical records? Pray, how could an unhealthy man muster the strength and energy to go through the rigors of tawaf and all rites associated with Umrah immediately after a six-hour flight and over four-hour road trip?\n\nThose perpetrating this evil think they are unknown. They hide their identities behind the anonymity of the social media. But we have a fair idea who they are. Their luck will run out soon as they would be exposed sooner than later!\n\nAgain, these people who try to rubbish Asiwaju\u2019s health, peddling rumours that he is dead forget that the matter of life and death is within the realm of God. Not of any individual. They should not attempt to play God. They conveniently forgot what many dubbed the Zik\u2019s curse. Recall that Nigeria\u2019s first president and one of our foremost leaders, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, was rumoured dead I think around November 1989. Some prominent print media organisations and television stations published the story without conducting due diligence and checks. With banner headlines cast in impressive adjectives befitting the Great Zik, they proudly proclaimed the nationalist dead. Some of Zik\u2019s associates, some of whom had not seen him in years, particularly the late Chief RBK Okafor, also fell for it, ranting about their close relationship with the late nationalist and how they were with him in his last moments.\n\nReminiscing on this episode in an article titled \u201cThe Day Zik Didn\u2019t Die\u201d published by THE NATION newspaper on November 8, 2016, celebrated columnist, Professor Olatunji Dare, had this to say: \u201cOut-of-work politicians\n\nsaw an opening and moved in swiftly. A First Republic legislator and former stalwart of the Zikist Movement, Chief RBK Okafor, panting as if he had sprinted all the way from Nsukka to Rutam House in Lagos, narrated breathlessly how he had cradled his \u201cbeloved Zik\u201d in his arms and how, even as his life ebbed, the great nationalist had said to him: \u201cChief RBK Okafor, my political son, remember that I am a Pan-Africanist and should be given a Pan-African burial.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Zik\u2019s rumoured death was false. It was fake news. Zik did not die. At least he did not die at that time. He read that obituary in the newspapers. He also reportedly cursed those people grandstanding over his purported death. And one by one, they died before him. Zik went on to live for another seven years. The long and short of all of this is those wishing Asiwaju dead, hoping to profit from it should be very careful. They should be wary of the wrath of God.\n\nHaving stated all of that, my final point is media stakeholders must meet minds together and devise a way to halt the excesses of the social media. We must help to stem this menace of fake news, hate speech and abusive language. There must be a form of regulation for this nonsense going on, on social media. I\u2019m totally in support of peer regulation, regulation within the media industry itself, but we must scale up enforcement of this regulation. Why don\u2019t we draft the regulations ourselves and approach the National Assembly for legislation to back them up to make these regulations institutional as some professionals have also suggested?\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "title": "Seven profitable businesses you can start with N100,000 or less",
          "text": "By Ayo Alonge\n\nAmidst the so-called \u201charsh economy\u201d which has necessitated a poor living condition for most Nigerians, suffice to say that there are still small businesses which can yield an appreciable return on investment (ROI) when viewed against the backdrop of lucrative startups in the country.\n\nHowever, in the day-to-day running of business, players in small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) are often bedeviled by a litany of challenges, ranging from financing to the diminishing purchasing power from the part of prospective buyers, necessitating some entrepreneurs to shift the blame on government at all levels, since they play a major role in the decision of how businesses are run, through certain regulatory processes, with respect to the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nMiffed by the economic upheaval which has taken its toll on SMEs, Tochukwu Ubochioma, who owns a printing press startup in Lagos, explained to our correspondent that the challenges faced by startups in the country range from lack of enabling environment and infrastructure to inaccessibility to funds and poor power supply.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the world\u2019s leading business locations on the African continent. But when it comes to doing business in Nigeria, there are several challenges that confront a typical Nigerian business. In 2016, out of 189 countries, Nigeria was ranked 169th in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Report.\n\n\u201cFinance and funding is a major aspect of starting or setting up a business. Money is needed to buy materials, suppliers, equipment, pay staff and lots more. In Nigeria, funding is a major problem, especially if an entrepreneur does not have enough money to kick start the business.\n\n\u201cGetting access to constant electricity and power supply is a major concern for business in Nigeria. As of June 2018, an average household in Nigeria can only have access to 6 hours uninterrupted power supply out of the 24 hours that exist in a given day. This is why the use of generators as an alternative power source is so common in Nigeria,\u201d he said. It, however, behoves any wise entrepreneur to invest in ventures that deal in basic humans needs or other essential services, since purchasing power is on a continuous decline, as occasioned by the lingering COVID-19 pandemic and global recession. All things being equal, if your personality speaks of one who is hardworking, focused, passionate and possessing other entrepreneurial skills, a startup of N100,000 or less can, invariably, metamorphose into a much bigger enterprise, in no distant time. Thus, if the golden question that keeps popping up for you is \u2014 what business can I run with N100,000 or less with good profit? \u2014 then, here are some of such ventures, in no particular order.\n\nOne: Food vending\n\nIt is nothing but an absolute truth to assert that, with the necessary managerial skills put in place, one is sure to make good money from this line of business, considering the fact that people eat every day, even if not three times daily.\n\nAside establishing a roadside food stand, suffice to say that with the advent of modern courier services, any investor can choose to connect with residents, workers and students, for food delivery. In most cities, residents often prefer to order food (soup bowls inclusive), in a bid to satisfy a special craving for a particular meal they are too busy to prepare on their own. Similarly, anyone can choose to deal in raw food items. That is lucrative too. For instance, a 50kg bag of rice, when sold in cups, can yield at least 60 per cent return on investment.\n\nTwo: Poultry farming\n\nPoultry farming is one business which makes investors smile to the bank, any day. Despite its attendant challenges, a popular specialist in poultry farming, Rilwan Raji, while speaking with Saturday Sun, said: \u201cFarming business is very profitable. For instance, poultry farming is a business that does not need too much introduction.\n\nThe funniest thing is that it can still be referred to as untapped because the few ones we have in the country are badly managed. It is a highly profitable business. The rate of poultry egg consumption is very high in Nigeria, being one of the cheapest sources of protein. Any farmer who goes into egg business will never regret it. It is another goldmine. Poultry birds processing is another super business in poultry which is still not tapped yet. About 75 per cent of what is consumed is still being smuggled into the country. With the smuggling plus locally produced ones, it still has not met up to 30 per cent of what is required.\u201d\n\nThree: Laundry\n\nWithout a second thought, this is one business that any wise entrepreneur can go into and won\u2019t regret. In major cities, residents are always in dire need of getting their laundry done for them, due to their busy schedule. Hence, every business-minded person may want to explore this business opportunity.\n\nPerhaps one thing that makes the business very interesting is that it yields over 200 per cent return on investment. To get started, one can even make use of one\u2019s spacious residence, get a washing machine and other few equipment which won\u2019t even cost an arm and a leg. Eureka! You are in business already!\n\nFour: Skincare\n\nYet another business one is sure to have a very appreciable profit margin from is the skincare business. In today\u2019s Nigeria, many people, especially females, do not joke with taking care of their skins, using both organic and inorganic skincare products. Tosin Babalola, a seller of organic skincare products in Lagos, who runs her own startup named Finest Beauty Skincare noted: \u201cSkincare business has the tendency to grow wide across this nation, especially if you produce by yourself. With a small amount of money, you can start the business and then you grow it as time progresses. You can start with as low as N100,000 and still make over a 100 percent profit on each product sold. All you need is to produce in small quantity at a time. You also need a clean environment for your production. The necessary equipment needed to start your skincare business are everywhere in the market and quite affordable for any startup.\u201d\n\nFive: Organic drinks production\n\nIncreasingly, people are getting aware of the health implications of carbonated drinks because of the high risk of stroke, diabetes, and high blood pressure. This has caused a constant drift from soft drinks to naturally made drinks and fruit juices, without sugar and additives. So, anyone who goes into production and sales of naturally made drinks now is in it to make a lot of profit. Some examples of naturally made drinks are zobo, kunu, fruit juice, fura da nunu and tiger nut drink. With a N100,000 budget or less, all you need to transform this business idea into a profitable venture is a blender, desired fruits, ingredients, plastic bottles and a refrigerator. If you don\u2019t have a refrigerator yet, you may start with buying blocks of ice. You may then begin to supply your well branded product to malls and local markets.\n\nSix: Palm oil retailing\n\nPerhaps one of the most lucrative businesses that can be started with N100,000 or less is the palm oil retailing business. Yet most people are oblivious of this. Since the price of palm oil fluctuates seasonally, one could buy when it is cheaper in gallons of 20 litres and sell at retail prices during the period of scarcity which automatically results in a hike in price.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, a key player in the business, Olumide Adelugba, disclosed that within few months, any investor can cash out not less than 100 per cent return on investment.\n\n\u201cPalm oil business is a very lucrative business. Asides the fact that the business is lucrative, it is also one of the very viable businesses that one can start with as low as N100,000, even less.\n\n\u201cPalm oil business does not have any technicality. For a small scale starter, all you need do is buy a keg of Palm oil from any of the palm oil producing states in Nigeria during the palm oil boom season. Palm oil boom season is between March and June. At this time, 25 litres of palm oil sells for as low as N8,000. With N80,000, you can buy 10 kegs. \u201cThe real deal is that you buy the 10 kegs, store them appropriately for three to five months. By then, the price in the market would have risen by over 100 per cent. The demand for oil is very high. It is one of the most demanded household commodities.\n\nSeven: Phone charging venture\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the fact that unstable power supply has been a key challenge in the country, particularly in most rural communities where people can\u2019t afford acquiring a generator set for personal use, it has become exigent to venture into this line of business.\n\nAll you need to start is a power source, a wide wooden board with lots of electric ports to accommodate as many phones. Anyone can start this business with even less than N100,000.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "IBB on Corruption: With the Fact on Ground Now, My Govt a Saint",
          "text": "*Wants next President to be versed in economics, able to talk to the people\n\n*Says military overstrained in war against terrorists\n\nAhamefula Ogbu\n\nFormer military President, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida has described his regime as a saint, when compared to the level of corruption being witnessed today in the country under a democratic government, and further denied the notion that he popularised corruption in Nigeria.\n\nBabangida, who spoke in an exclusive interview on Arise News Channel yesterday from his Minna Hilltop Mansion, also wants the next Nigerian president to be an acceptable person who has contacts across the country, and given the peculiarities in our economy, should be well versed in economic matters, and be in his 60s in terms of age.\n\nAnswering directly on the allegation that he popularised corruption, Babangida, who was head of state between 1985 and 1993, said: \u201cWell, you can\u2019t compare it with the fact on the ground now. From what I read, from analysis, I think we are saints when compared to what is happening under a democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cI sacked a governor for misappropriating less than N313, 000; today billions are there in the streets. Those who have stolen billions are in courts, and are now parading themselves on the streets. So, who is better in fighting corruption?\u201d\n\nOn the kind of President Nigeria deserves in 2023, Babangida ruled out former vice president, Atiku Abubakar and a former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, because they would be in their 70s by the next election.\n\nAlthough IBB, as Babangida is fondly called, did not in any way mention their names as ineligible for the nation\u2019s number one seat, he however suggested that individuals in their 60s should be the focus of Nigerians as potential presidential candidates in 2023.\n\nBy the next general election in 2023, Atiku, who is 75 this year, would be 77, while Tinubu, who marked an official 68th birthday in March, would have turned 70 years.\n\nSpecifically on the importance of leadership in nation-building and where he thought the likes of Atiku and Tinubu no longer fit the bill, IBB said: \u201cIf you get a good leadership that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay.\n\n\u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country, has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very verse in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.\u201d\n\nBut when asked if the person could emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election, the Minna-born former military leader said, \u201cI believe so, if we can get him.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on whether or not he still believed in the future of Nigeria, IBB, who turns 80 on August 17, 2021, said: \u201cI do believe in the future of Nigeria, but Nigerians don\u2019t believe in the future of their country. They created and they destroyed.\u201d\n\nReiterating his belief in the future of Nigeria and urging Nigerians to remain patriotic, Babangida, who claimed to feeling good as he was about to turn 80 years, with gratitude to God for sparing his life, advised Nigerians to go for the person that has what it takes to transform the country when the time comes.\n\nHe also stated that the need to avoid a bloody coup, which would have set the country back several decades, informed the annulment of the 1993 Presidential election presumed to have been won by late Moshood Kashimowu Abiola.\n\nBabangida said: \u201cYou want me to be honest with you? If it materialised, there would have been a coup which would have been violent, that\u2019s all I can confirm. It didn\u2019t happen thanks to the engineering and Maradonic way we handled you guys in the society; but that could have given room for more instability in the country.\u201d\n\nProdded further on whether the sentiment was among the military or cut across civilian population, he said, \u201cBoth. The military, they can do it because they have the weapons to do it but the other society members will agitate.\u201d\n\nOn insecurity, he admitted that the military needed to be better equipped, trained and offered improved leadership, adding that \u201cthey are not overwhelmed but overstretched\u201d because of the expansive areas of coverage arising from spread in insecurity.\n\nBabangida regretted that the stultified system of things in the country was due to what he described as tyranny of the elites who had made no efforts to harness the positive qualities naturally embedded in the multi-ethnic composition of the country.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians are too intelligent, resourceful and hardworking not to be able to pull the country back from the brinks, but regretted that poor leadership had been the bane which had divested the nation of a rallying point.\n\nWhile proffering solution to the myriad problems of the country, he pulled his weight behind resource control but warned that some people who either misunderstood the working principles of the proposition would call for the head of whoever propounds such.\n\nApparently not backing zoning and power shift, he was insistent that unless the country wanted to introduce its own whims and caprices in the practice of democracy, there was need for politicians to allow the principles of democracy, as globally practiced, to choose its leadership, insisting that it would be done now or in the future.\n\nHe argued that with time, people with the finest qualities of leadership, that had popular appeal, would emerge no matter what part of the country such would come from which would be immaterial once things start working fine.\n\nTo him, the economy was being overregulated as he called for freeing it, while arguing that production and export would be the twin redeeming principles for the sliding Naira, pointing out that Nigerians had the capacity to achieve it.\n\nHe denied being anti-media, claiming that he libralised it, leading to the birth of many private media, both print and electronic. He further dismissed as silly, trying to muscle the press as it would be an exercise in futility.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fear the media, I libralised it, you don\u2019t forget. Today, you have private televisions, private newspapers and so on, so I have no fear of the media; I believe they are an essential part of the society and they should play the role for the society. So, I have no fear of the media whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nOn moves to muscle the media, he pointed out: \u201cThe media and the public will not allow that to happen and it is even silly to start trying clipping them. I said Nigerians are very wonderful people, you cannot intimidate them.\u201d\n\nAn ebullient Babangida described the relationship between him and President Buhari, whom he had a hand in his overthrow, as normal and cordial and accused the media of manufacturing a bad relationship between them, adding, \u201cOur relationship is still very good and I am happy we relate good but the seeming bad relationship was the creation of your people the media.\u201d\n\nAppearing unfazed about the agitation for secession he said, \u201cWell, my thoughts are: it is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one, when they make the noise, they will find out that it won\u2019t get support because Nigerians don\u2019t generally believe on anything that will disturb their peace of mind.\u201d\n\nOn restructuring, he said it had as many meaning as the number of people speaking on it, adding that there was no general consensus on what it was and how to go about it but opined that it could start with allowing the people at the grassroots to determine and have more participation in how their affairs were run.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says operations now reinvigorated, optimistic about positive results soon\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Nigerian Army yesterday said it had reinvigorated its operations and strengthened them to enable the troops take the war to the enclaves of insurgents, bandits and other criminals terrorising the country.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant-Gen Faruk Yahaya, disclosed this shortly after addressing troops at the Fort Muhammadu Buhari Forward Operating Base, Daura, Katsina State.\n\nHe reiterated that the Nigerian Army would carry out its operational battles to the enemies\u2019 enclaves both in the North-west and North-east where most of their operations were being conducted to pave the way for peace and development to thrive.\n\nWhile admitting that there were challenges afflicting the war against insecurity in the country, the Army chief said with determination and the right efforts by all and sundry, \u201cthe Nigeria security challenges are surmountable.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe essence of my visit is to reinvigorate our operations and strengthen them to ensure that the troops take the fight to the enclaves of these criminals and destroy them.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are doing and this is what we will continue to do. For every place that I pass, that is my message. We must carry the battle to the enemies\u2019 enclaves both here in the North-west and even in the North-east where we are conducting them.\n\n\u201cThis is done in synergy with other services and other security agencies and indeed other stakeholders. We are all partners and together with this synergy we will achieve result, like we have seen, it has started gaining ground.\n\n\u201cThere are challenges. Sometimes, you see them, but they are not unsurmountable. With the support we have from the President and Commander-in-Chief, and with the cooperation of other service chiefs, we will get there\u201d.\n\nThe Army Chief called for effective inter-agency collaboration between civil-military and paramilitary organisations to checkmate the activities of the hoodlums within their respective areas of responsibilities in order to ward off insecurity.\n\nThe COAS, who also paid homage to the Emir of Daura, Dr. Umar Faruk Umar, appealed to traditional rulers to support the military and other security agencies by providing actionable intelligence to combat security challenges besetting some parts of the country.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff explained that traditional and religious institutions had vital roles to play in the fight against insecurity in the country.\n\nHe added that giving security operatives vital and actionable information on the whereabouts and movements of insurgents, bandits and kidnappers would help the authorities in containing the situation.\n\nHe however noted that the worrisome situation in the North-West was already improving, due to steps taken by officers and men of the Nigerian Army in synergy with other security agencies.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need more cooperation and synergy from other security agencies and relevant stakeholders, particularly traditional and religious institutions as well as community and opinion leaders to curtail or bring to the barest minimum the issue of banditry and kidnapping\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the Emir of Katsina, Dr. Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, while in audience with the Army chief, attributed the spate of insecurity pervading the nation to the activities of informants whom he termed dangerous elements fueling banditry and kidnapping in the state.\n\nThe traditional ruler also opined that lack of credible information sharing and synergy among security personnel \u201care responsible\u201d for the security challenges afflicting the country, especially the North-west region of the country.\n\nThe emir vowed to support the Nigerian Army to achieve the desired goal in its ongoing war against insecurity in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Anguished parents lament kids\u2019 continuing stay in jungle\n\nIsmail Adebayo,Birnin Kebbi\n\nEighty two of the 94 students abducted by bandits at the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State on June 17 are spending their 52nd day today with the kidnappers in the forest.\n\nThe heavily armed bandits, who came on motorcycles, entered Yauri from the neighbouring Rijau forest in Niger State, and abducted the students and staff of the school unhindered.\n\nSome students and staff, 12 in all, have since gained freedom, leaving 82 in captivity.\n\nParents of the students still with the bandits remain in anguish over the fate of their children.\n\nTheir anxiety was heightened by unconfirmed reports quoting the leader of the bandits, saying they had married the females among the students out to their members and were training the males for banditry.\n\nThe parents, on hearing this, gathered at Yauri, and after a meeting, agreed to embark on prayers.\n\nFew days ago, they also held a prayer session at Yauri for the release of their children.\n\nAt the prayer session, they expressed fear and disappointment with the state\u2019s government, alleging that they were not being told anything positive about their children still with the bandits.\n\nOne of the parents told THISDAY recently: \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what has happened to our children. Government is not telling us anything. We had made several attempts to engage government over our children that are still in the hands of bandits but we were turned down. We wanted to know what they are doing to rescue them. Their continued stay with the bandits is not good at all. We as parents are willing to do what the parents of abducted students in other places did if that will make the bandits release our children.\u201d\n\nAnother parent adds: \u201cI think it\u2019s time government engages the bandits. We are worried about our children staying with terrorists for this long. The bandits have not made any demands from us, we wouldn\u2019t know if they are making any demands on government. But we don\u2019t think it is right for government to be silent on our children\u2019s abduction. It\u2019s taken longer than expected; we don\u2019t even know what might have happened to them.

          "text": "Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe management of Wema Bank yesterday hinted that \u201cit is considering\u201d the acquisition of a fintech firm or a merger with another commercial bank, as part of its growth plans.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos during the company\u2019s half-year 2021 investors/analysts presentation (virtually), the bank\u2019s Deputy Managing Director, Moruf Oseni, said a merger and acquisition (M&A) was part of its plan to ensure organic growth.\n\nOseni said the acquisition \u201cis not limited to the financial sector space.\u201d\n\nOseni said: One of our pillars is inorganic growth. It is either you merge or acquire. It is not limited to acquiring from the Nigerian financial space or with a fintech. We are looking at all possible options this time around\n\n\u201cA merger and acquisition in terms of inorganic growth could be with another financial player in the Nigerian bank or it could potentially be with a fintech or it could be the acquisition of the smaller fintech. But as time goes on, we will engage the market on that.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at all possible options, whether you like it or not, no matter how efficient you are. In this game, we are playing skill to skill, and we also have huge aspirations to scale up in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nOseni also announced Wema Bank\u2019s plan to sell shares to existing shareholders to raise additional capital of N40 billion by September.\n\nHe said the capital raise would give the bank an expanded base of business over the coming years to compete favourably in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe rights issuance is expected to hit the market in September, this month of August is for us to have a court-ordered meeting to get shareholders together and agree on the scheme of the arrangement,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the bank would embark on a road show from next week to sensitise shareholder groups and associations on growth plans.\n\nOseni explained that the bank would reduce its shares in issue before embarking on the rights issue to ensure enhanced growth for shareholders.\n\n\u201cWema Bank today has a large number of shares in issuance, but before we float the right issue, we need to get the shareholders to reduce the shares in issue and on the back of that we then issue those rights.\n\n\u201cThis will not change the shareholding structure of the shareholders. We just want to manage the number of shares in issue, and that will impact on our ratios. It makes sense to have more efficient shares in issue before doing the rights issuance,\u201d Oseni said.\n\nHe also said that regulatory cost was among the issues that keep the bank awake at night and explained that Wema Bank \u201cis capable of containing\u201d the regulatory risk: \u201cAre we able to navigate around it? The answer is yes. The whole thing (regulatory risk) is to make sure that the Nigerian economy is bootstrapped and that there is growth in the economy. Our job is to navigate them as they are part of the business.\u201d\n\nThe bank said its operating cost moved from N17.6 billion to N20.8 billion largely due to regulatory costs like AMCON levy and NDIC premium.\n\nOseni said: \u201cThe AMCON levy grew around 50 per cent and the NDIC premium by almost 90 per cent. Between 2019 and 2020 we grew our deposit by almost 50 per cent. We will use revenue to cover the increase caused by regulatory cost. Also, costs were driven by inflation, forex and energy costs.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have started well and will end this year very well. Although the external environment is very tough we believe the opportunities are numerous and will continue to focus on growing our businesses across retail and corporate segments as we continue to execute our three year strategy to capture all the values in it and will continue to play on our digital domain.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Finance Officer of Wema Bank, Mr. Tunde Mabawonku, said during the virtual event, that the bank had started a process that would hopefully grow its capital base to N100 billion.\n\nMabawonku said: \u201cWhen the CRR dropped below 15 per cent the board approved immediate implementation of the bank\u2019s capital management plan to bring shareholders capital from existing N60 billion plus to above N100 billion mark.\u201d\n\nHe also shared insight into the bank\u2019s performance. According to him, the bank\u2019s profit before tax improved from N1.7 billion in half year 2020 to N4.3 billion in 2021 half year, while its total assets crossed the N1 trillion mark and \u201cthe margins are better than this time last year.\u201d\n\nThe chief finance officer also said that the bank had grown its deposit base to N808 billion with hope of reaching N1 trillion deposit mark\n\nHe said: \u201cGrowth is less than N500 billion in the first half of the year. But the interesting thing is that retail deposit has grown by 10 per cent.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "text": "Insurance is a critical component of living and doing business. The aftermath of the EndSARS protest in October 2020, insecurity in parts of the country that no longer allow farmers to go for harvest, and impacts of climate change on businesses, particularly Micro, Small & Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) have reignited the importance of insurance as protection option for the sector.\n\nThe need for insurance protection experts say has become very critical given the role of MSMEs as major actors in the economic development of any nation particularly job creation.\n\nAccording to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) National Survey of 2017, there are around 41.5 million SMEs in Nigeria, and they represent businesses with less than N100 million in annual turnovers and have less than 300 employees.\n\nAccording to experts, not recognizing this important sector of the economy by allowing them exposed to various kinds of avoidable risks that confront them on day to day basis is a disservice to the general well being of the economy.\n\nAt a stakeholders workshop organized by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) for sensitization on insurance for MSMES held in Lagos, the Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu said MSMEs account for nearly 50percent of the nation\u2019s GDP and contributes 80 percent of the nation\u2019s employment.\n\nRead also: CIIN continues drive for greater insurance culture\n\nSanwo-Olu who was represented by the commissioner for Finance, Lagos state, Rabiu Olowo noted that the state government cannot afford to ignore the challenges confronting MSMEs and threatening their survival.\n\n\u201cThat is why we describe our MSMEs as very resilient, if you can do business in Nigeria and thrive, there is nowhere you cannot thrive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have launched so many initiatives and strategies and are still being implemented towards providing an enabling environment for MSMEs to not only thrive but to succeed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, as a guaranteed approach to protecting small businesses against unforeseen losses and circumstances that may threaten their operations securing insurance cover must be encouraged.\n\nSanwo-Olu, therefore, tasked insurers to create special products for MSMEs, that is affordable and free from technicalities for easy assimilation with the assurance of settlement of claims.\n\nHowever, he advised insurance companies to ensure that insurance policies designed for MSMEs must meet their needs and also address the peculiarities of MSMEs.\n\n\u201cThere should be specially designed products that will meet their category, income, operations and processes such must be affordable and free of technicalities so that it can be easily understood with assurance of settlement of claims,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI enjoin all MSMEs in Lagos State to embrace insurance as a safety net against losses that might be suffered as a result of unforeseen circumstances,\u201d he urged.\n\nSunday Thomas, commissioner for Insurance speaking at the event assured that the commission is committed to its mandate of providing diligent oversight to the insurance sector towards ensuring prompt settlement of genuine claims when an insured event occurs.\n\n\u201cI dare say that the MSMEs sector is too important to be neglected as it is key to the economic development of the nation and thus, must be guided and protected against failure.\n\n\u201cThe encouraging responses validate that the products meet a critical need also that the appetite for players in the MSMEs sector to succeed sustainably is high,\u201d he said.\n\nMuftau Oyegunle, president of, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria said that the MSMEs are fundamental at core areas of its operation that it needs to expand.\n\nYetunde Ilori, director-general of the Nigerian Insurance Association urged the MSMEs to link their businesses with insurance protection. \u201cWhatever you cannot afford to lose should be insured.\u201d\n\nAbdulrasheed Babalola speaking on the benefits of Insurance to MSMEs informed the attendees that insurance protection offers financial protection, boosting production and facilitating access to finance.",

          "text": "Welcome to a new edition of Culinary Delights where we tell the stories of restaurants in Lagos and beyond. Today we visit Slow Restaurant.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on all industries, including the restaurant business, with the economic downturn and uncertainty that the pandemic has brought about, it has been refreshing to see how restauranteurs in Lagos have pivoted and innovated their way through tumultuous times.\n\nRead also: Date Night in Accra at Bistro 22\n\nOne of the most popular and exclusive spots to rise out of the COVID-19 pandemic is Slow. Slow is a tropical brasserie with influences spanning from Latin America, Central America to West Africa, located in Victoria Island on 2 Musa Yar\u2019Adua St.\n\nSlow, as the name suggests, invites us to literally take a breather and go slow. As we all experience daily, Lagos is a bustling city, it can easily be described as a hectic city, and in fact, CNN described it as one of the most stressful cities in the world. Hate it or love it, Lagos is Lagos.\n\nThe Slow Restaurant is located inside a beautiful white building reminiscent of a beautiful Italian-style building somewhere in Star Island in Miami. The building is also home to Temple Muse, a well-known lifestyle concept store. As soon as you enter the premises, your car keys will be picked up and your car driven by a valet, so you don\u2019t have to worry about parking. As you proceed on a pathway pond that leads to the restaurant, you will not miss the relaxing fountain that creates a peaceful atmosphere as you step into the restaurant lounge and are warmly greeted by a friendly host or hostess who will lead you to your reserved table.\n\nReservation reservations\n\nIn Lagos, I don\u2019t know of many restaurants where a reservation is mandatory, so many of us are not in the mindset to reserve before we venture out. Going out to eat for me is usually a last-minute spontaneous decision.\n\nSlow Lagos is the only restaurant I know where reservations are highly recommended. When they first opened, I called twice to book a table for Friday and Saturday evening, but they were fully booked. Many of my friends had told me how difficult it was to get a reservation, especially last minute. In my mind, this meant one of two things: either this place was out of this world or they had figured out a basic economics concept of supply and demand.\n\nEither way, I was eager to find out.\n\nDuring a global pandemic where many restaurants worldwide have either shut down or reduced their capacity, it is impressive that Slow Lagos does not seem to have been affected and is still going strong.\n\nI eventually got lucky and was able to make a reservation for both lunch and dinner on two different dates without mentioning that I would write a review.\n\nThe ambience, food, and drinks\n\nThe menu offers a large variety of starters and main dishes cooked with a mix of ancient cooking methods redesigned to meet the modern diners\u2019 needs. Slow is heavily influenced by Latin American flavours with an international touch set in a casual, yet luxurious and lush atmosphere.\n\nThey grow most of their herbs and vegetables on their indoor and outdoor hydroponic farms, which I think is pretty cool. They also have a pretty impressive cocktail bar designed to give a classic, lavish but approachable, and friendly experience where you will discover new flavours with the help of their creative bartenders. Slow offers indoor and outdoor seating and several different dining options such as booths, high tables, and dining on the bar. I absolutely loved the food both times I had the pleasure to visit.\n\nLunchtime\n\nAs a starter, I opted for the seabass ceviche, a Peruvian style fresh seabass with avocado, jalapeno, cucumber, lime, green apple, prickled onion, finished with coriander oil, and also had the duck confit and roast potatoes as a main meal. My friend had the lamb chops. The food was exquisite. We were quite satisfied so there was no room for the desert.\n\nDinner time\n\nI went to Slow a second time to celebrate an anniversary and I had the oysters, which were freshly shucked to order. Succulent! They were fresh and the perfect way to start the dinner. I then had the lamb chops as a main dish, accompanied with a side of mashed potatoes. My friends had the shrimp tacos and the salmon fillet on Peruvian rice. We both thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.\n\nIs Slow Lagos the most exclusive restaurant in Lagos?\n\nThe reputation of Slow Lagos is not a simple \u2018hype\u2019, it is well deserved: it is great food cooked really well and tastefully presented. The ambience and infrastructure of the space are perfect. Their perfected botanical garden meets Miami quite spectacularly. It was an exquisite eating experience each time.\n\nI give thumbs up to the quality and presentation of the food, the service, interior and exterior design, ambience, cleanliness, and even value for money.\n\nOne con is that if you decide to just walk in, you may want to have a plan B, especially on Weekends. Slow Lagos is currently the only restaurant in Lagos where it is highly recommended to make reservations before showing up. But is it a well thought out strategy? Could it be that Slow Lagos understood that a full restaurant and unavailability of reservations nurtures people\u2019s curiosity about the restaurant and makes its fame?\n\nRating\n\n5/5\n\n1 2 3 4 5 Poor.Nothing good. Okay but no interest in visiting again. Good. May think about returning for that particular cuisine. Excellent.Delicious food, appealing atmosphere, helpful staff, and brilliant service. Extraordinary. Meets a high standard: The staff is always ready to help, the premises are extremely clean, the atmosphere is lovely, and the food is both delicious and beautifully presented.\n\nIf you want an extraordinary dining experience, I highly recommend Slow restaurant.

          "title": "Explainer: How global skills partnership may change Nigeria\u2019s brain drain to gain",
          "text": "Skills partnership is one way that may reverse its brain drain trend. It has been said severally and in a multitude of ways that Nigeria is suffering a brain drain, as its youth population actively emigrates to developed economies for better work opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, some countries in Europe are seeing rapid decreases in their working-age populations. This poses a problem for employers in these countries as they are facing significant skill shortages needed for the growth and sustainability of their economies.\n\nAccording to data on population estimates and projections from US Census Bureau International Data Base (IDB), a global demographic product, by 2050 the estimated working age (15-64) population of Nigeria would increase by 120.8 percent while some developed European countries like Spain, Germany, Russia and Italy will reduce by 25.4 percent, 21.0 percent, 18.3 percent and 14.4 percent respectively.\n\nThis means Nigeria and these European countries are at risk of two different employment challenges in the next 30 years. For Nigeria, more people would be needing jobs, while for these European countries; fewer people would be available to work.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, a report titled \u2018Expanding Legal Migration Pathways from Nigeria to Europe: From Brain Drain to Brain Gain,\u2019 by the World Bank and the Centre for Global Development (CGD), outlines how the Global Skill Partnership model could be used to solve brain drain in Nigeria and shortage of skills in Europe.\n\nWhat the Global Skill Partnership model is all about\n\nIn 2012, the Global Skill Partnership model was first proposed by Michael Clemens, an American development economist. It is a bilateral labour migration model that ensures mobility contributes to development for both countries of origin and destination.\n\nIt is also an exchange between equal partners where the country of destination agrees to provide technology and finance to train potential migrants with targeted skills in the country of origin, prior to migration, and gets migrants with the precise skills they need in order to integrate and contribute their best upon arrival.\n\n\u201cIt aims to build the global stock of skilled workers, ensuring some remain within the country of origin, thereby combating brain drain and ensures there is a steady stream of investment going into improving both training and systems overall, thereby compensating countries of origin for producing qualified workers for markets abroad,\u201d the report stated.\n\nRead also: Brain Drain 3.0: The exodus that\u2019s not being televised\n\nHow the model works\n\nThe model best fits Nigeria due to its large and growing working-age population and the country\u2019s inability to absorb its increasing working-age population into the labour market.\n\nFor example, if Germany (country of destination), which currently suffers from nurses shortages, decides to train semi-skilled labour in Nigeria with a small fraction of the cost in a three-year nursing program, at the end of the training, some of the trainees could decide to stay in Nigeria to find jobs, while the rest could fill Germany\u2019s labour shortages.\n\nSo, the model doesn\u2019t mean taking away from some to give to others.\n\n\u201cIf we have well governed infrastructures at local and federal state level that support capacity development, a mutually beneficial global skills development program would be attractive and gain more traction from potential international investors,\u201d Jennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, an international human resource consultancy, said.\n\nShe further added that investors will now see where they are injecting their resources into, and those resources are catering to a target audience (such as Gen Z) that will build a sustainable future of tomorrow.\n\nCountries that the model is tested\n\nAlthough the model is relatively new, it has been built on many related models that have been tested around the world. According to CDG, a particularly innovative cluster of these policy tools has been built by the German development agency, (GIZ).\n\n\u201cGIZ has created a number of bilateral agreements with developing countries to prepare potential migrants\u2014before they leave\u2014to arrive and quickly make a positive contribution to Germany in mid-skill occupations. There have been nurses from Vietnam, hospitality workers from Morocco, construction workers from Kosovo, and many others,\u201d CDG cited.\n\nAnother example is Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which established the Australia Pacific Training Coalition (APTC) in 2005. It was created to improve the supply of labour and the alignment of skills with jobs among Pacific Island countries and increase labour mobility between the Pacific and Australia.\n\nAnd due to its success, a new labour mobility track was created in 2021 which will ensure some graduates are prepared to take up labour mobility opportunities within the region, to Australia, New Zealand and beyond, and access semi-skilled opportunities.\n\nTech companies in Africa may have been using the model\n\nSince 2014, Andela has been training software developers in Africa and hiring them out to global tech companies. Also, last year Microsoft launched a global skills initiative to train 25 million people worldwide in digital skills.\n\n\u201cNigeria should take the lead from the private sector especially on the Tech-space to train the under-skilled so they are well positioned for career opportunities especially now that remote working has now been welcomed by the Nigerian Market,\u201d Oyelade advised.\n\nHow Nigeria can implement the model successfully\n\nThe World Bank and CGD recommends that Nigeria and a partner country choose a sector to focus and collaborate on as the first step to implement the model.\n\nThe organisations also suggested sectors that the country can focus on with partner countries such as a health care partnership between Nigeria and the UK, a construction partnership between Nigeria and Germany, and an information and communications technology (ICT) partnership with various European states.\n\nRisks involved\n\nThere are a number of risks inherent within the design and implementation of the model such as the lobbying of trade unions, a lack of language training, skill mismatch, imbalanced incentives, a lack of stakeholder coordination, security concerns, and a lack of employer interest.\n\n\u201cInterested governments must be aware of these risks and develop plans to mitigate them throughout the design and implementation of the partnership,\u201d the report highlighted",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nA construction engineer, Engr. Aneru Izuagbe, Managing Director of Amineru Enterprises Limited and his wife Amina are farmers who are calling for support and collaboration to boost their small scale food packaging business.\n\nThe whole idea of the business started when Amina, a Secretarial administration graduate who has been involved in several kinds of businesses before she got married to Aneru discussed with her husband sometime around 2012 that she would stop eating pounded yam and instead take wheat.\n\nThat was how she started buying wheat and milling the delicacy to eat and as time goes by she was able to convince the husband to start taking wheat as a meal as well. It was at this point she was able to mill enough wheat and people bought from her.\n\nWhen they started with just wheat, the response was so impressive and they saw it as a lucrative business. They then applied to NAFDAC for registration for the production of wheat after the inspection of the premises which was one of their buildings.\n\nIt was the NAFDAC officials who advised on the need to use the back flat of the building as a factory. They took the samples to their laboratory at Onitsha, took the test to their headquarters in Lagos and eventually, they were given NAFDAC certification.\n\nIt was initially certification for wheat, plantain and then groundnut and pepper soup and they all have the NAFDAC number. They have also gone into garri- cassava farming, with the acquisition of a large farm land from where they get their cassava raw materials. They also have a farm for plantain which they hope to harvest by next year.\n\nSpeaking with the NIGERIAN OBSERVER in their factory in Benin City, Engr. Aneru and the wife who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Business said there are great potentials in food consumables because people eat them every day, adding that all they have to ensure is that they have good products and good packaging.\n\n\u201cWe have attended various seminars and trainings on packaging and quality control which have assisted us to come out with the packages we are using now. At the same time we are already up grading this to the type that is transparent for people to see the products that are inside.\n\n\n\nIn the words of Engr. Aneru who is a University of Benin trained Engineer, they have acquired several other certifications such as from the US food and drugs administration. \u201cThis is the US version of NAFDAC. Their consultants in Nigeria came to the factory, took samples and looked at our setup and we passed their test and they gave us their certification.\n\n\u201cThis means that our products can enter the United States market unhindered and we are also registered with the Nigeria Export Promotion Council which regulates export activities within Nigeria. We are also members of Edo Shippers association where Sir Bibowei Braie is our vice president in matters of shipping, import and export business.\n\n\u201cWe are also members of the Nigeria \u2013 German chambers of commerce. The Edo Exporters clusters and we are finalizing our registration with Benin Chambers of Commerce and Industry BENCCIMA.\n\nAccording to him, they are doing all these to create a way for their products to go very wide and create a market, but the challenge he noted has been the productive capacity which is still limited, especially within these last two years with the arrival of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur operations were actually hampered. Before now all those containers you see there are always filled up because we stock them during the season. Plantain has gone off season now, maybe in another one or two month\u2019s time they will begin to come\n\n\u201cDuring that season, we peel, we dry and we stock them in the containers so that we are able to produce all year round. But these last two months production was really low because when plantain came out it became expensive.\n\n\u201cPeople did not go to the farm enough to be able to have enough and to get it was difficult and for us to produce, we stock it at a high cost. It used to be N600 when we started. Last year it was N1000 and now it is N1, 200 because the packaging cost has increased and the raw materials, costs of fueling, diesel have also increased.\n\nHe however, noted that because of the passion for the business and knowing that they will be able to get there with a little encouragement they are very optimistic.\n\nWhile commending the Vice President of the Shippers Council, Sir B. Braie as one of their major supporter and mentor, he disclosed that he was instrumental for their membership of Edo Shippers Association.\n\n\u201cThe Shippers Council were here a couple of weeks ago to find out how we were doing and their coming gave us the encouragement that we really need. We are looking ahead of being like the Dangote\u2019s flour.\n\n\u201cWe know our competitors in the market and we try as much as possible to associate with those that will help us to be above board, he added.\n\nThe Amineru Enterprises Limited started with a small savings but along the line they have been approaching finance bodies, but because of the interest rates of banks they could not access any facility from them.\n\nThe bank of Agriculture and bank of Industry have visited the factory, but their terms are unfriendly. They are also close to the Edo State government, they have attended almost all the trade fairs, Alaghodaro and they are members of Edojobs, an agency of the state government.\n\nThey have attended several government sponsored seminars and the first lady of Edo State, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki who is from the Bank of Industry has seen the products in various seminars and she has called the Edo state manager to attend to us.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have all been here, but their conditions are still very high, we have tried to hire a consultant, Edijala and Co to help source for funds but at the end of the day the conditions are not favorable.\n\n\u201cWhere we had a breakthrough was when NIRSAL micro finance bank was created by the Central bank and a friend of ours who knew about this called us in 2018, and then we were in the village during the Christmas.\n\n\u201cWe had to rush back to Benin and we applied for the programme and luckily we got intervention from NIRSAL last year and we were able to purchase this generator, the drier and other cassava equipment.\n\n\u201cThe intervention was at five percent interest with four years repayment period and we are servicing it right now. Seventy percent of that intervention was invested on equipment, and thirty percent is given to us to do all other things and it is from there they take their insurance, management fee and what we have we use to run our consumables and raw materials for the season.\n\n\u201cWe have the equipment now, but what we actually need now is the support to get the raw materials. Like this packaging cost about N2.5m to get the kind of packaging we want to go into to get ten thousand copies.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to do half of that and the printing is ongoing now, but definitely we would need to bring out the balance to be able to take delivery at the middle of August this year. I can guarantee the product because people like it and they are looking forward to have it.\n\n\u201cLike today we are supplying JARRA and Anambra super markets. The market is there. These are how far we have been able to access support from financial institutions and we are looking for other ways that we can get grants, stress free loans at very low interest.\n\n\u201cThe market guarantees that we would be able to service such loans because we are a small scale business. But with the loans from Banks with interest rates of about twenty to twenty two percent, there is no way we can meet up. Those kinds of supports are good for big firms or factories that have attained very high status. We are trying to upscale, therefore commercial banks are out of it,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further disclosed that the vision of the Business is to make the products available in the next shop, to be available outside the shores of Nigeria and to ensure that if a customer goes to any open market, any major super market they would be able to find the products there.\n\nHe assured that the quality will be maintained because every day they are striving to improve on the quality, saying that before they do any batch it is taken to the University of Benin for Laboratory analysis.\n\n\u201cWe are working towards having the Lab in-house here in the factory because for every test conducted we pay N20, 000 for every batch. Even at that, we are not sure until it stays on the shelve for a year without losing its quality. For you to be sure it will not lose quality you have to be sure of the moisture content.\n\n\u201cWe just do not package blindly like that, because we have a standard which we do not want to come down from. But with N500, 000 we can have our own in- house laboratory.\n\nOn the vision of the business, he said: \u201cWe are looking at getting to the level where Amineru unripe plantain flour, Amineru garri and Amineru beans flour is available. You can send your son to go to the road side store to get any of our products, that is where we want to be and we are working gradually towards that level.\n\nWhen at the peak of production, the factory produces about two hundred kg every day and the investment on equipment and the building so far is about seventy million.\n\nBut, the support the factory require to expand to get the products to every house hold is about N2.5m for the packaging, and for the purchase of a garri processing equipment that will be used from peeling to finished products in one straight line without going through hard labour will cost about five thousand dollars. Therefore with another N20m the factory will be ready and set to go.\u201d\n\nIn his words, though they have not officially received any request for partnership, he however noted that they are open to anyone or organization coming to invest to help expand the business so that they can share the proceeds depending on the investment levels.\n\nHe pointed out that this is one of the ways the business can be expanded, it can become a public liability company, not necessarily a family business. But at the moment it is only the family that has invested in the business.\n\nWhile calling on anyone interested in putting in their share capital to expand the business, Engr. Aneru and the wife enthused, \u201cwe are open to such collaboration, either in terms of cash, in terms of equipment or any initiative; we are very open to ensure Amineru brand expands nationally and internationally.\u201d\n\n...",

There was 97 percent rate of these businesses actually paying back their facilities.\n\n\u201cWe want MSMEs in the state to improve on how to keep records of activities in their businesses, as this will benefit their business.\n\n\u201cOZE will be our private partner in our MSMEs clinics.

Gone are the days when people see facilities as national cake\u201d\n\nOn his part, OZE\u2019s Country Lead, Mr. Iyke Idupkaye, noted, \u201cOZE is both an app as well as a platform. It is an application that provides entrepreneurs with a simple interface and process of inputting all the things they sell, expenses, activities, and transactions on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cIt is so easy that it becomes a habit which is actually our goal to make them form the habit.

          "text": "By Chimeziri Franklin\n\nSince ancient times, it has been understood that governance forms part of the economy of a state or organization. Plato the philosopher taught that while every citizen should play a role in government, the most important place in ruling should be reserved for the most learned and most knowledgeable of the citizenry. Accordingly, Kings invested in tutoring their likely successors. Philip of Macedonia, desiring to unite Greece and rule over her himself and his descendants, ensured that his heir got the best political and military training and knew the benefits and dynamics of industry and trade. One of the sound minds who taught the young prince is Plato. Named Alexander, this student became king and added kingdoms and empires to Greek dominion, expanding it to Persia, Egypt and India.\n\nProf Chukwuma Soludo, more than Alexander the Great, exemplifies knowledge power.\n\nOn the heels of success in learning, leadership came early to Soludo. He became the all-subjects best in his class in primary school and was appointed a prefect. In high school he came tops consistently in all subjects and was appointed as prefect. In the university when he was studying B.Sc Economics, he remained on course to First Class Honours and was elected president of the Students Union.\n\nAfter earning a doctorate, he has been a lecturer in Economics at some of the world\u2019s top universities as well as a consultant to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank and the African Union and has emerged as a Professor of Economics and an author of articles offering a convincing roadmap for taking Nigeria and other Third World countries away from economic disadvantage.\n\nOne day he was busy at his office at the Institute of Applied Economics when his phone rang and it was President Olusegun Obasanjo naming him Chief Economic Adviser to the President and Chairman of the National Planning Commission. A friend of the president\u2019s recommended the young professor when told that the president needed an economist who understands development. The man, an older professor of economics had read a Soludo article and marvelled at the prescription for national development.\n\nSoludo got cracking and soon rolled out for the Obasanjo Administration the National Empowerment And Economic Development Strategy (NEEDS). For the State governments, he came up with the State Empowerment And Economic Development Strategy (SEEDS). Obasanjo became a leader with a great plan for his country. Thus, when the position of Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) became vacant, Obasanjo gave the position to Soludo since the new position would give the economic strategist a better opportunity to implement his ideas.\n\nProf Soludo had long realized that Nigeria will be better off with twenty-five strong, globally competitive banks than with seventy very weak banks that break depositors\u2019 hearts. So as CBN Governor, he required each bank to raise their assetbase to 25million naira or stop operating. To meet this requirement, many banks merged. That is how Nigerians became partakers of the wealth in global banking.\n\nDid CBN governor Soludo neglect Ndigbo while serving Nigeria so well? No! He\u2019s too sensible for that. He bullt branches of the CBN in Abakaliki, Asaba, Awka, Umuahia and Owerri thereby bringing the services of the apex financial institution closer to Ndigbo. He ensured that NdiAnambra got a fair share of contracts and jobs.\n\nNo wonder, elites and commoners across the three senatorial zones of the state are united in getting Soludo to vie for Anambra State governorship. No wonder APGA the great party of Ndigbo have raised Soludo\u2019s hands as their champion.\n\nSoludo\u2019s proposal to develop the entire state to a Smart Mega City and his being seen \u201cas a thinker and a doer of good things\u201d is making things easier for his supporters.\n\nNo doubt, Prof Soludo has captured the very relevant knowledge position in the perceptual maps of NdiAnambra ahead of the governorship election slated for November this year.\n\nChimeziri Franklin writes from Aba, Umuahia and PH.",

          "title": "Arms Control Commission And The Task Of Mopping Up Over 350m Guns",
          "text": "Amidst the increase in the proliferation of small arms and ammunition in the country, security experts have said the menace is driving the skyrocketing rate of insecurity and violence in the nation.\n\nThey noted that the proliferation of arms, occasioned by illegal and porous borders and the booming business of gun-running, is fuelling Nigeria\u2019s security challenges, giving rise to criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe security experts who spoke to LEADERSHIP said the proliferation of arms portends the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s borders to the spread of insurgency, compounded by the fact that Niger and Cameroon had borders with the northern Nigerian states, where Boko Haram already exerts a strong influence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReport said there are 500 million illegal arms in West Africa out of which 350 million which constitute 70 percent are in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Statista 2021, Boko Haram Terrorists have between 2011-2021 killed 32,820 people in Borno State, 4,009 in Adamawa, 3,804 in Kaduna, 3,705 in Zamfara,3,705 in Benue, 2,929 in Yobe, and 2854 in Plateau States.\n\nNigeria is ranked second highest in the world in terrorist attacks after Afghanistan. With the proliferation of arms, several militant groups are active in Nigeria, leading to attacks on both civilian and military targets.\n\nSome deaths are also been attributed to conflicts among other herdsmen, farmers, and communal clashes.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2021, over 20 thousand Nigerians have been killed by Boko Haram Terrorists, Kidnappers, armed robbers, and ethnic militias.\n\nEstablished by the Executive Order of the President on 3 May 2021, the National Center for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) is mandated to mop up the over 350m arms in the hands of non-state actors.\n\nHowever, the commission regrettably did not meet the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Small Arms of which Nigeria is a signatory in streamlining all efforts of eradication of illicit arms in the West African sub-region.\n\nThe NCCSALW has therefore partnered with Service Chiefs of military and paramilitary agencies to combat illicit arms flows in Nigeria.\n\nThe national coordinator, NCCSALW Major General Abba Mohammed Dikko (Rtd) while soliciting the support of service chiefs when he separately visited the Chief of Defence Staff General Lucky Irabor, Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Marshal Oladayo Amao and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Alkali Baba Usman in Abuja recently said the move became imperative to galvanize the whole-of-nation support in order to bring onboard stakeholders and civil society organisations in line with the guidelines enshrined in the UN and ECOWAS protocols.\n\nAccordingly, he said the NCCSALW intends to aggregate all weapons and related materials that have been mopped up from the society and manage the stockpile leading up to its destruction.\n\nThe Centre also plans to institutionalize the process of marking all weapons holdings of security agencies and maintain a national database that would help to keep track of all small arms and light weapons in the country to ensure traceability in case the weapons fall into wrong hands.\n\nIn a statement by the director of strategic communications and information, National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, Group Captain Ewejide Akintunde, Dikko said the purpose of the visit was to acquaint the various chiefs with the core functions of NCCSALW.\n\nHe said all stakeholders\u2019 support was needed in the actualisation of the centres\u2019 objectives.\n\nGen Dikko explained that the NCCSALW was established on 3 May 2021 following an executive order by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, and he was appointed the pioneer National Coordinator of the Centre on 6 May 2021.\n\nHe highlighted that the Centre was intended to serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research, and monitoring of all aspects of small arms and light weapons in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn view of this, the centre will be promoting policy actions through networking and advocacy in close collaboration with government agencies, civil society organisations, security sector institutions, development partners, and international organisations,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response, the Chief of Defence Staff congratulated the national coordinator on his appointment and thanked him for the visit.\n\nHe noted that the establishment of the Centre was long overdue given the current state of insecurity in the nation.\n\nThe CDS further reiterated that research and experience revealed that the state of insecurity in the nation is attributable to the illicit proliferation of arms in the society.\n\nHe, therefore, commended the National Coordinator for the effort made thus far in the operationalisation of the Centre and implored the National Coordinator not to relent his effort in concretising the core functions of the centre.\n\nGen Irabor said the significant reduction of illicit arms flows was a collective responsibility of all stakeholders, therefore, all hands must be on deck in this fight against insecurity in the nation.\n\nHe further pledged to give his maximum support in the actualisation of the Centre\u2019s objectives which aims at the eradication of illicit arms in the country.\n\nOn his part, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Amao, thanked the National Coordinator for the visit and highlighted the importance of collaboration with key stakeholders in combating the illicit proliferation of arms in the society.\n\nWhile congratulating the National Coordinator on his appointment as the pioneer National Coordinator of the Centre, he noted that the decision to have a body with the responsibility of controlling and combatting the proliferation of SALW in the country is part of efforts to rejig the security architecture of the nation.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the Centre to remain resolute until they attain success in their mission noting that the success of the NCCSALW would equally translate to the success of the Armed Forces and other security agencies in the fight against crimes and all forms of criminalities.\n\nAir Marshal Amao further reiterated that intelligence sharing is key to the actualisation of the objectives of the Centre and therefore advised that the Centre should strive towards the development of structures needed to effectively create and sustain intelligence sharing between both organisations.\n\nThe CAS, therefore, pledged to give his maximum support to the Centre in the actualisation of its objectives.\n\nAlso, the IGP Usman applauded the establishment of the Centre, adding that the creation of the Centre was all in the interest of peace and security as well as crime prevention and control.\n\nHe expressed delight in the opportunity to share the art of crime control and mopping of illicit arms with the Centre.\n\nWhile pledging to give his full support to the Centre in the areas of intelligence sharing, capacity development, and use of instruments of the INTERPOL, the IGP however, expressed concerns about some organisations impersonating the NCCSALW and mimicking the assigned functions of the Centre.\n\nThe IGP disclosed that the Nigeria Police is on the heels of such organisations impersonating the legally established NCCSALW and would not relent in its efforts to bring them to book.\n\nHe, therefore, stressed the impact of illegal production and possession of weapons of various types within the country.\n\nDespite challenges faced by the Nigeria Police, the IGP asserted that efforts are on top gear in checkmating the menace of unlawful arms in the society.\n\nThe IGP acknowledged tracing and law enforcement cooperation as the primary tools that would assist in combating the proliferation of illicit arms in the society.\n\nHe, therefore, pledged that the Nigeria Police would give its maximum support to the NCCSALW in the achievement of its objectives.\n\nThough laudable, the government must address those issues that brought about the rising insecurity and win the trust of every Nigerian. It is time to silence the guns and push for national development initiatives.",

Babakura Abba Jato, said the expanded security council meeting had in attendance members of the State Executive Council, traditional rulers under the leadership of the Shehu of Borno and all Service Chiefs in the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said the governor registered his utmost appreciation over the effort of the Nigerian Armed Forces, paramilitaries, civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes for bringing down the level of insurgency in the state to the barest minimum level.\n\nHe said Zulum called on them to increase their efforts so that the whole state will be free and normalcy will return.\n\n\u201cZulum most particularly expressed his gratitude for the clearing exercise in the shores of the Lake Chad and the Sambisa general area, noting that although the factional leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, was killed, a new group is taking over Shekau\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cHe said the establishment of civil authorities is one of the highest priorities of government. The issue was reiterated while explaining that, if civil authorities are not established in reclaimed territories, those areas will be taken over by the insurgents.\n\n\u201cAs a result, all efforts will be geared towards bringing people back to their ancestral homes,\u201d Jato said.\n\nHe added that by November, people from Abadam residing in Niger Republic will be brought back to Nigeria and settled in their local government area.\n\nOn demotion of a church in Maiduguri, he said that the governor has already issued out a statement and immediately set up committee of inquiry and investigation was ongoing on the incident.\n\n\u201cWhen the outcome of the investigation is out, the general public will be adequately informed, and justice will take its course at the end of the enquiry.\n\n\u201cHowever, the governor made it clear that his administration will not condone any form of indiscipline or breach of law by any individual.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Deputy Governor of Borno State, Umar Usman Kadafur, under the directives of the governor has visited the victims and sympathized with them,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the government will also embark on the clearance of Maiduguri-Damboa road in preparation for opening and easy movement of people and goods.\n\n\u201cThe governor enjoined members of the public to be very vigilant and report any suspicious persons or activity to the security agencies,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nA Ghanaian fraudster, Tourey Ahmed Rufai who fled to Ghana after he was sentenced to four years in prison, was extradited to the United States on Friday to serve his sentence.\n\nThe former Bronx resident was arrested in Ghana on 14 April, before he was extradited on 6 August.\n\nAudrey Strauss, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, along with other officials, announced Rufai\u2019s extradition.\n\nRufai, a/k/a \u201cJoe Thompson,\u201d a/k/a \u201cJoe Terry,\u201d a/k/a \u201cRufai A Tourey,\u201d a/k/a \u201cAhmed Rufai Tourey,\u201d was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote on 12 April, 2019.\n\nIt was in connection with his participation in a fraud scheme based in Ghana involving the theft of over $10 million through business email compromises and romance scams.\n\nThe gang targeted elderly victims from at least 2014 through 2018.\n\nAccording to court filings in Manhattan Federal Court:\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, RUFAI, was a member of a criminal enterprise, based in Ghana that was involved in defrauding more than 100 American businesses and individuals of more than $10 million through business email compromises and romance scams.\n\nRUFAI and his co-conspirators received or otherwise directed the receipt of millions of dollars in fraud proceeds from victims of the Enterprise in bank accounts that they controlled in the Bronx, New York.\n\nSome of these bank accounts were opened using fake names, stolen identities, or shell companies in order to avoid detection and hide the true identities of the members of the Enterprise controlling those accounts.\n\nOnce the defendants received the fraud proceeds in bank accounts under their control, the defendants withdrew, transported, and laundered those fraud proceeds to other members of the Enterprise, including those located in Ghana.\n\nRUFAI, 33, was released on bail shortly after his arrest on January 9, 2018, on conditions including a $150,000 bond co-signed by three individuals, surrender of all travel documents, and home detention with electronic monitoring through an ankle bracelet.\n\nAt his trial, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud on January 9, 2019.\n\nIn addition to a prison term of four years, he was also on 12 April, 2019 sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit $109,868.61 and pay restitution of $320,449.97 to victims.\n\nThe court ordered him to self-surrender to prison on May 24, 2019.\n\nThen, on May 12, 2019, 12 days prior to his surrender date, U.S. Pretrial Services learned that the defendant\u2019s ankle bracelet had been removed and that the defendant had fled.\n\nA bench warrant was thereafter issued for the defendant\u2019s arrest.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, after the defendant\u2019s bond was forfeited, the defendant was arrested in Ghana pending his extradition to the United States to serve his sentence.\n\nManhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: \u201cWhen a defendant released on bail like Tourey Ahmed Rufai cuts his ankle bracelet and flees the country, it is an affront to the victims of his crimes and the Court.\n\n\u201cThanks to the extraordinary work of the FBI, IRS-CI, and our law enforcement partners both in the United States and in Ghana, this fugitive was apprehended in Ghana and has been returned to the United States to serve his four-year sentence.\u201d\n\nFBI Acting Assistant Director Jacqueline Maguire said: \u201cJustice will now rightfully be delivered \u2013 both to Mr. Rufai as he serves his prison sentence, and to the innocent victims from whom he stole millions of dollars.\n\nMs. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and IRS-CI in locating RUFAI in Ghana so that he could be arrested by Ghanaian law enforcement.\n\nMs. Strauss also thanked the FBI Legal Attach\u00e9 in Accra, Ghana, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of International Affairs of the Department\u2019s Criminal Division, the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nHe also thanked Ghana\u2019s Economic and Organised Crime Office, Interpol \u2013 Ghana Police Service\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division, Ghana National Security, and the Ministry of Justice & Attorney General\u2019s Office of Ghana, for their assistance in the extradition of RUFAI to the United States.\n\nThe prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Sagar K. Ravi is in charge of the prosecution.",

The tools developed are a first step in providing a voice to the victims as it allows them to share their experiences, help service providers facilitate referral pathways, and provide comprehensive protection services.\u201d\n\nAlso, the IOM Nigerian Chief of Mission, Franz Celestin was quoted in the statement as saying that, \u201cThis initiative will strengthen the identification process and ensure that more VoTs are referred to the right services.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the profiling exercise would strengthen the understanding of Trafficking in Persons in Nigeria and inform the development of national policies and future programming.\n\nAccording to him, data collected from screening activities will be disaggregated by sex, age, forms of exploitation, and other relevant indicators. The aim of the identification tools is to provide first-line officials with harmonized tools to effectively identify and refer victims of human trafficking in line with the National Referral Mechanism.\n\nHe explained that the process for the development of the tools commenced in November 2020 and received reviews from relevant stakeholders to ensure that the tools are comprehensive and stand the test of time.\n\nCelestin said the tools will be piloted in Edo, Lagos, and Delta states where NAPTIP officials would be trained on how to use them, adding that screening and reporting tools will be rolled out along the Nigerian border at points of entry and exit.\n\n\u201cVictims of human trafficking need to be protected to ensure they live a life of integrity devoid of any form of dehumanization and degrading treatment\u201d the statement quoted NAPTIP Director-General Sen. Basheer Garba Mohammed.\n\nNigerian Pilot gathered that since 2017, IOM Nigeria has provided support to 21,771 returnees of which 2,302 are VOTs.\n\nThe long-term goal is to ensure these tools are integrated into an information management system, IMS, that all stakeholders can easily access.",

          "text": "Chances of an amicable and swift resolution of the dispute between striking resident doctors and the Federal Government took a hit on Friday as both sides stuck to their positions, trading accusations.\n\nThe Federal Government insists that the doctors have no basis for the strike they started on Monday and has asked them to resume work, but the doctors say the government must honour their agreement and meet their demands before they pick up their tools again.\n\nOn Friday morning, the President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, said the striking doctors will not heed the call made by the Minister of Health a day earlier asking them to resume work.\n\nDr Osagie Ehanire said on Thursday that there was no basis for the nationwide strike as most of the issues raised by the doctors (seven out of 12) were the responsibility of state governments and not the Federal Government. According to him, the five issues that the Federal Government were responsible for were already being addressed.\n\nBut NARD disagreed, faulting the government\u2019s approach to the matter.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have signed an MOA (memorandum of agreement) with us and (say) everything you have said, and you have not even called us since the beginning of 2nd of August, 8 am, when the strike started,\u201d the NARD President said during an appearance on Channels TV\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you\u2019re telling us is that we signed a document and we are not honouring it, (and) we need to resume work. They need to stand up to their responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThis position, and the subsequent refusal of the striking doctors to resume work, angered the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige who threatened to utilise all the labour laws and tools at his disposal to ensure that the doctors face consequences for the strike. This includes the \u201cNo work, No pay\u201d rule.\n\nDr Ngige is also not ready to negotiate with the doctors.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t meet them,\u201d the visibly angry minister said when asked about the possibility of talks between both parties during an appearance on Politics Today on Friday night.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t; because I have other things to do\u201d.\n\nLike the Health Minister, Dr Ngige argues that it was wrong for the doctors to have gone on strike being essential workers.\n\nHe also dismissed the position of the doctors that the Federal Government had not communicated with them or fulfilled the terms of the agreement reached on April 10 when they suspended an earlier strike.\n\nRather than hold talks with the doctors, the minister said he invoked the \u201cno work, no pay\u201d rule on Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThey will not receive money for the period that they are on strike and it will never count for a pensionable position in their career,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if that was a fair position, the minister declared that \u201cthat\u2019s what it is\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven the ILO supports it because they (doctors) offer essential services,\u201d he said, adding that they were not supposed to go on strike without notifying him 15 days prior.\n\nAlthough the minister admitted that NARD sent him \u201ca communique\u201d of their meeting, detailing their grievances and the resolution to go on strike, it was not the same as a trade dispute notification which he insists is what they ought to have sent to him.\n\nOfficials of NARD maintain that the government left them with no other choice than to go on strike as the issues resident doctors were facing were serious ones.\n\n\u201cUsually there is no negotiation done until we go on a strike,\u201d said the President of the Association of Resident Doctors at the National Hospital in Abuja, Dr Akanimo Ebong told Channels Television on Monday when the strike started.\n\nThe doctors are seeking the immediate payment of all salaries owed to all house officers, including March salaries (regardless of quota system).\n\nThey are also asking for an upward review of the hazard allowance to 50 per cent of consolidated basic salaries of all health workers and the payment of the outstanding COVID-19 inducement allowance, especially in state-owned-tertiary institutions, among other things.\n\nThis time around, even the strike has not led to talks, and with both sides maintaining their position, the strike has dragged into a sixth day, amid concerns that it can have major implications for health care delivery in the country and the race to halt the spread of COVID-19.",

Read your packaged food labels and stay away from the ones that contain high fructose corn syrup and sucrose.\n\nOpt for food items that have low glycemic index like brown rice, unripe plantain and beans because they release glucose slowly into your bloodstream so that your body doesn\u2019t demand too much insulin secretion at once.\n\nIncrease consumption of natural unprocessed fats like avocados, nuts and olive oil which stimulate insulin the least.\n\nTrust me, fat is not the enemy, just know that they are calorie dense so you have to be careful with your portions.\n\nConsume higher fiber meals prior to your fasting window. if you\u2019re going to be fasting from 8pm to 12noon, you should eat foods that are high in fiber like vegetables when you have dinner by 7pm \u2013 8pm.\n\nWhat this does is it allows you stay satiated for a longer period of time.\n\nYou can drink alcohol in moderation during your feeding window.\n\nIt\u2019s best if you can avoid it but if not, avoid dessert wines and cocktails because they\u2019re usually packed with sugar.\n\nRed wine is the best type to have.\n\nWhen should you workout while intermittent fasting? It can be during or after your fasting window but for better weight loss results, I\u2019d recommend working out within your fasting window.\n\nA study published by the journal of physiology recorded that when you workout in a fasted state, you burn significantly more fat because the body takes little bits of fat from the muscles to the bloodstream and burns them for fuel while you workout.\n\nPlease talk to your doctor if you\u2019re taking medications for type one or two diabetes because your blood sugar levels will reduce when you\u2019re fasting and if you\u2019re already taking medications to regulate blood sugar on top of that, it may get too low and that\u2019s a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nArinola Odunuga",

It was the second time the two teams had met in the competition, with France having inflicted the USA\u2019s first Games loss since 2004 in the group stage.\n\nHowever, Gregg Popovich\u2019s favourites, who under-performed in the build-up, hit their stride when it mattered most.\n\nKevin Durant was the USA\u2019s standout player yet again, scoring 29 points.\n\nFrance made a late, fourth-quarter run, but came up just short as the US made their shots at crucial moments to claim a seventh gold medal out of the last eight on offer.\n\n\u201cThe first time we played together as a whole roster was France [in the group] and lost to them,\u201d said Jrue Holiday. \u201cSo we just felt like it was only right to meet them in gold and to get our win back.\u201d\n\nTeam USA\u2019s preparations for the Olympics got off to the worst possible start with surprising losses against Nigeria and Australia in warm-up matches.\n\nBack-to-back victories against Argentina and Spain seemingly put them on the right path, but they looked shaky in the opening game as France ended their 25-game winning streak in Olympic basketball.\n\nWhile they bounced back with comfortable wins over Iran and the Czech Republic, the USA\u2019s problems were far from over.\n\nDuring their quarter-final against Australia, they found themselves down by 15 in the first half before they managed to put a run together and take a 30-point lead.\n\nIt was another slow start against France in the final as they struggled to deal with Rudy Gobert\u2019s size and physicality in defence.\n\nOn offence they were cold, struggling to make open shots, and Gobert\u2019s presence around the basket made it hard for the Americans to score inside.\n\nPopovich\u2019s team eventually took command, but could never really pull away from their opponents as Nando de Colo made it a three-point game with 10 seconds left.\n\nBut the final free throws would fittingly fall to Durant, who made both to put the game beyond France\u2019s reach.\n\nDespite failing to live up to their billing, one player who consistently shone for Team USA was Brooklyn Nets star Durant.\n\nThe 32-year-old led by example throughout the tournament and scored 23 points in their final group game against the Czech Republic to surpass Carmelo Anthony as Team USA\u2019s all-time leading scorer.\n\nIn the knockout phase, Durant averaged 27 points per game in wins over Australia, Spain and France as he claimed a third personal gold medal after being part of triumphs in 2012 and 2016.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou realise, you know, you finished the job, you get the gold medal, you get the trophy, but when you go through that journey, it\u2019s just incredible to be a part of something so special. I\u2019m bonded to these guys for life.\u201d\n\nLauren Holiday, a two-time Olympic gold medallist in women\u2019s football, expressed her pride as husband Jrue added to his NBA title success with Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThere was also high praise for Durant from Stephen A. Smith who described him as \u201cTeam USA\u2019s Captain America\u201d.",

          "text": "Hundreds of fully vaccinated people in England have been hospitalised with the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, scientists said on Friday.\n\nIn its latest COVID-19 update, Public Health England (PHE) also warned there were early signs that people who have been inoculated may be able to transmit the Delta strain as easily as those who have not received any jabs.\n\nFrom July 19 to August 2, 55.1 percent of the 1,467 people hospitalised with the Delta variant were unvaccinated, PHE said, while 34.9 percent \u2013 or 512 people \u2013 had received two doses.\n\nDubbed \u201cfreedom day\u201d, July 19 was the date England significantly eased lockdown restrictions.\n\nAll vaccines in use in the United Kingdom \u2013 those produced by AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech \u2013 require recipients to receive two doses to be fully inoculated.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the UK\u2019s adult population has received two shots to date.\n\n\u201cAs more of the population gets vaccinated, we will see a higher relative percentage of vaccinated people in hospital,\u201d PHE said.\n\nJenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the hospitalisation figures showed \u201conce again how important it is that we all come forward to receive both doses of the vaccine as soon as we are able to do so\u201d.\n\n\u201cVaccination is the best tool we have in keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from the serious disease risk COVID-19 can pose,\u201d Harries said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must also remember that the vaccines do not eliminate all risk: it is still possible to become unwell with COVID-19 and infect others.\u201d\n\nPHE\u2019s findings chime with those from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which last week raised concerns that vaccinated people infected with Delta could, unlike with other variants, readily transmit it.\n\nVaccines have been shown to provide good protection against severe disease and death from Delta, especially with two doses, but there is less data on whether vaccinated people can still transmit it to others.\n\n\u201cSome initial findings \u2026 indicate that levels of virus in those who become infected with Delta having already been vaccinated may be similar to levels found in unvaccinated people,\u201d PHE said.\n\n\u201cThis may have implications for people\u2019s infectiousness, whether they have been vaccinated or not. However, this is early exploratory analysis and further targeted studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case.\u201d\n\nThe Delta variant has become the dominant form of coronavirus circulating globally, sustaining a pandemic that has already killed more than 4.4 million people, including more than 130,000 in the UK.\n\nIt now accounts for 99 percent of all COVID-19 infections in the UK, PHE said.",
