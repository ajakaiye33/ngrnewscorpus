          "title": "SFH to empower over 700 Kano CPs, PPMVs to provide quality healthcare services",
          "text": ",\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nThe Society for Family Health, SFH has disclosed plans by the organization to empower over 700 Community Pharmacists, CPs and Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors, PPMVs in Kano State under a new project tagged, Integrated E, 2.0 to provide improved and quality healthcare services and handle common community health challenges.\n\nA staff of SFH and Project Director, Pharm. Emeka Okafor disclosed this during a stakeholder\u2019s inception meeting to unveil the project in Kano state.\n\nThe four years project Integrated E 2.0 is being implemented by the Society for Family Health, SFH and co-funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and MSD for Mothers Foundation.\n\nDr. Okafor said the training for the cadre of healthcare providers became imperative to empower the persons who largely provide healthcare services to the teeming population noting that 60 per cent of the people in the communities and entire nation seek care from either the Community Pharmacists or PPMVs\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is a proof of concept that Community Pharmacists, CPs and Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors, PPMVs on the cadre of providers that a lot of people called chemist or drug shops have the capacity to provide Family Planning and Primary Healthcare Services than they are authorized by law. And the whole essence is to be able to look inwards the minimum package of services that these providers can be properly trained to provide, properly supervised and also the treatment outcome will be such that it will be reflective of disease burden in the state and the nation as a whole.\n\n\u201cCurrently, about 60 per cent of the people in the community and entire population seek care from either the Community Pharmacists or PPMVs. And for a very long time, government have been focusing on where 40 per cent of the people access care. So it does make sense that govt beams it search light on where 60 per cent access care to improve the quality of services that is being provided. And that is what the project seeks to achieve.\n\n\u201cIn the state, we did a Geo Information System, GIS mapping out the size and services of the Community Pharmacists and Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors, PPMVs in the state. We found out that we have 6,500 PPMVs and 250 Community Pharmacists. What we also discover is the Community Pharmacists are located in Kano metropolis and maybe a few popular towns while PPMVs are more in the rural areas. So it does make sense to begin to look at what quality of services are the PPMVs providing. When you look at the Primary Healthcare Services, what can they (PPMVs) be trained to provide and how can they be properly supervised to make sure that this training is translating to quality services.\n\n\u201cSo in the state, we are looking at training just a fraction of the number, about 10 per cent (650 PPMVs and 50 Community Pharmacists).\n\n\u201cAnd we are doing this in close collaboration with the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria, PCN who are regulators of the practice of Community Pharmacists and Patent and Proprietory Medicine Vendors, PPMVs. We are also working with the state Ministry of Health to make sure we achieve a better outcome,\u201d the Project Director, Dr. Okafor said.\n\nThe Kano State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Ibrahim Tsanyawa described the project as a welcome intervention which will go a long way to help towards addressing community health cases as well as issues relating to its personnel and health facilities usually overwhelmed by patients.\n\nThe Commissioner represented by the Executive Secretary, Private Health Institutions Management Agency, PHIMA, Dr. Usman Tijjani said, \u201cIt is a very good intervention. It will empower the Community Pharmacists, CPs and Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors, PPMVs to be able to manage small ill health issues such as diarrhoea, malaria in our communities or community cases management before referring them to the hospitals. Due to the teeming population, you have in Kano, you go to the hospital, it is a problem for you to see the doctor or no bed and the rest of that. So this intervention is going to improve healthcare service delivery in the state\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Regional Programme Manager, Dayyabu Mahmud said the Integrated E 1.0 of the project was implemented in Lagos and Kaduna with the CPs and PPMVs trained to improve quality services of Family Planning but the Integrated E 2.0 is expanded to provide Family Planning services and also some minimum package of primary healthcare services like malaria, pneumonia, tuberculosis and malnutrition.\n\nMahmud said the project encourages task shifting and task sharing policy revised to include roles for each cadre of PPMVs in accordance with the tiered accreditation system.\n\nMeanwhile, the project is being piloted in about 11 states with Lagos and Kaduna as phase 1, Kano, Nasarawa, Gombe and Enugu in phase 2 while Sokoto, Niger, Bauchi, Borno and Yobe were in phase 3.",

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), on Monday, accused three co-defendants, in the alleged drug trafficking case against suspended DCP Abba Kyari and others, of being unruly while in its custody.\n\nNDLEA lawyer and director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Joseph Sunday, made the allegation before Justice Emeka Nwite of a Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe development came shortly after Justice Nwite fixed March 28 for ruling on the bail application of the defendants, including Kyari.\n\n\n\nSunday, who told Justice Nwite that ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu did not conduct themselves well while in their custody, prayed the court to make an order transferring them to a correctional centre.\n\n\u201cThe 3rd to 5th defendants were very unruly while in our custody,\u201d he said, urging the court to make an order for their transfer.\n\nHe said if they were ready to undertake to be of good conduct, the agency would be ready to admit them back in its custody.\n\nBut counsel for the 3rd defendant (ASP Bawa James), Michael Mbanefo, expressed surprised at Sunday\u2019s remark.\n\n\n\nN. Y. Chiwar, lawyer to Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu (4th and 5th defendants), informed that the allegation was due to the difficult of members of their families having access to them.\n\n\n\nChiwar, who undertook that the defendants would be of good behaviour, prayed the court to allow them to continue to be kept in NDLEA custody.\n\nRuling, the judge held that in view of the undertaking by their counsel to the effect that they would be of good behaviour while in custody, \u201cI am minded to grant the prayer.\u201d\n\nNwite, however, said that if there was any report contrary to the undertaking, he would revoke the order.\n\nEarlier, Mahmud Magaji, SAN, counsel for Kyari and Ubia, told the court that a bail application was filed in respect of his clients.\n\n\n\nMagaji, who said the offences with which Kyari and Ubia are being charged are bailable ones, also said that the constitution gave the court the discretionary power to do so.\n\n\n\nHe urged the judge to grant the bail on liberal terms.\n\nHe based his argument on the presumption of innocence of Kyari and Ubia as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution, until the court decides otherwise.\n\n\n\nThe lawyer argued that the law provides that the defendants be given an opportunity, time and space to prepare for their defence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe presumption of innocence granted to every accused person will be lost if the defendants are denied bail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe defendants have undertaken to be present in court throughout the duration of their trial,\u201d he further argued.\n\n\n\nHowever, counsel to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Joseph Sunday, a director of Prosecution and Legal Services, opposed the bail application.\n\nCorroborating, counsel for the 4th and 5th defendants, Chiwar, argued that \u201cissues of defence involve sober reflection, and the defendants\u2019 prolonged incarceration will deny them that right to ample time and facilities to defend themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also urged the court to admit then to bail.\n\nBut, the lawyer to the 3rd defendant, Mbanefo, could not move his client\u2019s bail application due to late service of NDLEA\u2019s counter-affidavit to his bail request.\n\n\n\nReacting, NDLEA\u2019s lawyer, Sunday, prayed the court to refuse the bail request by Kyari and all the other defendants.\n\n\n\nHe said their reasons for opposing the application were in paragraph 3.5 of their counter affidavit.\n\n\n\nAfter listening to the arguments of all the lawyers in the suit, the judge adjourned the case until March 28 for ruling on the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th defendants\u2019 bail application\n\n\n\nHe, however, fixed March 28 for hearing a bail application by 3rd defendant.\n\n\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that while Kyari is the 1st defendant; ACP Sunday J. Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu are 2nd to 5th defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022.\n\nThe police officers, including Kyari, were four members of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), who pleaded not guilty to the eight-count charge bordering on alleged drug trafficking.\n\nBut Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne are the 6th and 7th defendants respectively, who pleaded guilty to counts five, six and seven preferred against them.\n\nUmeibe and Ezenwanne are the two alleged drug traffickers that were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "N-Power\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA-THE federal government has begun entrepreneurial training of 467,183 out of the 500,000 beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme captured in exited batches A and B.\n\nThe batches were exited last year after over two years to pave way for another set of beneficiaries of the National Social Investment Programme,NSIP of the government.\n\nThe trainees who are from all states of the federation, would be trained on empowerment skills with a view to accessing loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria,CBN, to establish businesses of their own.\n\nThe development was in fulfilment of the promise made by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development,Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq,to establish an exit programme for the N-Power beneficiaries.\n\nUnder the programme, otherwise known as NEXIT Programme,the N-Power beneficiaries are to get loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria, upon training.\n\nSpeaking at the flag-off of the NEXIM CBN Agric Business,Small and Medium Enterprises Scheme,AGSMES scheme in Abuja, Monday,the minister explained that,\u201dThe N-Power programme is key to helping young Nigerians acquire and develop life-long skills that ensure they become solution providers and entrepreneurs in their communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe N-Power programme is a critical part of the National Social Investment Programmes domiciled in the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development (FMHADMSD) and designed to achieve the National objectives of poverty reduction and job creation,\u201dshe added.\n\nExplaining that N-Power has three core segments, namely:\u201dN-Power Volunteer Corps \u2013 the Graduate programme;\n\nN-Power Build \u2013 Non graduate programme and N-Power Knowledge \u2013 Which is a non-graduate programme and embodies the N-Tech Hardware, N-Tech Software and the N-Creative training programme\u201d,she said:\u201dRecently, more segments have been embedded into the N-Power programme such as the N-Skills which is for youth with no formal education who would be trained in different vocational skills and trades.\u201d\n\nA\u00e7cording to her,\u201dThe Mobile Money Agents which are for financial inclusion of this youth segment is another great feat.\u201d\n\n\u201d It has been my desire that the exited batches A and B N-Power graduate beneficiaries would not be left unattended to. In different channels, I kept on assuring these teaming youths that the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development has worked very closely with the Central Bank of Nigeria to realize this dream.\n\n\u201cToday marks the beginning of the fulfilment of this awaited training that will enable those beneficiaries that indicated interest to participate in the CBN empowerment programme,\u201dshe said.\n\nFarouq expressed gratitude for the support received \u201cfrom CBN towards the development of NEXIT Portal which was used by the Ministry to collate the data of the exited N-Power batches A and B beneficiaries. \u201c\n\n\u201cThis has been a painstaking exercise to ensure that eligible and interested beneficiaries are not left out of this laudable programme. This is quite commendable as the exercise was totally free of any political interference. At the end of it all, shortlisted beneficiaries would have a sense of fulfillment and would be satisfied of this support\u201d,she said.\n\nA\u00e7cording to her,\u201dFrom available records, 467,183 applicants were submitted for the confirmation process in February this year. From the records, we identified 182,976 female and 284,191 males while 16 did not specify. 263,998 of these applicants have confirmed their availability to participate in the training programme.\u201d\n\nShe spoke further: \u201cFor ease of coordination, this training programme would be conducted in phases. Let me also inform you that all the 36 States and FCT are participating in this long awaited NEXIT training programme.\n\n\u201cA total of 75,600 participants are in this first batch of the training. We will continue to train the remaining batches in no distant time.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development is committed to ensuring that the strategic objectives of all the social intervention programs are harnessed to achieve the desired goals and objectives.\u201d",

          "title": "Family of 14-year-old student files N10 billion suit against Premier Academy, 7 others for negligence",
          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe family of Miss Keren-Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher, the late 14-year-old Senior Secondary School I (SS I) student of Premier Academy in Abuja, has slammed a N10 billion lawsuit against the school over alleged negligence resulting in her rape and eventual death.\n\nListed as defendants in the suit by her grieving mother, Mrs Vivien Vihimga Akpagher, are the former Managing Director of Skye Bank and Mr Akinsola Akifemiwa who are owners of the school located in Lugbe, Abuja.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nOthers are Dr Omotayo Akinfemiwa, Chief MK Osuma, AAGMR Ltd (represented by Akinsola Akinfemiwa), Premiere Eye Center Ltd ( represented by Akinsola Akinfemiwa), Mr Christopher Akinsowon, Mrs Grace Salami and Nurse Lois Bung as 1st to 8th Defendants.\n\nKeren-Happuch died on June 22, 2021, after developing sepsis as a result of the infection caused by the condom left inside her by her rapist, which compromised her immunity, spiked her blood sugar resulting in hyperglycaemia.\n\nThe mother of the late boarding student had alleged that her daughter died of an infection after a condom was found in her private part.\n\nShe further alleged that the girl had been sexually abused in the school before being taken to the hospital on June 19 for treatment.\n\nThe student, however, died two days later in the hospital located in the Wuse 2 area of Abuja.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nHowever, the school authorities, in a statement, claimed that the student left the school in a healthy condition, as opposed to the mother\u2019s claim.\n\nThe deceased mother is insisting that the footage of the Closed Circuit Television(CCTV) of June 16th and 17th, showing the state of her daughter must be recovered by the police.\n\nIn a suit filed before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory(FCT), Abuja, the bereaved mother is seeking an order restraining the defendants by themselves, their agents and privies from threatening the Plaintiff and her allies in respect of this suit, during and after the trial.\n\nPlaintiff is praying the court for the following reliefs: \u201cA declaration that the negligence of the Defendants caused the Plaintiff\u2019s daughter\u2019s Keren \u2013Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher death on the 22nd day of June 2021.\n\n\u201cA declaration that the acts of the defendants, who owed the Duty of Care to Plaintiff\u2019s daughter, were negligent and this led to her death as a result of rape, sexual abuse and molestation which happened under their care.\u201d\n\nShe further urged the court to declare that the acts of the defendants who instructed the 8th defendant to administer dexamethasone (a steroid) on Keren \u2013Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher exacerbated her underlining illness: \u201cdiabetes\u201d and this led to her death.\n\n\u201cA declaration that the defendants\u2019 failure to apprehend the perpetrator or allow the due process of the law to be carried out on time in other to fish out the perpetrator who is within their vicinity have intentionally inflicted the plaintiff with emotional distress, mental distress and nervous breakdown.\n\nShould the court grant her reliefs, she is pressing for the award of N10 billion as damages against the defendants for the breach of duty of care and negligence which led to the death of Keren\u2013Happuch Aondodoo Akpagher.\u201d\n\nAnother N20 million for emotional, mental, psychological and physical stress on the plaintiff, caused by the painful death of her daughter at the hands of the defendants who owed her duty of care and cost of Litigation.\n\nIn support of the reliefs sought by the plaintiff are a -61 paragraph statement of claims, wherein Mrs Akpagher painted a graphic picture of how she got a tip-off from Keren\u2019s Housemother, Mrs Rita Abejide to resist attempts by the matron not to allow her to take her daughter away from the school, disclosing that the child was distraught and unable to walk on the 16th of June 2021 as she was in pain and had to be assisted to go to class.\n\nShe said despite her demand that the police retrieve CCTV footage of the 15th and 16th of June 2021, which she knows discloses how her daughter was sexually abused and the identity of her abuser, the defendants have chosen to obstruct justice by concealing the said footage.\n\nShe explained how Keren eventually became critically ill the following day after returning home and she was rushed to the hospital on Monday, 21st of June 2021 in a bad state and that was when it was discovered by the medical team at Queen\u2019s Clinic that her daughter had been sexually abused.\n\nThe plaintiff will rely on the test results, and the hospital reports and records of Queens Clinic, Wuse Abuja, which prove that a condom was left inside of her late daughter and her urine contained dead spermatozoa.\n\nThe plaintiff states that \u201cfollowing the test results, she called the school management that is the 6th and 7th defendants at about 1 pm on the 21/06/21 to come to the hospital but never disclosed the findings. But before the management came, the plaintiff called a teacher in the 1st defendant, Mr Chukwuka Okafor, whom she had never told what the hospital revealed and during their discussion, he prayed her daughter gets better and come back to school to which the plaintiff said she won\u2019t be coming back and he said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry madam we will get to the bottom of it so that it does not happen to another child.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff states that her daughter died early hours of Tuesday 22/6/2021 from hyperglycemia triggered by sepsis resulting from the infection caused by the condom, which was left inside her and aided by the dexamethasone that was administered to her in the school clinic by her nurse Lois Bung which compromised her immunity. The plaintiff will rely on all the medical documents given to her by Queens Clinic Abuja in the course of trial.\n\nThe plaintiff states Lois Bung wrote a statement at the police stating that she had given Keren-Happuch 5 tablets of Dexamethasone (steroid) and 1 tablet of Loratadine (anti-allergy). These drugs given to her were not part of her routine drugs, and the defendants were negligent in not seeking her consent before administering such drugs to her daughter and never also deemed it fit to inform her that such drugs were administered to enable her to take precaution and also inform the family doctor.\n\n\u201cWe give the FCT Police Command Gender Department in charge of this matter the notice to produce the Statement of Lois Bung admitting that she administered the said drug to Keren-Happuch Akpagher.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the defendants ordered that dexamethasone be given to her daughter for sinister reasons because her daughter complaining of redness of the eye didn\u2019t warrant such strong steroids like dexamethasone. The defendants knew that such medication would increase her daughter\u2019s blood sugar levels and weaken her immunity which could lead to hyperglycemia. The defendants never gave her the medical records of her daughter even till date.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the condom and dead spermatozoa found in her daughter has no other indication except, rape, sexual molestation and sexual abuse of her daughter. This in combination with the high sugar and sepsis which led to her daughter\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the failure of the defendants to seek consent from her who knows her daughter very well points to lack of respect and understanding of the child\u2019s rights and of her\u2019s as her mother.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that she also handed over a transcription as well as a voice recording of her conversation with the Matron, Mrs Grace Salami and the Head of Pastoral, Mr Olusegun Adesanmi when they visited the hospital on the 21st June 2021.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the Command has not at any time intimated them of the progress of the investigation. The FCT Police command denied them of copies of the medical and autopsy reports but has released the same to the school which they stated in some of their interviews in some newspapers including Eagleonline Publication of 13/09/21 and Punch Newspapers of 14/09/21. The plaintiff will rely on the said publication in the course of trial.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the acting principal of the school the 6th defendant stated in Thisday Newspaper of 9th of August 2021 that \u2018if we had known there was a condom inside her, we would have removed it.\u2019 The plaintiff showed this piece of publication to the police, but they failed to act on it.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the FCT Command called her to the station to ask if the report they got from the school that my son told his friend who told his father I wasn\u2019t taking good care of them was true. The police at the FCT Command also summoned the plaintiff to tell her that the school had asked them to get her daughter\u2019s jotter, phone and bible from her because they think she might have written something in it \u2013 which she refused to submit.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that because of the circumstances ad clinical evidence surrounding her daughter\u2019s death she is convinced that all the defendants were aware, connived, concealed, aided in putting her daughter in the hands of men who sexually molest children on the premises of the 1st defendant.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that her daughter has been in the 1st Defendant\u2019s (the school) for over 3 years and has religiously been taking her injections without any problem. She has never been admitted in the hospital for one day and it is obvious it\u2019s because of what the clinical test revealed and found in her as a result of sexual abuse and rape which happened under the supervision and care of the Defendants that led to her death.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the dead spermatozoa found in her daughter\u2019s urine and the foreign body which she believes to be condom was inside her daughter prior to the 19th day of June 2021 when she picked her up from school. The plaintiff concludes that her daughter was going through trauma before and after she picked her up from the school on the 19th day of June 2021.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the dead spermatozoa belong to a male who lives and/or works in the premises of the 1st to the 6th defendants. The dead spermatozoa means that her daughter was raped and sexually abused prior to her coming home on the 19th of June 2021. The plaintiff will prove this in the course of trial through the witness of expert medical doctors.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that at her sober moment she recalls the events that transpired within the four days her daughter fell sick that led to her death, why her daughter cried and begged to be taken home, was extremely sad the day the matron refused her leaving with her, and now understand why the school authorities prevented her from accessing her daughter earlier than when she finally did was all to cover up the trauma her daughter was going through in the hands of her abusers and molesters in the 1st defendant premises.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that she has raised alarm on all quarters concerning the grave danger children are going through at the 1st defendant and some Civil Society Organisations have joined her to call for a thorough investigation into the activities of the school that led to her daughter\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that within the past months after her daughter\u2019s death some parents and students reached out to her confessing that some of their children were also sexually molested, abused and sodomized by male teachers of the 1st defendant. We will rely on the voice notes of one of the former students of Premiere Academy testifying to how she was sexually abused as a 13-year-old in the school and declaring that there were a number of men who molest children in the school. This voice note was given to the police, but they failed to act on it.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that a letter of indefinite suspension issued to a former PHE teacher Mr Onitilo KK for sexually molesting a student who was never handed over to the police but released into society by the defendants will be relied on in the course of trial.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the defendants owed her daughter the duty of care and protection of which they failed woefully which eventually caused the death of her daughter. The defendants were negligent and breached that duty by failing to meet their obligations, which has put her daughter in harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that her daughter was only 14 years old, a child, a minor whose care and protection was solely the responsibilities of the defendants because she was in the boarding facilities of the Defendants where she was raped, molested on several occasions which led to her death.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the person who molested, abused, raped and killed her daughter is well known to the defendants but they have decided to shield the person for reasons best known to them and for reasons they are all benefiting from.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that she has asked the police to request from the defendants the CCTV footage of 15th and 16th June 2021 because she knows the said footage will reveal the identity of those who raped her daughter. The defendants have a huge secret to hide and that is why they refused to release the said footage.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the 7th defendant admitted that her daughter never came for her tests/injections on the 16th day of June 2021, the same day she was reported as not being able to walk to school without assistance for her test.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that if the defendants were not benefitting from it they have no reason not to fish out the perpetrator and punish accordingly. They have obstructed the investigation, connived with the law enforcement authorities to cover up the case.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the defendants are using the police to harass and intimidate her and the civil society coalition spokesperson Lemmy Ugegbe who has been on the front burner of this tragedy to make the police and the defendants do the right thing by taking responsibility and bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff states that the school has written a petition against Mr Lemmy Ughegbe and herself to the Inspector- General of Police citing Defamation and Provocation of Premiere Academy the defendants. They have been invited by the police on several occasions to intimidate them from putting media pressure to make the defendants do the right thing. On the 16th day of February 2022, the police invited Mr Lemmy Ughebe again on the account of the defendants in other to shut him up, pressing trumped up charges against him and the whole idea is to let back down in supporting justice of this case.\u201d",

          "title": "APC Moves to Retain Buni as Interim Chairman, Bello as Acting Chair",
          "text": "\n\n*John Akpanudoedehe\u2019s fate uncertain\n\n*Group alleges fresh plot to sack Yobe gov through court injunction\n\n*Party moves to have court injunction stopping convention vacated\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have agreed to keep Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as Interim Chairman of the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), while Niger State Governor Sani Bello functions as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity while Buni remains away.\n\n\n\nBuni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as the CECPC chairman. It was gathered yesterday that the party is maintaining the letter of transition remains in force even as Buni remains interim caretaker chairman. .\n\n\n\nHowever, it is not clear what they would ultimately do with Buni, as there is a move by some party stakeholders to have him impeached. Also, the fate of the CECPC Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe remains uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out.\n\n\n\nJust last weekend, as part of intense lobby going on in the ruling party, former leaders of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) stormed London, where President Muhammadu Buhari is currently undergoing routine medical check-up, to persuade him to give more room to members of CPC,, one of the legacy parties that merged to form the APC before the 2015 general election, claiming they have been thoroughly marginalised in the scheme of things.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, according to observers \u201ccentral London Mosque, was overtaken by Nigerians, including ministers, governors, and many high net worth people, during Friday jumat prayers. As politicians have flown to London to lobby the President ahead of 2023 elections..\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Buni officially remains the interim CECPC chair as he was never legally removed in the first place, and since he transmitted a letter to Bello to act in his absence, that automatically confers his powers on Bello. And Bello would continue in his acting role which by implication means he would be carrying out the day to day running of the party. Meanwhile some of Buni\u2019s supporters believe he may return to the country this week while others want him to remain abroad until after the convention.\n\n\n\nThe Party\u2019s National Convention slated for March 26, THISDAY learnt will hold as planned.\n\nReliable sources in the presidency disclosed these yesterday, stressing that only a properly constituted National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can remove the Buni-led CECPC.\n\n\n\nBello had announced a few days ago that he had taken over affairs at the APC national headquarters, disclosing that he was acting as Chairman in the absence of Buni.\n\n\n\nHe has called a NEC a meeting which INEC said was out of order because the letter was not signed by Chairman Buni and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn the turn of event the President\u2019s Legal Adviser may have appealed to him to allow Buni remain as interim chair while Bello continues as acting chairman.\n\n\n\nAccording to one of the sources, some of the president\u2019s associates noted that by the framework of the Party\u2019s NEC, Buni was never removed as CECPC chairman. \u201cYou cannot even be talking of return, when he was never removed, in the first place,\u201d a presidency source said.\n\n\n\nThe alleged removal of Buni had unsettled the party, causing division among APC governors and top stakeholders, with some alleging that the Yobe State governor was plotting to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\n\nWhile some expressed satisfaction with the development, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of the party\u2019s NEC, where Bello\u2019s chairmanship was to be ratified.\n\n\n\nWhat has become apparent is that majority of the governors, in their bid to oust Buni by all means, failed to reckon with INEC. They thought they had succeeded, well, almost, and they had started to celebrate victory, until INEC threw a spanner in the works.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position, among other issues, led some from Buhari\u2019s inner circle of advisers to meet with him at the weekend.\n\n\n\nShedding light on the outcome of the meeting with the president, a source pointed out that Buhari informed those in attendance that his desire was to see that the convention was held as planned. Buhari also wanted to see a smooth, democratic and popular contest that would lead to the birth of a brand new National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, the source said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe president was persuaded that there was a process that needed to be followed to remove the Buni-led CECPC. The NEC of the party is the highest administrative organ of the party, which takes very important decisions in terms of removal and appointment of the party leadership. Buni was not appointed by an imperial authority with the power remove him.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the decision to appoint him was taken by NEC, it is only NEC that can remove him. So, Buni was never removed, in the first place. Certainly, if he personally withdraws, resigns or a NEC meeting takes place to remove him, then we can be talking about having a new CECPC chairman.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of that has taken place; so the idea of removal does not arise. However, the party may come up with an arrangement to allow for certain processes to take place, particularly relating to conventions.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Buni may decide to take the back seat to allow the convention process to take place, if he does that, then fine. However, the idea of concluding that he has been removed does not arise.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuni was blamed for withholding information from Party leaders about a court injunction stopping the party from going ahead with the convention. The Party has since set machinery in motion to have the injunction vacated this week to enable the convention hold.\n\n\n\nA faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate so. Apparently miffed by the what he was told, the president was said to have immediately directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\n\n\nAnother source at the meeting explained that Buhari was convinced of the need to allow Buni to to continue as interim chairman which the president was said to have accepted to save the party from danger.\n\n\n\nThe source also revealed that another contentious issue that was discussed was the president\u2019s purported endorsement of former Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Adamu, for the position of APC National Chairman. There have been intense lobby for the President to drop Adamu and allow for a contested convention. Most of the other aspirants have kicked against the President\u2019s purported endorsement of Abdulahi Adamu. The lobby to drop Adamu was said to have intensified at the weekend as some governors are preparing to jet to London to mount pressure on Buhari to change his mind on Adamu.\n\n\n\nBuhari had assured party members before departing the country for his medical trip, that he would do everything to ensure the convention holds as scheduled on March 26.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress Youth Development and Solidarity Network (APC-YDSN) has alleged fresh plot by some APC Governors to get a court injunction to effectively sack Buni as CECPC Chairman.\n\nThe Secretary General, Mr. Tobias Ogbeh, made this allegation while addressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe group said after the failed leadership change in the party, there had been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\n\nThe group stated: \u201cAs we may be aware, some governors within the party have attempted to change the leadership of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs despicable as this might sound, there has been an attempt at effecting a change in the leadership of the party, not on the strength of the interest of the party, but in furtherance of a blind ambition towards taking over the party structure through the back door in the buildup to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that we have it on good authority that since the humiliation suffered by the sponsors of the failed leadership change in the party, there have been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe group warned judges and other officers in the legal profession to refuse to be used as pawns to truncate the democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThe group informed all APC stakeholders and members of the general public that part of the new plot was to secure a court judgement through the back door that would sack the party\u2019s leadership from office.\n\n\n\nThe scheme, the group alleged, was heavily funded by a serving minister and presidential aspirant from the south.\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the general public to be on the watch as the manifestation of this plot would gather steam soonest.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Gencos: Nation in Darkness Because We are Owed N1.6trn Since 2013",
          "text": "*NBET disputes power generators\u2019 debt claim\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nPower Generation Companies (Gencos) under the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC) yesterday stated that the power supply situation in the country was worsening because they were owed over N1.6 trillion since 2013.\n\n\n\nAPGC\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Joy Ogaji, in a briefing in Abuja, argued that a situation where the energy dispatched by the power generators was used as an index for power generation capacity was detrimental to their survival.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, the already bad power supply situation in the country had worsened as players in the sector continued to trade blames as to whose table the buck stops.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are currently owed N1.644 trillion. One of the reasons that the power plants are down is due to inefficient management of the grid,\u201d Ogaji said.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, the Gencos have exhausted all their borrowing sources, as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had reportedly warned the banks to desist from lending money to them.\n\nShe stated, \u201cIf you give us gas, provide forex to carry out maintenance. I have told you most of the units are down and they need money to fix them.\n\n\n\n\u201cGive us enough money to pay our gas suppliers because it is pre-payment. But for power, it is take and pay later. There is no way that this misalignment will help us.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Ogaji stated admitted that at the moment, the Gencos were generating an average of 4,000MW.\n\nHowever, the debt claim by the Gencos was immediately refuted by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET). NBET disputed the figures quoted by the power generators, saying only companies with active gas supply and transportation contracts are paid for unutilised capacity.\n\n\n\nThe Head, Corporate Communication, NBET, Henrietta Ighomrore, explained that in the country, only five power generation companies with active Gas Purchase Agreement (GPA) were entitled to be paid for unused capacity.\n\nAccording to her, claims that the Gencos have the capacity to generate 9,000MW are not accurate, as inspections by NBET had shown that the so-called capacity does not exist.\n\n\n\nEarlier, Ighomrore argued that the Gencos had always been paid as and when due, explaining that in the last payment cycle alone, the Gencos were paid N38 billion for electricity distributed on the grid.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, NBET has paid the Gencos over 90 per cent of their invoices. She noted that the company paid the generators almost immediately remittances from the Discos were received.\n\nHowever, Ogaji noted that the illiquidity caused by the huge sums owed the Gencos by NBET had continued to frustrate them and render them incapable of meeting their obligations.\n\n\n\nSuch obligations, she said, included Operations and Maintenance (O&M) as and when due, procurement of critical capital, spare parts and accessories, payment, and servicing of existing loans from lenders and financiers and employee- obligations.\n\n\n\nOgaji listed foreign exchange as another challenge faced by the hydroelectric power plants, whose concession fees, she maintained were \u201cdollarised.\u201d\n\nShe said most of the electricity generated in Nigeria came from gas-fired turbines, explaining that Gencos have consistently been dealing with unending gas-related challenges, which inhibit optimal generation.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, issues of gas volume, gas quality, gas pressure and gas transportation have consistently curtailed capacity utilisation by Gencos thereby affecting generation.\n\nOgaji stated, \u201cUnfortunately, the unenforceable state of the contracts in the NESI and the broken cycle of payment assurance has made the enforcement of what would ordinarily be basic obligations of parties to the industry agreements, impossible.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince 2013 when the power sector was partially privatised till date, weak and inadequate infrastructure (transmission and distribution) have continued to render inconsequential, a significant portion of the generation capacities recovered or added by Gencos through huge investments done by them to increase their respective generation capacities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to her, while the owners of the Gencos invested and increased generation capacity up to 13,000MW across the country, no corresponding investment and improvement was made at the transmission and distribution ends. The result, she said, was the significant stranded capacity of Gencos.\n\n\n\nOgaji added, \u201cThe persistence of this anomaly over these years, compelled Gencos to begin to question the commercial reasonability of continued investment in recovery or expansion of generation capacity that would end up being stranded and not utilised to transmit and distribute electricity to end users who are yearning for same.\u201d\n\nShe said the foundational agreements, which Gencos were told existed before, no longer exists, after they had commenced performance, with dire implication for power generators.\n\n\n\nOgaji stated, \u201cWe should address the root cause and not the symptoms, for sustainability of the NESI and the power sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current state of the national grid must be addressed, otherwise we will continue to always deny Nigerians their legitimate expectation of unhindered rights to reliable supply of electricity.\u201d\n\n\n\nChecks by THISDAY revealed that all the parties\u2019 positions were not entirely accurate. Firstly, it is wrong to claim that only five generation companies have gas supply agreement, meaning that there is no level playing field. Further checks revealed that the Gencos were being owed not only capacity charges but also for interest and energy charges as well \u2013 value which is yet to be determined. And also the forex issue is not restricted to hydros alone, but it affects gas fire and thermal plants as well.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is equally carrying out maintenance work on their lines. Furthermore, a lot of the gas companies were also doing maintenance work on their infrastructure, limiting supply of gas to generation companies. All these put together made power supply epileptic in the country\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Wants religion to be used for unity, improvement of people\u2019s lives\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, declared at the weekend that in the last seven years of working with President Muhammadu Buhari, there has not been any religious dispute between them.\n\n\n\nOsinbajo called on religious leaders to use faith to unite the country and improve the lives of the citizens.\n\nThe vice president spoke while playing host to the Senegal-based Grand Khalifa of Tijjaniya Movement Worldwide, His Eminence, Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Niass, at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\n\nOsinbajo described Buhari as a leader who accommodated people of different religious backgrounds, citing his relationship with the president spanning over seven years as a perfect example.\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, \u201cPresident Buhari is a serious Muslim and I am a pastor, both of us have worked together for about seven years, we have not had any issues.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president has shown great leadership, he has shown that he wants a country where people of different faiths live in harmony and with love for one another.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe vice president also stressed that beyond the spiritual upliftment of individuals and communities, religious leaders should use faith to promote peace, prosperity, and development of society\n\nOsinbajo, who emphasised the importance of religion in human development, said, \u201cWe must use our faiths to promote peace and prosperity for our people. We need to work together to ensure that our people benefit from religion.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe tend to underestimate the importance of religion, despite the fact that it plays a key role in the development of the society, not just in the spiritual aspect, but also physical.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many nations of the world that have benefitted from the impact of religion, both spiritually and physically. So, we must use religion in our countries (in Africa) to help our people to live better lives because in other parts of the world, leaders of faith have used religion to better the lives of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking further on the need for leaders of faith to close ranks for the purpose of using religion to address emerging challenges in the society, the vice president noted, \u201cNo matter what the situation may be, we in Africa must be able to sit together and talk. We must never allow situations where we cannot sit together.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith what is going on across the world, people of faith must continue to emphasise that both major religions (Islam and Christianity) promote peace and we must allow our people to practise whatever religion they want to practise.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo praised the leader of the group, while commending the Tijjaniya Movement for its progressive ideals and compassion for the needs of the people.\n\n\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Sheikh Niass, who spoke in French with interpretation by a spokesman, thanked the vice president for the opportunity to meet with him. He described the vice president as a great personality, the type needed both in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n\n\nSheikh Niass stated, \u201cThe vice president is a great personality with an exceptional character, standing on two feet: one as a political leader concerned about the progress of his people and the second, as a man of God.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrica needs a person of your nature with very strong background in religion and politics. I pray that the Almighty Allah will upgrade you and enable you achieve your desires and aspirations because, like I said, not only Nigeria but Africa will benefit from your leadership qualities.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that Nigeria \u201cis the heart of Africa and whatever Nigeria becomes, Africa becomes.\u201d\n\nThe Tijjaniya leader also expressed the group\u2019s gratitude to Buhari for his support, while praying for his safety and that Nigeria would overcome all its challenges.\n\nOsinbajo promised to convey the Sheik\u2019s warm greetings and appreciations to the president. He also prayed for peace in Nigeria, Africa, and the world.\n\n\n\nThe Grand Khalifa of Tijjaniya worldwide and other members of the movement from across Africa had converged on Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, to celebrate the 36th International Maulid Anniversary in honour of the movement\u2019s late leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Niass.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Says national convention still holds March 26\n\n*Bello, el-Rufai, Fayemi meet president in London\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appraised recent developments in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and warned the leaders and members of the party to desist forthwith from name-calling and backstabbing.\n\nRather, he said, the party must be ready to put its house in order ahead of the planned national convention of the party holding in Abuja on March 26, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe embattled Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\n\n\nAs Buni is being expected back to take over, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State governor, Mr. Abubakar Sani Bello; Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nThis is as the ruling party has clarified that the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nAs the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party await the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders of the party, they have also mounted pressure on Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the scheduled meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, tasked the leaders and membership of the APC to stop mudslinging ahead of the forthcoming national convention that will lead to the election of new national leaders to run the party for the next four years.\n\nHe also urged them to remain steadfast and maintain their unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\n\n\n\nThe president asked the APC members to look at the once-powerful, \u201cmain opposition\u201d Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\nHe warned that \u201dthey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari recalled that the APC started with a confidence of victory, adding that the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\n\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\n\nThis alone, in addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party, the president further noted, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari also stressed that for more than a week, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinise their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They incline only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nBello, el-Rufai, Fayemi Meet Buhari in London\n\nMeanwhile, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State Governor, Bello; Kaduna State Governor, el-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nA source in the ruling party said the visit was informed by \u201cthe urgent need to brief the president on events since the new Acting Chairman took over as well as bring him up to speed with the preparations for the March 17 NEC meeting and the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe team is also in London to check up on the President as he takes his deserved rest,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe source added that the governors\u2019 visit will put a final seal on all of APC\u2019s plans for the National Convention, especially its NEC meeting believed to be a major determinant of what would happen at the March 26 convention.\n\nBuni to Return This Week as Party Denies Sacking Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn a related development, Buni is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of Buni\u2019s aides informed THISDAY yesterday that as soon as the Yobe State governor returns to the country, he would take charge of the affairs of the party.\n\n\n\nThe aide, who pleaded anonymity, also stated that the acting Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Niger State, Bello is expected to vacate the seat for Buni to avoid dragging the party into any illegality.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe (Buni) is expected back on Monday and of course, with the position of INEC which made his position very clear and if you have read the dailies today, even the secretariat has backtracked and confirmed that he\u2019s still in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as he\u2019s back, obviously, the next thing is to take charge. I am sure the party or the acting chairman now will not want to drag the party into any unconstitutionality or any illegality.\u201d\n\nAlso, Buni\u2019s Director-General for Media and Publicity, Mr Mamman Mohmamed said the acting chairman had stated in unambiguous terms that he was in an acting capacity.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that whenever the substantive chairman comes back, the acting chairman would have to give way.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis is what we expect and this position is very clear by the regulatory body of political parties, which is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC as an institution has said that as far as it is concerned, Governor Buni remains the chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure nobody will want to act in another illegality. So, he is coming back and I am sure the acting chairman will vacate his seat for the substantive chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if Buni will go ahead with the NEC meeting slated for Thursday, Mohammed said it would be part of the issues that would be considered when Buni is back.\n\nThe ruling party has also clarified that Akpanudoedehe did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nThere was confusion at the national secretariat of the party last Tuesday over the fate of Akpanudoedehe.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he had insisted that he was still the secretary except the President said otherwise.\n\nHowever, the APC Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu Dambatta in a statement issued yesterday said the National Secretary never sent any resignation letter.\n\n\n\nDambatta stated: \u201cFurther to the media conference earlier held by the Spokesman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, the party wishes to note that the Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, never sent a resignation letter to the party to the best of its knowledge and neither was he sacked as some social media blogs speculated. All those are utterly false.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe APC is one family, the Caretaker is one unit. We have an Acting Chairman who is racing against time to deliver a convention and committee members that are united in supporting him in carrying out that onerous mandate,\u201d Dambatta explained.\n\n\n\nHe called on the public to disregard social media stories that are not rooted in fact or even sound reasoning.\n\nTHISDAY checks however revealed that the twist in APC\u2019s narration may not be unconnected with the firm stand of the INEC not to recognise the Niger State Governor, Bello as the acting Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBello, who assumed the leadership of the party last Monday had written the electoral body notifying the commission of the party\u2019s decision to convene for an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.\n\nThe ruling party had scheduled its NEC meeting for Thursday, March 17, 2022, where it is believed that the leadership quagmire would be resolved.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that Bello, upon resumption as acting Caretaker Chairman transmitted a letter dated March 8, 2022, informing INEC of the change of guard at the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\n\n\nHowever, INEC in a letter signed by the Secretary to the commission, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony and dated March 9, 2022, said the party must give it 21 days\u2019 notice and that the letter was not signed by the party\u2019s Chairman and Secretary.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that INEC\u2019s response forced the party\u2019s stakeholders to bring Buni back to ensure that the emergency NEC meeting and the national convention of the party are held as scheduled.\n\nIn a related development, the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party are said to be waiting for the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders as part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the leadership crisis in the party.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami was in London, while Buni also flew to London from Dubai to be part of the meeting.\n\n\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cMalami is in London. His mission is two-fold: one, to let Buhari know of the outcome of the Senate rejection of the amendment of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act; two, to report on issues going on in the party. Buni was also in London but is expected back today or tomorrow\u201d\n\nInvestigations showed that the NEC meeting of APC will go on as INEC has no power over the internal control of the parties.\n\n\n\nAnother party source told THISDAY that the Secretary, Senator Akpanudoedehe and the acting Caretaker Chairman and the Governor of Niger State, Bello met with one of the founding fathers of the party on Friday in Abuja.\n\nAt the meeting, it was gathered that the party chieftain urged Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the NEC meeting.\n\n\n\nThe source said some APC governors are also talking to the secretary to see the need to sign the notice and save the party from destruction.\n\nThe source noted that all efforts are to ensure that the convention date of the party is not postponed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is anxiety among members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the national caucus of the main opposition party and the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meet on Monday (tomorrow) and Tuesday to take a decision on the presidential ticket of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nIn a memo to its national caucus, the main opposition party has directed members of the caucus to consider whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe party also urged its national caucus to determine the implications of throwing the presidential ticket open.\n\nWith the election of its National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu from the North, it was expected that the party\u2019s presidential candidate would emerge from the South.\n\n\n\nBut the main opposition party has been playing hide-and-seek games with the issue of where its presidential candidate would come from, raising concerns that it might throw the ticket open, against the popular agitation for power to shift to the South.\n\n\n\nUnlike the PDP, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has set the necessary machinery in motion to choose its presidential candidate from the South.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the two organs of the PDP will decide whether to zone or throw open the presidential ticket of the party for the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nPDP NEC will also decide on the recommendation of the 2019 Elections Review Committee set up by the party to assess its performance in the last general election.\n\n\n\nThe committee headed by the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed had in its recommendation submitted to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party on May 21, 2021, urged the party to allow interested party members to vie for the 2023 presidency, irrespective of their geopolitical zones.\n\n\n\nThe committee had anchored its position on the fact that across the land, Nigeria boasts of good hands capable of bailing the country \u201cout of her current quagmire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report of the committee had stated that: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North-east and South-east geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency, should be given special consideration, in choosing the presidential flagbearer of the party, for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. Moreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader, with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian, from every part of the country, should be allowed to choose the best candidate, through a credible primary election; as a way of institutionalising a merit-based leadership recruitment process, for the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nReceiving the report, the former leader of the party under Prince Uche Secondus had pledged that the NEC would set up a technical committee to review the report, but it never did.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the report of the Bauchi State governor\u2019s committee would form the main agenda of the national caucus meeting and NEC meetings of the PDP.\n\n\n\nA source within the party\u2019s NWC told THISDAY at the weekend that: \u201cThese two organs of the party will look at the report of Governor Bala Mohammed\u2019s committee and in their wisdom decide to either throw the presidential ticket open or zone it to one of the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the memo to the national caucus, there are variables we want them to consider. One is whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election come 2023 and two, what will it cost the PDP if it throws the presidential ticket open.\n\n\n\n\u201cThree, as a party in opposition whether zoning in the PDP is in the overall interest of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that after the National Caucus and NEC meetings, the party\u2019s NWC will still take the issue to the Board of Trustees (BoT) and the PDP governors as well as the National Assembly caucus before a final decision would be reached.\n\nAppointment of Mobilisation Director Divides PDP Govs\n\nMeanwhile, the governors of the PDP are already divided over the appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation for the party.\n\nThe Department of Mobilisation and Organisation of the party is the engine room of the PDP in terms of the election of all delegates, both ad-hoc and statutory delegates, as well as election management.\n\n\n\nThe department is under the control and supervision of the National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, who is a nominee of the Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, who is a presidential aspirant.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a governor from one of the South-south states is the arrowhead of those who want the substantive director replaced with a new director from either Delta State or Imo or Kogi State, so as not to give any presidential aspirant undue advantage.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was learnt that some other governors of the party and the incumbent National Organising Secretary, Umar have rejected the names of those recommended for appointment for the position of new Director of Mobilisation and Organisation.\n\n\n\nThe National Organising Secretary who is a member of the National Working Committee has argued that he was not aware of the said appointment until the nominees were invited for interview.\n\n\n\nAn internal memo sighted by THISDAY, which was signed by the National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, listed those invited for the interview to include: Stephen Onuh from Kogi State; Dr Okey Mbionwu from Imo State and Mr Chukwuma Chinoye from Delta State.\n\n\n\nHowever, the National Organising Secretary is insisting as the head of organisation in the party that there is no need for a change of baton in the mobilisation because the primary elections are already very close.\n\nFollowing the disagreement, the PDP has suspended the planned appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Remember what he said while granting an interview to national television,\u201d the source was quoted as saying.\n\n\n\nThough Osinbajo has yet to openly declare his intention to run for President in 2023, many support groups and individuals, believed to be sponsored, have been rooting for him.\n\n\n\nSome of them have been campaigning for Osinbajo, urging him to contest.",

We are talking about having a presidential candidate. It is a decision of the party. It has to be a collective decision,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody will get the presidential ticket because he spoke good English on the television. Nobody will get the presidential ticket because he was abusing people on television. It is a decision of the party and many factors will be responsible \u2014 covert and overt factors \u2014 because at the end of the day, the ticket will be given to a name that can win the election.

          "title": "Enter Nyesom Wike \u2014 Obaseki\u2019s new godfather",
          "text": "This article uncannily predicted the current dogfight between Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state, and Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo state. It was written and published on September 20, 2020.\n\nAlliances can make and mar us. Jehoshaphat king of Judah (south of Israel) was a man who sought the face of God. He was a decent ruler. But his yoking with kings of base virtue ruined his legacy. In particular, his dalliance with the house of Ahab and Jezebel impaired his bloodline and nearly cost him the glory of Yahweh.\n\nPower is a principal thing but the path on which we tread to its court matters. I think it is hypocritical fighting a system but at the same time enjoying the dysfunctionality of that system.\n\nThe Edo governorship election has taken its place in the past of gritty and rousing contests. But the lessons from the election will remain fecund in our political discourse. One thing stands out. Nigerians detest the \u2018\u2019contrivances of godfatherism\u2019\u2019. The election is inherently an action against godfatherism and all its appliances. The \u2018Edo no be Lagos\u2019 mantra is a revolutionary shibboleth which conveys the coup de grace to an endemic political scourge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think Bola Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), set up Osagie Ize-Iyamu, candidate of the party, by insufferably putting a demand on the people of Edo state on who they must vote. Nothing irritates more than valorous arrogance.\n\nTinubu over-estimated his influence. That broadcast he did a few days to the election adjuring the people of Edo to reject Obaseki on the grounds that the governor is a dictator in no small measure ricocheted, putting craters to Ize-Iyamu\u2019s ambition. Also, the first rule of godfatherism is \u2018\u2019do not act like a godfather\u2019\u2019. Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman of the APC, broke this canon by stepping beyond the remit of his mortal powers and attempting to wrestle with the celestials. His ego got the better of him. He wanted to whip an \u2018\u2019erring\u2019\u2019 godson to shape but lost himself in the process. He cut off his nose to spite his face.\n\nOshiomhole\u2019s nemesis is graphed in this dictum by my friend, Sulaiman Aledeh: \u2018\u2019Legend has it that there once lived a powerful man who was so disturbed by a rat in his home. He burnt down his house in an attempt to kill this rat. The rat did not die; it jumped out of the inferno leaving the man without a home \u2013 he became homeless.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what is next for Obaseki? Will he rebel against his new \u2018\u2019godfather(s)\u2019\u2019 in the PDP who gave him the platform to fulfil his ambition? And is his re-election the end of godfatherism in Edo as he bravoed? I think not. As I said in a previous article, \u2018\u2019our political process is cannibalistic; it is dog eat dog. National interest succumbs to group and individual interest in our brand of politics. It does not reward rebels or people of independent disposition. To chance on political office, you must contort your principles and personal integrity to fit into the agenda of the keepers of the political platforms, notoriously regarded as the \u2018godfathers\u2019. The godfathers control these political platforms. They hold the reins of political progression. So, as long as the present political ecosystem subsists, godfatherism will remain in Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nReally, I see Obaseki fleeing from one godfather drama to another. The governor will realise soon enough that his new political benefactor, Nyesom Wike is an absolutist; a one of kind godfather. Wike combines brute with arrogance. He does not fancy otherness or contraries. It is his way always.\n\nThe governor of Rivers state runs the PDP \u2013 by virtue of the resources at his disposal. The party conforms to his whim and caprices. It is said in PDP circles, you cannot get anything done in the party without Wike\u2019s blessings. In September 2018, he threatened that there would be consequences if the PDP moved the party\u2019s national convention away from Port Harcourt. The leadership of the party quickly fell in line.\n\nWhen Wike sneezes the PDP catches cold. Clearly, Obaseki understood this as he hurriedly paid obeisance to Wike soon after he defected to the PDP \u2013 when the APC rejected him. In the build-up to the Edo election in June, Wike threatened to withdraw support for Obaseki over a publication alleging he was in cahoots with some persons to stop the Edo governor from participating in the party\u2019s primary election \u2013 and as it is customary there was grovelling and back-bending to the godfather and \u2018\u2019national governor of the PDP\u2019\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWike was named PDP Edo campaign DG principally as a recognition of his pre-eminence in the affairs of the party. He is the PDP. He holds the reins of political progression in the party. He calls the shots. He is the godfather.\n\nBut how well can Obaseki navigate through the relationship maze with Wike who is erratic, impulsive, short-tempered and domineering?\n\nWell, I foresee that there be will spheres of conflict between Obaseki and Wike; not necessarily as regards areas of administration in Edo, but on differences in political interest and pursuits.\n\nObaseki must beware of the new godfather and the godfathers in the PDP. Wike fights dirty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFredrick Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "title": "The untold story of how ThriveAgric survived a turbulent 2020",
          "text": "In September 2020, a few days after Muhammed Akinyemi didn\u2019t receive payment for a 6-month poultry cycle investment made in ThriveAgric, he informed his lawyer about this but didn\u2019t take legal action.\n\nHe was expecting the sum of \u20a6581,000 ($1,200) for the \u20a6510,000 he\u2019d invested in March. Akinyemi had also invested \u20a6200,000 in April, which was due (\u20a6224,000) in October.\n\n\u201cAt first, I just felt it\u2019s money, and it\u2019s with them. Whatever the problems are, within a week or two, they should resolve it,\u201d Akinyemi said. \u201cBut I found out that they hadn\u2019t addressed the issue to all their subscribers; rather they were explaining to individuals. And there was no specificity as to when it would be resolved.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later, Akinyemi\u2019s car broke down and he urgently needed money to fix it. ThriveAgric hadn\u2019t yet paid him and he was running out of patience. He was one out of hundreds of ThriveAgric\u2019s retail investors who hadn\u2019t received the payments.\n\nHis lawyer sent a warning notification to ThriveAgric, threatening to sue if the issue wasn\u2019t resolved. Akinyemi also put out a tweet calling out the company to fix the problem. He tried to rally around other retail investors who hadn\u2019t been paid, but a number of them didn\u2019t want any media attention.\n\n\u201cWe fought it from the legal and social aspect,\u201d said Akinyemi.\n\nOver 500km away, in Southwestern Nigeria Osun State, Esther*, a poultry farmer who partnered with ThriveAgric, had lost over 1,000 birds because there was little to no movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult period losing my birds in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Esther said. She was one out of many farmers within ThriveAgric\u2019s network who suffered massive losses.\n\nWhile the losses incurred varied among the farmers, depending on the capacity of their pens, ThriveAgric shared that there were over 400,000 mature birds that had no buyers. Despite efforts made by ThriveAgric to rent more cold rooms for storage of processed chickens, the lack of buyers and difficulty in moving the birds during the pandemic meant that over 90% of the birds were lost. The losses started happening as early as April 2020, until the end of the year.\n\nWith hundreds of unpaid, angry retail investors dragging ThriveAgric online, asking for their money, and farmers recording millions of naira in losses, this was ThriveAgric\u2019s darkest hour.\n\nFounded by Uka Eje (CEO) and Ayodeji Arikawe (CTO) in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers. It financed agriculture projects through crowdfunding. In the space of 3 years, ThriveAgric had grown to become a notable African Agritech startup, with backing from Y Combinator\u2014one of the world\u2019s most successful startup accelerators\u2014in 2019.\n\nHow did it get into this mess?\n\n\u201cIt was a mix of different events. The pandemic meant that offtakers couldn\u2019t pay for the goods we\u2019ve already supplied,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFarmers were also suffering losses in the farm, and we lost over 100 million naira worth of produce in transit because they were held up on the road. No movement during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for ThriveAgric was that its owing offtakers\u2014FMCGs and restaurant chains\u2014made repeated failed promises on when they\u2019d repay.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d promise to pay next week and, banking on their words because they hadn\u2019t defaulted before, we\u2019d in turn promise our retail investors that they\u2019ll be paid next week, only for the offtakers to go quiet,\u201d Eje said.\n\nThe offtakers too were anticipating that the pandemic would wind down and business activities would return, but it took longer than expected. This affected ThriveAgric\u2019s communication with its retail investors as it repeatedly failed to fulfil the promises it made to its retail investors. The fact that its large network of farmers were also experiencing losses also exacerbated the situation as ThriveAgric had invested in them by providing seeds and chicks, expecting to receive returns when they were sold. Many of those farmers haven\u2019t recovered from those losses till today.\n\nA popular question that came up during this period was whether ThriveAgric\u2019s claims to be covered by insurance were true. The company explained that the insurance covered the farming activities and not the retail investors\u2019 investment\u2014the logic being, if the farming process went well, the returns on the investment by the retail investors were guaranteed. Also, in this situation, the fact that farmers were unable to sell and the offtakers were owing weren\u2019t valid bases for requesting for insurance claims.\n\nAmerican serial entrepreneur Elon Musk once described the experience of running a startup as being similar to the act of chewing glass and staring into the abyss. \u201cAfter a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends,\u201d Musk said. ThriveAgric\u2019s experience validates this description.\n\nAll through this turbulent phase, the company maintains it didn\u2019t take its retail investors for granted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we realised was that this money we were owing was important for these people; for some it was house rent or school fees,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt was money that meant a lot to them. Regardless of how people reacted, it was their money, and they needed it back.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSalvaging the situation\n\nAs the situation escalated, different parties showed up to help out.\n\n\u201cWe stepped in as quickly as we got wind of the situation and did the best that we could at the time by guiding the team on the right approach to take, as well as by providing the practical support they needed in what was a very time-sensitive situation,\u201d said Kola Aina, General Partner, Ventures Platform, one of ThriveAgric\u2019s investors.\n\nVentures platform helped with recruiting an interim CEO, Adia Sowho, who was then VP of Growth and Managing Director, Nigeria, for credit platform Migo. It also restructured the finance and communications team.\n\nWhen ThriveAgric came knocking, the first question Sowho had to answer was \u201cDid she care enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question for me was, do I care enough about ThriveAgric and what it\u2019s doing? And am I willing, because I wasn\u2019t bored,\u201c Sowho said.\n\nWith the answer to that question being yes, in October Sowho agreed to step in, with Eje stepping down to the role of chief operating officer (COO).\n\n\u201cFood security is an important part of our economy. It doesn\u2019t get enough love and support as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cIf every Nigerian were a farmer, we\u2019d be feeding ourselves and the continent, which is literally ThriveAgric\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nSolving for Y\n\nTasked to initiate a turnaround in a new company and entirely different sector, the guiding principle Sowho turned to was first-principles thinking, a reverse engineering technique that has its origins from the teachings of Aristotle and has been made recently popular by leaders in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFor me, I tend to work with first principles. At the end of the day, whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, whether it\u2019s a startup, enterprise, or even conglomerate turnaround,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThey all involve the two or more parties exchanging value. With ThriveAgric there was an equation and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this hazy chain of unfulfilled agreement that just ended up in a crisis. And, of course, when it hits the public sphere, it makes the news.\u201d\n\nTo fix the broken equation, Sowho deployed three things: structure, governance, and documentation, concepts she claims startups tend to be wary of. The different teams and processes were restructured in order for the company to solve existing problems and be \u201c10 steps ahead of any risk before it materialises\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things I did were an outcome of the experience that I have working in building organisations,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen by accident. The success of any enterprise has to be by design.\u201d\n\nSowho and Eje worked on structuring the financing plan for the repayment of the retail investors and hiring for key roles. Alongside Sowho, a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a head of risk were hired. As the new hires got to work, stabilising the ship, co-founder and CTO Arikawe couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they joined the company at such a time.\n\n\u201cThese people joined us during the crisis. I was thinking, didn\u2019t you look up ThriveAgric online, a company that people are bashing, before joining,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nThe typical response from the new hires was that they believed in what the company was doing and were willing to put their names on the line.\n\n\u201cOur CFO joined us and 2 days later he\u2019s on a call where investors were insulting him,\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cA similar incident happened with Sowho, who joined and 1 week later had 300 angry people on a Zoom call with her.\u201d\n\nIn a few months, the presence of additional hands, fresh ideas, and the \u201cbridge\u201d capital (temporary financing) provided by Ventures Platform helped stabilise ThriveAgric.\n\nTransparency\u2014the currency of trust\n\nDuring this period, members of the support team and other departments had to work overnight for many days.\n\n\u201cEveryone was stretched but we had a lot of empathy for the people and also a sense of responsibility to ensure that things don\u2019t go wrong again,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nOn one of those nights, the engineering team in collaboration with the support team, decided to enhance transparency around the repayment schedule by creating a new payout dashboard\u2014Payout.thriveagric.com\u2014that reflected each retail investor\u2019s exact repayment date.\n\nThis was done to fix an issue with the initial payment dashboard which automatically indicated that the retail investors had been paid, as soon as it was due date. This feature caused retailer investors to be confused and angry, because they hadn\u2019t been paid.\n\n\u201cWhen we initially built the payout dashboard we didn\u2019t foresee a period like this where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay. People always got paid on or before payout day,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nWith the new payout dashboard, the retail investors could also see how many other people have been paid. A feature which the engineering team hoped would provide extra comfort and ease tension.\n\nUtilising the bridge loan secured, over the span of 9 months ThriveAgric was able to pay back the hundreds of customers it was owing. Akinyemi was paid in November and December 2020. ThriveAgric also repaid the bridge loan in 2021.\n\nUnexpected support and lessons\n\nDuring the turbulent period, there was a lot of pushback from retail investors but also surprisingly a lot of support from investors, financiers, and friends.\n\n\u201cI remember people calling and asking, what\u2019s the challenge, what do you need?\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cFor example, one of the people we sold birds to but hadn\u2019t paid called to apologise that he\u2019s trying his best. He was owing us because someone else was owing him.\u201d\n\nAfter 6 months at the helm of ThriveAgric, Sowho left to join telecom giant MTN Nigeria as its first-ever female Chief Marketing Officer while Eje returned to the position of CEO. During his time as COO, Eje worked on ensuring that repayment and communications with different stakeholders happened seamlessly.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I ensured that the core business operations ran smoothly and built a system to ensure that the defaulting offtakers paid,\u201d Eje said. \u201cI also identified other funding opportunities outside crowdfunding.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on her experience, she said, \u201cYou often wonder whether you can hack it with a turnaround, and I did, so that\u2019s one thing I learned. Now people are calling me the queen of turnaround after one event.\u201d\n\nAnother valuable lesson for Sowho was how she was able to manage her productivity considering that she joined ThriveAgric during the pandemic and managed things virtually.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how focused I could be, because I\u2019m one of those people that like to do everything all the time, all at once,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cBut I think in this situation, the urgency required that I stay very focused.\u201d\n\nThere were ThriveAgric team members she didn\u2019t meet until about 2\u20133 months into the job, because she was very focused on talking to the people nearest to this issue.\n\nFor the team at ThriveAgric, the incident was a learning moment for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning to scale with structure. Right now as we explore different opportunities, we look at the risks and how to scale sustainably,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re still certain about what we want to do. It\u2019s still day one.\u201d\n\nKola Aina believes the incident was a reminder as an investor that \u201csupporting companies through difficult times is one of the truest forms of portfolio support.\u201d\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nThriveAgric has since paused crowdfunding from retail investors to focus on institutional investors. Since the pivot, ThriveAgric has sealed investment partnerships with several commercial banks, the CBN, World Food Program, and USAID. Its landmark partnership came recently in the form of a one-year project in partnership with USAID-backed West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub).\n\nThe partnership, which aims to empower at least 50,000 farmers across Nigeria, will be supported with a $1.75 million co-investment grant from Trade Hub. The startup is also focusing on building out its farmer-centred technology solutions which currently serves over 200,000 farmers. The company\u2019s focus is to build the largest network of profitable farmers across Africa.\n\n\u201cAgritech is not just about having a website and asking people for money,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building the infrastructure that supports the food production value chain.\u201d\n\nSultan Quadri contributed to this story.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian government shuts down 6 illegal digital loan companies",
          "text": "On Friday, 3 Nigerian federal government agencies\u2014Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission (ICPC)\u2014collaborated with the Nigerian police force to raid some illegal financial institutions operating from their Opebi Road offices in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Punch, digital lending platforms like GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Easi Moni, KashKash, and Speedy Choice were among the busted companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe FCCPC, which led the joint operation, said the raid was a response to several customers\u2019 complaints about the malpractices carried out by financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking at the raid, the CEO at FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the agency started investigating and monitoring these companies in 2020 when consumers started accusing them of mishandling and violating their private data in the process of loan recovery.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. When the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise of money lenders,\u201d Irukera said. \u201cBecause of the lockdown, people needed small and instant loans to sustain, which is understandable. But, over a period of time, people started to complain about the malpractice of the lenders so we started tracking it.\u201d\n\nIrukera also mentioned that, towards the end of last year, the agency had gathered a lot of information and started working with some other key agencies to monitor these businesses.\n\nAccording to Irukera, their findings so far are: the interest rate charged by these digital lenders appears to violate the ethics of how lending is done; secondly, the unethical loan recovery practice of violating customers\u2019 privacy to abuse and shame them and their acquaintances.\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms, which has been very difficult. These companies move around a lot, and it took us several months visiting each of their locations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FCCPC boss, however, said investigations also revealed that the loan firms weren\u2019t Nigerian nor registered in the country, they don\u2019t have an address nor do they have a licence to do business in Nigeria. He also said that most of these companies operated from the same place and by the same person.\n\nWith no address, all these companies have are mobile apps that can be downloaded on both Google and Apple Stores. So the agency had to engage the people who have been their victims and gather more evidence.\n\nBy now, all the agencies involved had gotten enough information and evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for them to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure.\n\n\u201cAnd sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation, which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we were hitting at the place where we could get many of them,\u201d said the FCCPC boss.\n\nHe also mentioned that the agency had issued an order to Apple and Google to take down these companies\u2019 apps from their platforms. It has also ordered the banks to freeze these companies\u2019 bank accounts.\n\nLast year, when NITDA sanctioned Sokoloan, TechCabal reported that that would be the first of many. Though it took longer than expected, it\u2019s finally happening.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones\u2014no. We want to start with them. We also understand that there are between 5 and 7 companies operating at the same location,\u201d said Irukera, hinting at the agency\u2019s ambition to cleanse the nation of all illegal digital lending practices.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "How Pivo is providing fast and reliable financial services for Africa\u2019s supply chain businesses",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 90% of businesses and 50% of employment globally. In addition, SMEs create 7 out of 10 jobs in emerging economies. Consequently, ensuring that SMEs have a good environment to thrive in is crucial for job creation and economic growth.\n\nHowever, an inability to access finance for their business operations means many SMEs have to close shop. In Nigeria, for example, banks are more likely to give loans to large businesses. Over the past five years, startups like FairMoney and Brass have stepped up, providing individuals and businesses with an alternative to existing financial institutions.\n\nLast year, Nigeria\u2019s fintech space saw a new entrant \u2013 Pivo. The startup was founded by Nkiru Amadi-Emina (CEO) and Ijeoma Akwiwu (COO) as a result of an observation the two women had. Before Pivo, Amadi-Emina had founded Jalo, a logistics startup that served businesses in Northern Nigeria until its acquisition by Kobo360.\n\nThe deal, an acqui-hire, saw Amadi-Emina join Kobo360, where she held various positions, including Port Operations Lead. Akwiwu, on her part, had spent most of her career working as a lawyer and building her private practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer jobs saw her working with various tech companies, and she was soon curious about other services a lawyer could offer startups. Seeing this interest, a friend offered her the opportunity to work on a project to curb corruption in Nigeria\u2019s judicial sector. While the project never saw the light of day, it gave her more insight into opportunities in the tech space and led her to get a master\u2019s in software engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNkiru Amadi-Emina (CEO) and Ijeoma Akwiwu (COO) of Pivo Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nThe duo also ran businesses together, and their experience showed them that many small businesses in the supply chain industry struggled with financing. Trying to solve that problem led them to start Pivo.\n\n\u201cHaving worked at Kobo360 and then also built a source procurement product together, we found that a lot of the small players in both scenarios have issues with financing or completing transactions that they get.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a case of they don\u2019t have any business or orders; nobody is giving them cargo to load or orders to fulfil. They had it but didn\u2019t have the financial capital to fulfil it. Having noticed that problem, we decided to build Pivo to provide them with adequate financial support,\u201d Amadi-Emina told Techpoint Africa.\n\nFinancial services for supply chain SMEs\n\nPivo is a financial services provider targeted at SMEs in Africa\u2019s supply chain sector. The decision to focus on businesses in the supply chain sector comes from the founders\u2019 expertise working in the industry and an understanding that there\u2019s a supply chain segment to most sectors of the African economy.\n\n\u201cWe have experience in the supply chain industry. We also understand that a supply chain is a function that cuts across multiple sectors, whether you\u2019re in manufacturing, agriculture, or oil and gas. More importantly, in any supply chain, the actors remain the same,\u201d Amadi-Emina said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of Pivo\u2019s website\n\nWhile other startups provide businesses with working capital, what sets Pivo apart is its focus on a set of businesses. The startup has rolled out its first offering \u2013 Pivo Capital \u2013 a loan service for supply chain businesses, but it is not stopping at that. It plans to offer every financial service that a supply chain business needs, including inventory financing, corporate account services, asset financing, etc.\n\nSince its private beta launched in October 2021, the startup has gotten over 250 clients (200 of which are active), received loan requests of over $2 million, and disbursed over $1 million to date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially bootstrapped by the co-founders, the startup has raised an undisclosed pre-seed round from investors including Mercy Corps Ventures, Microtraction, Ventures Platform, FirstCheck Africa, and Bold Angel Fund. Pivo has also gotten into the ODX accelerator programme, where it will receive $125,000 for 7% equity.\n\nThe startup has three core products \u2013 Pivo Capital, Pivo Finance, and Pivo Plus. For Pivo Capital, the startup charges an interest rate and management fee on all loans disbursed. The interest rates are not fixed and vary depending on the loan amount and the company involved. However, Akwiwu disclosed that the minimum interest rate is 3%.\n\nFor Pivo Finance, the startup\u2019s corporate banking service, the startup plans to provide businesses with account numbers, wallets, and the ability to conduct transactions using their Pivo accounts. Although not all the offerings are currently available, the startup plans to charge transaction fees on any transaction done using Pivo.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nCurrently operating in Lagos, the startup has its eyes on Nigeria\u2019s other commercial cities, including Port Harcourt, Abuja, and Kano, before expanding to other African countries, starting with Ghana in Q4 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Pivo staff educating a customer on Pivo\u2019s services\n\nLike any business, the startup has faced its fair share of challenges, including keeping up with the growth of its loan portfolio and hiring the right talent. On keeping up with its loan portfolio, Akwiwu said the company has had to work closely with its financial partners.\n\n\u201cI think the major problem we\u2019ve had is primarily around keeping up with the growth that we are seeing. An example is that your loan portfolio is growing, but do you have enough capital to support that growth? One of the ways we\u2019re mitigating it is quickly activating credit lines with financial partners at the same pace of our portfolio growth.\u201d\n\nOn the talent front, Akwiwu revealed that the startup still has most of its founding team, while Amadi-Emina shared that they have been intentional about their hires.\n\n\u201cOne thing we try to do is to be deliberate and intentional about hiring because what you find is, if you make the right hire, they\u2019re able to compensate for other gaps in your structure,\u201d Akwiwu added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCadana is a platform that allows African workers to get paid on demand instead of waiting till the end of the month, unlocking their earnings in real-time.\u201d \u2014 Albert Owusu-Asare, Cadana CEO.\n\nDigitising payroll and human resources (HR) is one of the many services that Cadana offers, but the true mission of the startup is to accelerate wealth building for African workers by making their earnings available to them when they need it.\n\nIn a conversation with Techpoint Africa, Cadana Co-founder and CEO, Owusu-Asare, discussed his motivation for creating the startup and why he thinks on-demand salary could help Africans accelerate wealth creation.\n\nGrowing up in Ghana, Owusu-Asare came from a modest background and, at an early age, knew how vital payday was. He recalled how families waited earnestly for the day their pay would come in to sort out financial problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could see first hand how my parents were working very hard to make sure we got the best experiences growing up. From there, I observed the role that jobs played in our lives.\u201d\n\nBuilding Cadana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana Co-Founder. L-R. Owusu-Asare and Ameer Shujjah\n\nOwusu-Asare has a wealth of experience in the fintech world, and Cadana isn\u2019t the first fintech he has been a part of. He was the CTO and Co-founder of Esusu, a New York-headquartered startup that became a unicorn in January 2022.\n\nBut his finance journey didn\u2019t start at Esusu; it began at Goldman Sachs. Owusu-Asare left Ghana for the US to study. There, he met a friend \u2014 Ameer Shujjah \u2014 who would become his Co-founder and CTO at Cadana.\n\nShujjah and Owusu-Asare were the only computer science and physics majors in the university they attended. And their love for computer science and physics bolstered their friendship over a decade.\n\nAfter university, Owusu-Asare took to Wall Street and landed a job with Goldman Sachs. He was an engineer at the investment bank and helped build a digital lending platform there. Through this, he became one of the first engineers to work on the Apple Card.\n\n\u201cIt was a joint partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs to create a very modern credit card experience for millions of Americans, and that, to me, was when my journey with credit began.\u201d\n\nHe drew upon his experience with Apple Card when he became the CTO at Esusu. What Esusu does is to help low and middle-income earners in the US survive the credit system the country was built on.\n\n\u201cIn America, everything is tied to the credit score; if your credit score drops, you\u2019re done. So many low to middle-income earners were trapped in this credit score cycle. So, every time people pay their rent every month, we use it as a mechanism to help them improve their credit score.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEsusu\u2019s success opened Owusu-Asare\u2019s eyes to how technology can create access to wealth-building opportunities, and he left the US to bring those opportunities to Africa.\n\n\u201cI left Esusu because I just had a passion for Africa.\u201d\n\nWhy Cadana?\n\nOwusu-Asare thought of several ways to impact the African continent significantly, and Cadana came to mind. To him, Africa\u2019s greatest resource is its people, and they must get access to funds when they need them.\n\n\u201cVery similar to Esusu, I realised that the monthly pay cycle is something that has been on for years or even centuries. I thought, why do we pay people once a month?\n\n\u201cToday you can order an Uber right to your doorstep; you can sit in your home and order food at the touch of a button. Why can\u2019t salaries be as real-time as Uber? That was where the idea started.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to assume Cadana is a platform that provides credit access to salary earners, but it is not. It simply gives them access to their salary before the payday.\n\nHow does Cadana work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana website\n\nWhile Cadana provides salary on-demand, there are limits to the time and amount of the salary that can be demanded. Owusu-Asare said, \u201cWe understand that certain guardrails need to be put in place so that you can be as efficient with your money as possible.\n\n\u201cWhat Cadana does is to partner with your business; we always go through your employer so that we understand where you work and how much you earn. Certain employers tell us they want to give employees access to 50% of their money or 30% of their money.\n\n\u201cWe also work with the employer to put a transaction limit so people do not abuse it. So these are the control measures we have put in.\u201d\n\nEssentially, employees do not have to pay any form of interest for getting their salary early. Cadana pays the salary and gets the money back from the employer when the payment is due.\n\nSo how does Cadana makes money?\n\nIt is essential to see Cadana as a payment platform and a salary on-demand platform. The platform makes its money by charging a transaction fee of $1 (\u20a6415) whenever salary is demanded.\n\nOwusu-Asare explained that the transaction fee is split between Cadana and its payment partners.\n\n\u201cWe work with our payment partners to actually disperse the money to their bank accounts or in Ghana to their mobile money accounts. Part of that fee goes to the payment providers, and we put a spread on what we do.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Cadana also offers a gamut of payment services from which it makes money. According to Owusu-Asare, it is a very holistic all in one platform that allows businesses to run payroll, pay vendors and suppliers, and generate invoices.\n\nWith these multiple streams of income, he said the company has a sustainable business model which will help them add more value to the employee.\n\n\u201cOur biggest value proposition is always the employee and the experience we are giving to them.\u201d\n\nHow Cadana stands out from the crowd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana website home-page\n\nWhen it comes to digitising payroll and HR, Cadana is in the same league as Bento and SeamlessHR. However, its on-demand salary offering sets it apart. In explaining how Cadana\u2019s positioning is different from others, Owusu-Asare said, \u201cWe are positioning ourselves first and foremost as a payment company.\n\n\u201cOur positioning is actually powerful because by making the businesses and their money movement as efficient as possible, you can pass on some of those efficiency gains to employees.\u201d\n\nWhile Cadana stands out from the payroll and HR crowd with its on-demand salary and payment services, it\u2019s still in the same boat with Earnipay, another on-demand salary platform that recently raised a $4 million seed round.\n\nJust like Cadana, Earnipay charges transaction fees between \u20a6250 and \u20a6450 ($0.60 and $1.08) for processing transactions.\n\nHowever, Owusu-Asare assured that in the coming months, Cadana would have product offerings that offer salary on-demand and services like payment and investment that will complete its mission of wealth acquisition.\n\nRisks and challenges to offering on-demand salaries in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana team\n\nCadana launched in Ghana but has expanded to Nigeria as part of a partnership with African fintech giant, Flutterwave. But how easy is it to offer these services in Africa, or perhaps what does Cadana do when employers do not pay salaries after an employee has demanded salary?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be risks, but we focus a lot on employers that pay their people on time and are forward-thinking,\u201d Owusu-Asare said.\n\nWhile focusing on employers that pay on time could reduce the risks for Cadana, he also admitted that the space Cadana is playing in is new, and businesses that they onboard have to be educated.\n\n\u201cWe have internal teams that spend a lot of time with these businesses, trying to help them understand that their employees can spend over five hours at work dealing with their financial issues instead of working.\n\n\u201cWe also try to help them understand that when an employee quits or gets sacked for being unproductive, they actually spend a lot more money replacing that person.\u201d\n\nEducating employers on the importance of a healthy relationship then becomes the major challenge for Cadana, an obstacle Owusu-Asare believes they will overcome in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

So, those were the two things that we set out to look for.\u201d\n\nThe adoption and implementation of data protection and privacy laws in Nigeria seem to be gaining momentum and is creating more awareness around it. Hopefully, more moves are made to protect citizens\u2019 privacy.\n\nFighting racially-biased technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my second trick, I\u2019ll be stringing together three words to make a story: Artificial Intelligence (AI), bias, race. Okay, let\u2019s make that four words.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the big idea? Despite the supposed infallibility of AI, it relies on datasets it has been fed. Essentially, the technology is only as smart as the data it is given, at first at least. It is expected that it grows and learns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, issues arise when the data contains some level of bias. This could take different forms, and for Africans or black people, it often results in discrimination or unrepresentative information.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) launched the \u201cfirst-ever\u201d African Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence (ARCAI) in the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe centre is located in the Denis Sassou-N\u2019guesso University of Kint\u00e9l\u00e9 and offers a Masters of Science Degree in Artificial Intelligence and data science in collaboration with the university.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched an AI lab in Ghana, hoping to foster more African involvement in the development of AI and reduce bias. Also, in 2018, Data Science Nigeria created Nigeria\u2019s first AI hub.\n\nAlthough not the first, the establishment of the ARCAI is a step in the right direction in solving the issue of racial abuse and AI.\n\nWhat you missed last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a great week!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "As Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate remains high, fast-moving consumer goods (FCMG) companies are facing up to rising costs, and consumers are on the receiving end as they are paying more for the same or even less value.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the continued rise in the production cost of manufacturing companies, especially those in the FMCG segment, was affecting profitability, product quality, and consumer demand.\n\nMost manufacturers have had to increase their retail prices while maintaining the same value or, in some cases, reducing the value of their products.\n\nAlfred Olajide, the managing director of Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited, while speaking at a virtual event on Thursday, lamented what he described as the \u201cexponential increase in costs and limited ability to pass it to consumers, who are also under pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, this year alone, an average sugar cost has gone up by 20 percent, plastic resins have more than doubled in terms of prices, aluminium bodies, cane bodies are up by almost 100 percent. And this is in addition to all the challenges of poor infrastructure, supply chain disruptions and logistics,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerians saw the inflation rate jump to a record high of 18.17 percent in March last year as prices of goods rose amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA 70g of Superbite sausage roll, which was sold for N50, was reduced to 60g, but its price increased to N60; the price of a 5ocl Coca-Cola drink increased from N100\n\nto N200, while the price of a loaf of bread increased from N250 to N500.\n\n\u201cLast month, I ordered pizza for my children at the usual price, but the pizza was smaller and it did not have the usual chicken or meat toppings, sources, and other things that make it attractive and appealing. I was disappointed because I did not get value for my money,\u201d a mother of two, who simply identified herself as Damilola, said.\n\nWithin a period of six years, the Nigerian economy slipped into a recession twice owing to the collapse of oil prices, the latest was induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, weakening consumers\u2019 purchasing power, causing job losses, and throwing millions into poverty.\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, in its MAN CEOs Confidence Index, said manufacturers\u2019 production and distribution costs increased by 21 percent in the second quarter of 2021, adding the hike in production costs caused a 29 percent decline in the volume of production.\n\nRead also: Market research company Survey54 uncovers key insights for FMCG businesses\n\nA BusinessDay analysis of the financial statements of six FMCGs, namely Nestle Nigeria Plc, Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc, Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, Northern Nigeria Flour Mills Plc, and NASC Allied Industries showed that their combined cost of sales rose by 44 percent for the nine months the period ended September 2021 to N1.17 trillion from N820 billion in the same period of 2020.\n\nThe cost increased by 82 percent when compared with the N648 billion spent in the same period of 2019, which was before the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, the firms reported a combined profit after tax of N68 billion, which was a 10 percent decline from the N76 billion achieved in 2020.\n\nCadbury Nigeria Plc, Unilever Nigeria Plc, and Nigerian Breweries Plc, recorded a collective production cost of N363 billion for full-year 2021, a 22 percent increase from the N297 billion expended in 2020, and a 30 percent increase from N278 billion in 2019.\n\nBefore the pandemic, high inflationary pressures, low incomes, and weak purchasing power prompted some companies to repack their products into smaller sachets at affordable prices.\n\nPascal Odibo, group country director at Jeff & O\u2019Brien Knowledge, Africa, highlighted the need for FMCG companies to find innovative ways to attract more customers.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor example, taking the products to the customer directly, cutting off middlemen which sometimes represent a cut in the income of large institutions or develop new products that will serve the need of their present challenges.\n\n\u201cWhat happens most times is that those people that are supposed to think out new and strategic ways of improving the business don\u2019t enter the mode of superior thinking but cost-cutting,\u201d he said.\n\nUchenna Uzo, faculty director at Lagos Business School, said, \u201cIf prices need to go up and organizations are not matching the prices with an increase in value, at the end, it will be a ticking clock for them.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that sooner or later, they will notice that people are shifting to other brands that are nurturing their value needs.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, FMCG companies can either offer the small value in smaller quantities or offer the same value but add freebies.\n\n\u201cThis will make customers appreciate that you have taken a step forward to show that you care for them. Also, how the price increase is communicated is also\n\nimportant. There are different ways you can communicate an increase that will not make people feel that it is an increase at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, an analyst at United Capital Plc, said most FMCG companies were stuck between maintaining product quality and increasing the prices of their products.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the moment, they are doing the best possible they can in terms of bringing the balance between quality and cost.\n\n\u201cSo, the only thing they need to improve on is to see how they can manage the number of materials they can put in these products so that they can still improve the\n\nthe quality or they increase the quality of the products and let their margins suffer a bit.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jide Babatope, a Lagos-based analyst, one way FMCG companies can cut the rising costs is to intensify efforts on local input sourcing, which seems to be more cost-effective than importing raw materials.\n\nHe said, \u201cFMCGs product portfolios are elastic in nature, meaning the kinds of products they manufacture have many substitutes; hence, these companies can redesign their product portfolios into cheaper and more affordable brands while being intentional about quality.\n\n\u201cBig FMCG players can afford to raise the prices of their products while still maintaining market share because of their brand reputation and a sizeable chunk of their customer base are value brands, but smaller businesses are more disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nIbrahim Tajudeen, head of research at Chapel Hill Denham, stressed the need for FMCG companies to maintain quality and ensure that consumers get good value for money.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, they will run to alternatives. Consumer taste is very important in my view. But in trying to cater to consumer taste, manufacturers should come up with strategies that will make sure that people are able to get something for the size of their pocket.\u201d",

It\u2019s that risk we try to mitigate by encouraging them not to migrate through the Sahara Desert.\n\n\u201cWe accepted the problem facing us and set up a taskforce to deal with the problem. We took up the responsibility of resettling returnees, tackling the root cause of the problem, dealing with perpetrators and understanding migration in the context of development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that what is happening in the country today and the very difficult economic situation that is emerging will put pressure on young people to want to travel again. I don\u2019t believe that our response should be the same as we did in Migration 1.0 as we may not be able to prevent irregular migration,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cOur strategy for Migration 2.0 is to work with destination countries and the federal government to look for pathways for regular migration. Post-COVID-19, a lot of the destination countries require labour and we have no excuse not to prepare our people properly to migrate safely.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss with the Italian Ambassador as we strategize on how to prepare and structure proper labour contracts, train and prepare our people to travel and do their job regularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Migration 2.0, we would expect you to work closely with us to look at the data we have and support some other intervention programmes that we have. Migration 2.0 for us, is that every player in the spectrum needs to sit across the table with us to enable us to know what you are doing and how to optimise resources together to strengthen our partnership, reducing waste and achieving more,\u201d Obaseki noted\n\nReassuring that his government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow them to achieve their fullest potentials, Obaseki further stated, \u201cIn Edo State, we will encourage our women to come up and be part of the political process to ensure we have equal female representation in the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with the representation in the executive and judiciary. Our task is to make sure that in Edo State, our women have due representation in the legislature.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Dankabo commended Obaseki commended Obaseki for his affirmative action for women in his cabinet and the government\u2019s commitment to the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Comrade Philip Shaibu is, to say the least, most unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Wike was one who is wont to show respect and courtesy to his colleague-governors, he would have ordinarily reached out to me to express his concerns about the views made by my deputy governor, rather than embarking on this unwarranted public onslaught.\n\n\u201cMy deputy governor was a former National President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and his comment is representative of the essence of the nation\u2019s youth population, who are inclined to openly speak up and question the status quo. If Governor Wike cannot understand and adequately respond to the style and character of the Nigerian youth, how can he aspire to lead them?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Governor Wike should have taken a cue from the manner in which the National Chairman of our party, Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, responded to my deputy\u2019s remarks, as a conscientious leader who is able to show empathy and consideration.\n\n\u201cThe concerns expressed by my deputy governor bordered on pertinent issues affecting the PDP in Edo State which since the September 19th 2020 elections, has been able to register over 500,000 members; and till date, these new members have not been properly integrated into our party after two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAlso, the leaders, executives and members who came with me into the party have still not been accepted, integrated or harmonized into the party.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the fact that old members of Edo PDP, who are open to inclusion and supportive of building a large party are being vilified and ostracized by a cabal purportedly led by Chief Dan Orbih, who is your perpetual guest in Port Harcourt and is remotely used to orchestrate the destabilization of the party in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to recall at this point that a political solution gave rise to the emergence of Chief Dan Orbih first as Acting and then as Substantive National Vice Chairman, South South, of our party, when Chief Emma Odidi resigned that position to allow Chief Orbih to ascend.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore curious why this type of political solution is no longer tenable to resolve the political impasse in Edo State PDP.\n\n\u201cWe can categorically state that in the comments of the deputy governor, he at no point threatened the party as Governor Wike has alleged. Rather, it is Governor Wike, who has at different times, threatened the PDP. Some of these instances include:\n\n1. On September 16, 2018, Governor Wike threatened the party that there would be grave consequences if it moved the National Convention from Port Harcourt in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.\n\n2. On September 12, 2019, Governor Wike also threatened to cause trouble for the party over the emergence of Hon. Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nNoting that Governor Wike has contributed to the advancement of the party, just like others, since 1999, he stressed: \u201cNo one is against his desire to run for president, however, his ambition should not be embarked on in such a way that it would cause disruption at different levels, such as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum as well as different chapters of the party across the country.\n\n\u201cIt clearly amounts to delusion of grandeur, for any one man to nurse the idea that he owns or has more stake in the PDP and everyone should pander to him.\n\n\u201cWe are all equal stakeholders in the party and an aggregate of the ideas, opinions and contributions of all leaders and members should form the position of the party and not the view of one individual or a select few.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Wike is free to use his resources as he deems fit in pursuit of his ambition, he should not attempt to cow, intimidate, cajole and threaten others into doing his bidding. Edo State cannot and will not be procured for anyone\u2019s personal ambition.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs now are strong democratic institutions and not strong men; that is why we will join the great leaders of our party across the country to build PDP into a strong, large and indomitable party that will win next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike and his collaborators headed by Chief Dan Orbih in Edo State will not succeed in destabilizing the PDP in Edo State as they did other states like Cross River just to secure delegates to actualize his alleged personal ambition to run for presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cIn Edo, we don\u2019t accept political bullies and overlords and historically, we have demonstrated our capacity to unshackle ourselves and dethrone bullies and highhanded leaders.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all well-meaning leaders of our great party to call Governor Wike to order to desist from his current unguarded and disruptive tendencies. From all indications today, PDP is set to take over the leadership of Nigeria provided we can rein in the self interest of a few leaders to put the task of rescuing Nigeria above their personal ambitions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Hope rises as Anambra awaits Soludo",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nOn Thursday, March 17, former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, will be sworn in as the governor of Anambra State in what will mark the beginning of a new era; the post Willie Obiano era.\n\nInteracting with everyday people in Awka, Anambra\u2019s administrative capital, one can feel an intense sense of optimism, but also anxiety, ahead of the inauguration. But there is a prevailing sense that the incoming chief executive, with experience, expertise and sound knowledge of economics, will deliver the goods.\n\nWe expect him to do well; everyone, except those profiting from Obianos government, is hopeful, said Mr. Chidi Nwafor, a rice dealer at Eke Awka, the citys market. He should bring sanity to governance, put a stop to the menace of touts and give infrastructure.\n\nAnambra people dont expect government to solve their problems. All they need is for the right environment to be created. I expect Soludo to build roads, and if possible, connect the cities with rail. When these are done, the people will do the rest themselves.\n\nA core professional; a professor of economics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, whose work profile includes member of the British Department for International Development International Advisory Group, visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund, the University of Cambridge, the Brookings Institution, the University of Warwick, the University of Oxford and Swarthmore College (USA), as well as a consultant for a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nWith this background, Anambra could not have hoped for a better governor at this stage when in many peoples views, the successes recorded under Mr. Peter Obi who was governor between 2006 and 2014, have been rolled back by his successor, Chief Willie Obiano who is billed to handover to Soludo next month.\n\nAnambra had started on a very positive trajectory after the chaotic reign of its first governor in the Fourth Republic, Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju, whose performance was constrained by his godfather, Chuef Emeka Offor, when in 2003 Dr. Chris Ngige, now Minister of Labour, emerged governor under the Peoples Democratic Party and decided to put an end to the menace of godfatherism.\n\nHe embarked on massive infrastructural development, but his decision to turn against his godfathers, notably the Uba Family, cost him his seat, paving the way for Mr. Obi who reclaimed his 2003 mandate through the court in 2006 and carried on from where Ngige stopped.\n\nBy the time Obi left office in 2014, Anambra had been radically transformed, boasting of the best intrastate road network of any state in the country, even as he saved N70 billions for the state. But Chief Obiano, the outgoing governor who replaced Mr. Obi in 2014, had failed to measure up in many peoples reckoning to the standard set by his predecessor.\n\nTouts have returned to Onitsha, the states commercial city; roads have become bad, and within the eight years hes been governor, Anambra has gone from a domestic debt profile of N2.5 billion as at December 31, 2014 to N54.6 billion as at September 30, 2021, according to DMO figures. The external debt profile also went from $45 million as at December 31, 2014 to $108 million as at December 31, 2020.\n\nObianos tenure has been generally uninspiring, said Charles Okeke, a political analyst. If you look at his tenure holistically, you will see that he performed poorly. He allowed political jobbers to have a field day. Most of them are angry now because they have seen that it wont be business as usual under Soludo.\n\nRegardless, he built some roads and gave Anambra its first airport. Thats also commendable, even if we can argue about the amount spent not being commensurate with the quality of work done.\n\nObiano also uplifted the face of Awka, developing it into a relatively modern state capital with three flyovers among other projects, but generally fell short of building on Obis legacy. Ahead of Soludos inauguration, many say they are hopeful of a return to the Obi years, or even something better.\n\nSoludo has what it takes to do well, Okeke said. He has the pedigree, the experience and from his pronouncements so far, we have reason to be very hopeful. But lets not be too optimistic because you never know.\n\nActivities leading up to the inauguration have indeed given many of the states populace, if not the entire Southeast region, reasons to be hopeful that this time, Anambra has gotten it right.\n\nFirst was the transition committee the governor-elect set up, which included seasoned professionals like Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, former minister of education and World Bank Vice President who heads the committee; Prof. Benedict Oramah, president of Afreximbank; foremost economist, Prof. Pat Utomi; Mr. Osita Chidika, former Aviation Minister, among other high profile individuals.\n\nThe transition committee list, which has also been criticised for being too long, regardless passes across two key messages: one, that his administration wont be about job for the boys, and two, that he is out to run a pan Igbo government and wont be limited to his Anambra enclave.\n\nHe had indeed promised to poach talents from everywhere, and speaking at the transition committees inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, January 26, he noted that Anambra is a state in the South East and is not an island unto itself, so we will seek the cooperation and collaboration of other states, especially South-East and South-South states, this will be critical for creating this prosperous homeland.\n\nApart delivering good governance, Soludo, as Anambra governor and the only governor of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), will also shoulder the responsibility of rallying the Igbo politically. He has to strive to ensure that APGA grows beyond Anambra in keeping with the original objective of the party.\n\nHis election as the governor of Anambra places enormous responsibility on his shoulders, said Prof. Uzodinma Nwala, president of Alaigbo Development Foundation. We, in ADF expect him to become one of the major rallying-points in the liberation of Anambra state in particular and Igboland in general.\n\nThe idea behind APGAs formation by Chief Chekwas Okorie in 2002, was to have an Eastern oriented platform that would take charge of the region and challenge for power at the national level. It had done a good job of it initially, taking Anambra eventually in 2006, the year Obi reclaimed his 2003 mandate, and with Ojukwu, a widely respected figure in the Southeast as its founding figure, it looked poised to do exploits.\n\nIn the same 2003, its governorship candidate in Enugu State, Mr. Ugochukwu Agbala, was widely popular and was only denied victory by then governor, Chimaroke Nnamani, who deployed state power apparatus in the most brutal manner to retain his seat. And in 2011, it took Imo State, with Rochas Okorocha as candidate.\n\nHowever, its fortunes quickly went downhill, not helped by Ojukwu\u2019s death in 2011, Okorochas decision to abandon it in 2013 to join the emergent All Progressive Congress, and subsequent uninspiring mercantile leadership that emerged following the ouster of Okorie as national chairman did not help its fortunes.\n\nToday, nearly 20 years on, APGA\u2019s dream appears closer to evaporation than actualisation. And turning this story around, especially as the country prepares for another general election in 2023, is a responsibility that has fallen on the shoulders of Soludo.\n\n\u201cJune made it 20 years since APGA was formed and that\u2019s quite an age for a political party in Nigeria, said Chief Okorie. \u201cSo at 20, I will say that APGA is not at the level it should be. It is not even in total control of Anambra state; it is just in control of the executive and a substantial part of the state assembly. The national assembly is in the hands of other parties and that is not an enviable record.\u201d\n\nOkorie who was forced out of the party, following a protracted leadership rift with Chief Victor Umeh, noted that the plan he had for it, has failed to materialize.\n\n\u201cIf I was asked 20 years ago, where I thought the party would be today, I would have said it will be the ruling party in Nigeria today, because it was supposed to be growing in leaps and bounds. If in the first attempt, we got Anambra State which was 2003, the chances were so bright. We would have done far better in subsequent elections.\u201d\n\nObi, and Obiano, who should have succeeded Ojukwu as the party\u2019s leader, failed to live up the responsibility. Hawks took charge, and on account of mercantile posture of successive leadership, the party departed from its original mandate of being a rallying point for Ndigbo, to become like most other political platforms, a place where positions went to highest bidders.\n\nThe consequence of which is the alienation of many who had invested their emotions to it, including the Southeast street which initially saw it, especially with Ojukwu as a leading figure, as a platform for the rekindling of Biafra spirit.\n\nSoludo\u2019s emergence as governor, represents another opportunity to relaunch the party, a project he has promised to undertake.\n\nSpeaking in a chat with Arise TV after his victory in November, he pledged that APGA under his leadership is going to work very hard to drive popularity in other parts of the country, and that it should not be categorised as a regional party, as it will soon spread across that country.\n\nThe governor-elect had emphasized that APGA will mainstream our neo-progressivism and get Nigerians to buy into its ideas and begin to flood into the party, while noting that APGA will leverage on its bases in some parts of the country to build a systematic approach to getting the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won elections sporadically in some parts of the country but we are now going to build on that to really have a systematic approach to getting the rest of the country.\n\nSoludos commitment will be refreshing to hear for many who had watched the party stagnate in the hands of leaders who saw no need to actively drive it beyond its original enclave.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a vision that Okorie welcomes with open arms, and says he is readily available to help relaunch the platform and drive the project, even as he is full of confidence in Soludo\u2019s ability to make a difference.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that Professor Soludo will make a difference in APGA in many ways, both in rebuilding the party and delivering good governance in Anambra State,\u201d Okorie said.\n\n\u201cMy confidence stems from the fact that from the time Soludo left the Central Bank as governor and became more involved in politics, he has been paying attention to events in Ohanaeze, and has been given assignments.\u201d\n\nComing down to the real business of governing, Anambra is a potential industrial hub and Soludo now has the responsibility of making this a reality. Again, his commitment in this regard has warmed many hearts.\n\nHaving already promised to leverage his international connections to transform Anambra, Soludo, while addressing the transition committee few days ago, made a resounding pledge to, as a matter of policy, support local industries, beginning from wearing local fabrics known as Akwete and using Innoson Vehicles as official car.\n\n\u201cMy Akwete dress is not just a dress, its a statement. I want to make a statement with it. You know, in the entire South-East, this is the only textile thing alive, and its hand-made, by the women of Akwaete in Abia State,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIgbo land is one and we must protect it. We want to bring back the zeal of patronizing our own. I have said it even during campaigns, and I meant it, that if I win, the official car of the governor of Anambra State will be Innoson motors.\n\n\u201cThe dresses I will wear are those made in our place here. We must protect the things that are made in our place. Something is about to happen in Igboland, and together we will get there.\u201d\n\nOne of the major factors in former governor, Obis success was prudence. He shunned the flamboyance of public office and awarded contracts to core professionals. Its a road Soludo has promised to travel much the elation of his admirers. The governor-elect also noted during his remarks fortnight ago, that his swearing-in would be no fanfare, just as not a Kobo would be spent on it.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe day was simply his first day at work, and even though it is a weekend, he would spend eight hours of the day working. I have made a wish that not even one Kobo of Anambra people\u2019s money will be spent on that swearing-in ceremony. It is a wish, and I mean it.\n\n\u201cWhat are we spending money on? Just a few people coming to the inauguration and witnessing it, then I will open office and get down to work immediately.\n\n\u201cI do not wish any event, dancers or players and all that. I just want to show up for work, like every first workday. Though it is going to be a Friday, which is the weekend, I\u2019m going to work for over eight hours that day.\n\n\u201cNo ceremony, no event, no party, nothing. Not even 10 Kobo will be spent. So the people who are saying N20 million has been budgeted should go and tell us where they will get that money. It is going to be work, work, work, and that is what we epitomize.\u201d\n\nThe governor-in-wait has also rejected His Excellency title, and opted for Mr. Governor or Charlie Nwangbafor, noting that people will have to learn to call him by his name. I was called his excellency a while ago, but may I plead that that excellency tag should please wait for now. That is part of what we will discuss in this committee.\n\n\u201cYou may just need to learn how to call me by my name, but if that isn\u2019t good for you, then, may I request that you simply call me Charlie Nwangbafor (Charles son of Mgbafor).\n\nIf that one is so difficult for you that you must be formal in addressing me, then you can address me as Mr. Governor.\u201d",

          "title": "Placing Ngwadom Family Claims Properly In Mbubu Amiri Ezeship Context",
          "text": "Ephraim .C. Okafor\n\nIn the context of this discuss as it regards the subject of Appointment by the Colonial Masters of persons as Warrant Chiefs and its implications in the traditional Igbo society using the current Ezeship imbroglio in Mbubu-Amiri, note should be taken that Igbo kingship institutions developed from three notable sources. The first is indigenous and ancient priesthood, which traditionally combined clerical and political duties of leaders in the village-based republics.\n\nEzes were recognized in Arochukwu, Awka, Nri-Igbo, Owere, Northern Nsukka and Ngwa \u2013 the most populous Igbo sub-group. In Ngwa, Josaiah Ndubuisi Wachuku was Eze from ancestral, royal lineage. Enugu-Ezike, Ovoko, and Iheakpu-Awka are home to the Igbo-Eze communities. The King is variously referred to as Eze or Ezeikpe, depending on lineage. Secondly, the neighboring Benin Empireimposed certain conventions by colonizing certain parts of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to an opposite view, the Eze of Nri influenced the constitution of the Benin Oba\u2019s status. Differing points of view are focused particularly on the communities of Asaba, Onitsha, and Oguta. According to some scholars who argue against what is known as the Afigbo and Omenka Thesis on Origin, Igbo kings of these places trace the historical roots of their investiture immediately to the Oba of Benin. They tend to be called Obi as royal title of honour.\n\nThe third source of Igbo kingship is believed to be 19th and 20th century colonial rule by the British. Under a policy of indirect rule, the colonial administration created \u201cwarrant chiefs,\u201d selecting recognised individuals to serve as administrators, rulers, judges and tax collectors. Native to their communities, warrant chiefs were usually selected from among those men who were most cooperative with the colonial administration, who were passionate about their people and of great sound mind and reputation.\n\nAfter Nigeria gained its constitutional independence from Britain on Saturday 1 October 1960, many of those warrant chiefs maintained their status by seeking to recast their political roles.They clamoured to be among traditional rulers and were collectively retained by government of independent Nigeria vis a vis Igbo Eastern Nigeria, epecially in cases where there were no divergent views and stiff opposition.\n\nThe above has direct correlation with the current incident in Mbubu Amiri kingship tussle where the irreducible truth being that Ngwadom Okorie satisfied the Traditional \u201cAptitude Test\u201d in that being from Amapu village and also Ngwadom family that calls itself first in Amapu village, he succeedingly became the Traditional Head of Amiri which in our Igbo Traditional rulership system was refered to as Eze Amiri.\n\nIn his capacity and disposition as Eze Amiri he presided over cases most profoundly proven by the official records with Ugwu Apali ( Orlu). His appointment as Warrant chief sometime around 1912 empowered him to carry out judicial functions reserved for any Eze anywhere in the whole of Eastern Nigerian and his complementary roles as Warrant chief helped cement his Ezeship roles.\n\nTo further buttress the fact that he was the Village Head cum Eze Mbubu Amiri, his colleagues all from the 9 (Nine) villages that made up Amiri clan namely Ogbennaya Ikerioke Amaokpara, Nwire Oloziriuwa-Nchoko, Obilom Okwudaa- Umuduru, Eleghasim Nwanjaba- Ugbeke, Nnadiawuke Orusakwe- Mbubu, Ogbeama Irechukwu Ubahazu, Amaukwu Agwubuo-Amuka, Ojibe Esionwu- Umudioka,Agupuruonye Okoroji- Isiorie and Ogujiofo Durumbaegbu-Umuecheta.- due to his gravity and fearlessness \u2013 these men appointed him, Eze Ngwadom Okorie, to represent the entire Amiri Clan when the Whitemen came.\n\nWith this, it is safe and sacrosanct to add here that Eze Ngwadom Okorie was the first Eze of Amiri clan. This is archived and can be found at National Archive Enugu. There was harmony not until 1979 when Imo state government created State Council of Chiefs and demanded communities to present to it names of their Ezes. The entire Amiri gathered on the instance of Dr. Okechukwu Okibedi, who just started his tenure as Deputy Speaker Imo State House of Assembly.\n\nThere emerged for the first time controversies as to whom Amiri would send his name. As of this moment, Sylvester Okafor was the chairman of Amiri Community Council, a position Grand father to Prof. Ekelekamchukwu Ngwadom, Nathaniel Ibenyenwa Ngwadom appointed him in 1977 in his powers and authority as the traditional head of Amiri community. The said Sylvester Okaforwas nominated and his name sent as Eze Amiri. His name was subsequently gazetted to that effect.\n\nBut prior to this exercise, Chief Elugwe Unagwu from Amuka had moved a motion that Ngwadom should be sent to Owerri to represent Amiri. Chief Nicholas Oguejiofor from Umuecheta objected, with the claim that Umuecheta is the first son of Amiri. Chief Paul Ogbeama argued that Amiri should send one of their sons who has money as their representative. He acknowledged Eze Ngwadom as the Head of all Amiri chiefs but he does not have money.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of contributing money for projects in Amiri. We want an Amiri son who will be able to do things for us with his money when government calls upon us,\u201d he said. He went ahead to nominate Sylvester Okafor, a business man based in Onitsha. At that, the meeting ended in stalemate.\n\nThe chairman of Amiri Development Union, Mr. Gerald Ubazi adjourned the meeting to July 1978 for possible truce. On that date, the ADU set up a Chieftaincy Committee which developed a new constitution that changed the Ezeship from being \u201cHereditary\u201d to being \u201cRotational\u201d but made the ten village heads as Hereditary or Permanent.\n\nFor instance, since Ubahazu has nominated Sylvester Okafor, because he had money, they still live in the Ogebama family as hereditary, because Ogbeama is one of the Ngwadom kingmakers. Within these stretch of time, Sylvester was coming to Prof. Ekelekamchukwu\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house telling him that he was not interested in contesting the Ezeship with him i.e. Nathanial Ngwadom.\n\nHe was said to have admonished him that if he was not interested why not step aside!!. Dr. Okechukwu Okedibe former deputy speaker Imo House of Assembly, can attest to this event. The details were well captured in the book \u201cHistory of Amiri\u201d (Ngwadom E.). It is never true that Nathaniel Ngwadom or anyone from their family voluntarily handed off the throne to anyone. The matter was unresolved.\n\nThe Amiri chieftaincy committee retained the permanency of Ezeship in the ten villages as \u201d Hereditary\u201d \u2026constitution drafting committee which Chief Alphonsus Efelemegide Ngwadom the father of Prof. Ekelekamchukwu Ngwadom, was even signatory to. It is noteworthy that Ngwadom family has been the figure head of Mbubu people and for thishas relentlessly, righteously, laid claim to the Ezeship of the Mbubu Amiri.\n\nIf Amiri Chieftaincy Committee constitution recommendations mean anything to Amiri people and the words of those elders can stand the test of time, the Hereditary clause enshrined in that document for village heads in which Ngwadom is the one\n\nin Mbubu, any argument of rotation in the newly created Mbubu Autonomous Community does not hold water.\n\nit is also a historical fact buttressing the immutable claims of the Ngwadoms of being the undisputed head of Amiri. In 2006, one of the uncle of Prof. Ekelekamchukwu Ngwadom had visited his father for the purpose of the Mbubu people applying for an autonomous community with Prof.\u2019s father as the traditional ruler. Cyril Ugochukwu Uzoukwu admitted he would not want to be Eze. He avowed his support to Alphonsus Ngwadoms and bemoaned how Amiri people have been treating him.\n\nHis seemingly kind expressions only reminded Alphonsus Ngwadom the way and manners his father Chief Wilfred Uzoukwu supported his (Ngwadom\u2019s) own father then. He( Ngwadom) suggested to them of the need to add Amaokpara to Mbubu to read Amambu autonomous community. Chief Stephen Ike and his brother Edwin Ikerioke were consulted. They agreed and stated that as far as Ngwadom shall be Eze there won\u2019t be any issues.\n\nA few people from Amaokpara raised objections demanding that it should be rotatory with Ngwadom being the Eze and that after he dies it will come to them. When they noticed that the arrangement didn\u2019t go down well with Mbubu people who insisted on hereditary, they pulled out. Mbubu proceeded with the application for autonomy with Ngwadom as their Eze.\n\nAnother argument emerged from within Mbubu that it should be rotational from family to family. Prof.\u2019s father, Ngwadom Alphonsus disagreed with them citing that Mbubu ezeship is hereditary and not rotational. This is evident when a titled man in Mbubu dies his son will ( Macha agada Eze ya) \u2013 take his place or succeed him. Ngwadom Alphonsus and his supporters from Mbubu successfully applied for an autonomous community. It was granted in 2011.\n\nUnfortunately, on the day of presentation of the certificate, Eze Ngwadom was kidnapped by a group of people led by Mr. Charles Ndobi. They didn\u2019t realize that the certificate was aleady printed. Noticing that they couldnt change the name, they went and reapplied with a non-existent community Mbutu Amiri in Oru West local government.\n\nCyril Uzoukwu has been operating with that document for seven years now until he was apprehended. He claimed it was a mistake in the name; if Mbubu was mispelt as Mbutu in error what about the inclusion of Oru West, instead of Oru East, is it also a mistake?\n\nHon. Barr. Ephraim .C. Okafor, Head of Practice, E.C. Okafor01&Co.(Okemuo Chambers).",
          "summary": "In his capacity and disposition as Eze Amiri he presided over cases most profoundly proven by the official records with Ugwu Apali ( Orlu).\nWith this, it is safe and sacrosanct to add here that Eze Ngwadom Okorie was the first Eze of Amiri clan.\nThe details were well captured in the book \u201cHistory of Amiri\u201d (Ngwadom E.).\nIt is noteworthy that Ngwadom family has been the figure head of Mbubu people and for thishas relentlessly, righteously, laid claim to the Ezeship of the Mbubu Amiri.\nUnfortunately, on the day of presentation of the certificate, Eze Ngwadom was kidnapped by a group of people led by Mr. Charles Ndobi.",

          "title": "Equity market: Investors reap N3.1trillion",
          "text": "OKEY ONYENWEAKU\n\nDespite the slowing down or decline by 0.23 per cent of the All share Index (ASI) of the equities sector of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) as at Tuesday 8, 2022, the market has recorded more of bullish trends than otherwise this year.\n\nA critical observation of the activities of equities year to date revealed that the All share index has gained 4,128.12 basis points to 47,154.35 points, representing 9.6 per cent while the market capitalization garnered N2.229trillion, representing 9.6 percent. The growth by the twin major indexes is an evidence of activities, interest and rewards that have accrued from investing in the capital market.\n\nGiven the above data, the market has shown some measure of significant growth in the new year 2022, that is from January 4, 2022 to March 8, 2022.\n\nThis is higher than the 6.07 percent that the equities market returned at the close of business year in 2021and much less than the 53 per cent it returned in 2020.\n\nIn fact, the sub-sectors of the equities market have also recorded good advances. For instance, NGX Premium Index appreciated by 6.34 per cent, the NGX Banking sub-sector appreciated by 8.2 per cent among others.\n\nHowever, it is not all roses for all the sun sectors; the NGX Insurance and NGX Asem Index declined by 6.4 per cent and 1.73 per cent respectively.\n\nNevertheless, the significant growth has been recorded in the market despite the biting hardship in the country.\n\nWhat is fueling the growth in the equities market?\n\nThere have been mixed reactions as to why the market is surging despite excruciating hardship in the environment.\n\nMost times, a rise in the price of crude has a way of impacting the equities market positively. This is incontrovertible given that the country reaps more revenue which trickles down even to drag up the equities market.\n\nAnalysts also reckon that investors are more likely to take position when stock prices are low. They observed that the devaluation of the naira makes our stocks cheaper for investors both internal and foreign who want to increase their stake in some companies.\n\nOn the flip side, however, analysts believe that the hardship which has pervaded the environment is weighty enough to impede the sustainability of the bullish market trend.\n\nThere is also some consensus that the Russia/ Ukraine war has already started affecting markets negatively, and the Nigerian equities market is not an exception.\n\nSince the day the war started on February 24, 2022, the All share Index which stood at 47,328.42 points on February 25, 2022 dropped by 41.33 points or 0.08 per cent to close at 47,287.09 points on March 9,2022. But some still argue that the oil windfall is which price has hit $125 pbd is rather a course to Nigeria presently given that more is being spent to import fuel now and more will be spent on subsidy there by depleting our revenues more dangerously.\n\nFor the CEO of NGX, Mr. Temi Popoola, the 2021 Finance Act has brought a lot more clarity on investment streams such as the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Securities Lending transactions.\n\n\u201cParticipating in real estate investments brings in a lot of potential gain, If you look at our market today, all of our assets classes have helped to boost investors confidence,\u201d he said.\n\nPopoola also stated that the introduction of the capital gains tax on transactions over 100 million naira is a welcome development, and in line with the governments drive towards an increased tax bracket.\n\nBut he noted however that the policy might have the adverse effect of discouraging high-end investors including institutional investors.\n\nFrom early 2020, when the Covid -19 pandemic was detected and the attendant lockdowns and disruptions in supply chains among other challenges became rife, the market has had its fair share of the difficulties plunging from the gains of 53 per cent in 2020 to 6.07 per cent in 2021.\n\nThis is besides the high inflation rate which has however tampered from above 18.17 per cent earlier in the year 2021 to 15.6 per cent; high unemployment at more than 33 per cent; underemployment above 22 per cent; and high insecurity caused by the Boko Haram sect, insurgents, kidnappers and bandits.\n\nAt the same time, Nigeria\u2019s diaspora remittances inflow which is set to beat the World Banks projection for 2021, as it rose to $14.2 billion in the nine months ending September 2021, up 10 per cent Year-on-Year, YoY, from $12.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2020, reflecting the impact of post-COVID economic recovery measures, is still recovering.\n\nAlso remarkable is the country\u2019s heavy debt burden at almost N40 trillion and expected to hit N43 trillion and above at the end of 2022 and still growing. Of the budget of N17trillion for 2022, the budget deficit stood at over N6trillion as over 90 per cent of revenues are now used to service debts.\n\nOur most aggressive estimate of FGN revenue in 2022 is about N5 trillion. This means the FGN will need to borrow about N8 trillion in order to finance aggregate spending of N13 trillion. We estimate that the FGN will borrow about $5 billion in foreign currency (FCY) in 2022 (N2.1 trillion) and the rest will be local currency (LCY) borrowings. This will increase FCY borrowings to about US$44 billion and LCY borrowings to about \u20a643 trillion. Said Agusto in a recent report.\n\nMore worrisome is that the country has set a new borrowing limit, up from 25 per cent of GDP to 40 per cent of the GDP. This was contained in the Medium Term Debt Strategy and continues to leave many analysts scratching their heads given that the major revenue earner for the country, crude oil price, which has hit $125 pbd and above presently still fluctuates.\n\nAt the same time, insecurity has not only hobbled agriculture, many parts of Northern Nigeria have been taken over by bandits such that not much business activities can subsist.\n\nThe World Bank just noted that Nigerias revenue to GDP ratio hovered between five and six per cent last year and remains the lowest in the world. These days almost everybody is aware that Nigeria is struggling for the poverty capital of the world title with India with over 100 million people living in poverty. The Naira which exchanged at N220/$ by June 15, 2015 has depreciated by about 100 per cent to N570/$ this March 2022.\n\nThe World Banks projection of Nigerias economic growth by 2.5 per cent remains a far cry from the consensus that the GDP growth of 12 -15 per cent is needed to grow a sustainable economy.\n\nUnfortunately too, FGs projections of attracting FDI of $1.5bn in 2022 to $5bn by 2025 has also raised doubts when the FDI for the year 2021 declined by 32 per cent year on year to a sum of $698.78 million, representing its lowest level on record.\n\nIn his view, Managing Director of High Cap securities limited, Mr. David Adonri said that a lot of factors interact to determine the direction of the market.\n\nHe reckoned that all these factors at the end determine investors choices.\n\n\u201cFortunately, investors usually look more into the future than what is happening at the present. So, notwithstanding the fact that hardship is higher now and that things may have fallen apart.\n\n\u201cBut investors still strongly believe there are some positives to take out of the economy. That is not to say that the market will not at the end of the day react to what is happening because if you look at the current cost of energy both power and fuel you will ultimately see the outcomes would impact the bottom lines of the related companies and you will notice that when they release their results they will not be as good as they were last year. And I believe that at that point the market will begin to react. Again the market is also looking at the rising price of crude oil and I think crude oil price appear to be hitting the roof top.\n\n\u201cBut the down side factors are weighty enough to give concern. This is because these growth may not be sustainable at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, before now, the market had gained 65% in 2003;18.5%in 2004;1.01% in 2005;37.80% in 2006 and 74.73% in 2007. It had in the past also lost -45.77% in 2008 and -33.80% in 2009 before it took a rebound to gain 18.50% in 2010. The market slipped back in the negative by -17% in 2011, gained \u2014 35.4% in 2012, gained 47.19% in 2013, lost by -16.14%. It closed in the negative by -17.36% in 2015, -6.% in 2016, it gained 42.30 per cent in 2017, and closed negative by -17.81 per cent in 2018; it closed at 14.6% negative in 2019; the market gained 50 or 51% in 2020 and gained 6.07% in 2021.",

That you\u2019re sorry, we the members of the public, we don\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nReacting to Wike\u2019s ranting, Umahi, in a statement issued by Francis Nwaze, Special Assistant to the Governor\n\n(Media and Publicity), said he came across a video Wike in which he was quoted as saying that he masterminded the Abuja High Court judgment on him for defecting to the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\n\u201cNot much surprised at the comment though, we would have ignored it as one of his blubberings but it has become imperative we make a few annotations for clarity.\n\n\u201cWike from the statement has taken responsibility for the pronouncement of the Federal High Court, thus requiring that he explains to Nigerians how he now calls the shots in the Nation\u2019s Judiciary without being a Judge.\n\n\u201cWhile we will not get intoxicated and begin to comment on a case that is already pending in a Court of competent jurisdiction like Wike, we like to place it on record that Ebonyi State is not in the same geopolitical Zone with Rivers State and so nothing would have prompted Nyesom Wike to make such unguarded comment about Governor Umahi if he is not a cheeky hatchet job-man.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that Governor Umahi since the legal battle started has conducted himself properly by filing an appeal in a Court of Superior records and did not resort to horse-trading like his counterpart, Nyesom Wike who speaks as if he has the Nigeria Judiciary in his armpit, which is impossible.\n\n\u201cWe are however not unaware that the envy of Nyesom Wike is the earth-shattering accomplishments of the Governor Umahi led administration in Ebonyi State which include but are not limited to over seventeen twin flyovers, State of the art King David University of Medical Sciences, the best of its kind in Africa, the shopping mall, the best International Airport in Nigeria, payment of civil servants, massive empowerment of the youths, widows, clergy and so much more,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement said \u201cwhile not joining issues with the Governor, we like to remind Wike that hence he riggled himself out of the 2015 Appeal Court ruling dismissing him as Governor of Rivers State, Governor Umahi would come out of his current legal issues stronger and unscathed while still proceeding on his presidential ambition gallantly.\n\n\u201cNot minding his looney voice, we want to emphasize that Governor Umahi and Ebonyians have absolute confidence in the Nigeria Judiciary to carry out an unbiased adjudication which would open a new vista of precedence in justice dispensation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe urge Ebonyians and supporters of Governor David Nweze Umahi across the Country and beyond to remain peaceful and resolute lest the likes of Wike and other political desperados score a cheap political point by the reason of their conduct at a time like this.\n\n\u201cWe also enjoin Ebonyi citizens and the reading public to disregard the hapless surmise of a man reputed for orchestration of unhealthy and brutish governance under a Democracy.\u201d",

          "text": "2023: Tambuwal\u2019s Consultations In Northwest Successful\n\nThe consultations by the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, in the North West geo-political zone towards gauging whether or not to aspire to the highest office in the land in 2023 has ended on a successful note.\n\nThe effort which spanned weeks between February and early March 2022 was based on what most people in Sokoto State and, indeed, Nigeria knew and believed about the governor \u2013 his sterling records as Speaker of the House of Representatives, governor of Sokoto State and chairman of Peoples Democratic Party Governors Forum. The exemplary leadership qualities displayed in these offices had lent momentum to a growing clamour for Tambuwal to vie for president.\n\nBefore embarking on the tours to states in the zone \u2013 Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Zamfara and Kaduna, the Sokoto PDP stakeholders had endorsed him to run for president in the next general election. Their central message was that Sokoto State and, certainly, Nigeria could not afford to lose or ignore a winning player in the selection of contestants for the critical political of the president of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\nTambuwal hearkened to the calls and thus embarked on a nationwide consultation to try to figure out how to approach the issue. \u201cI have listened to our party leaders, women, and youths on the call that I should initiate and begin the process of consultation with a view to running and contesting for the president of Nigeria under the banner of our great party,\u201d he told the stakeholders during the meeting held at the PDP state secretariat in Sokoto on January 31, 2022.\n\nThe lawyer and graduate of Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto, began the first leg of the nationwide consultation on February 1 with a visit to Jigawa where he met with former Governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, at his home in Birnin Kudu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nTambuwal was accompanied on the visit by former Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa; Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Gusau; former Deputy Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Mukhtar Shagari; former Minister of Power, Engr. Bello Suleiman; and former chairman of PDP, Alhaji Bello Muhammad.\n\nOthers included former Director, Counterterrorism, in the office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), Gen Sarkin-Yaki Bello, and Hon. Aminu Koko.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s entourage was welcomed at Dutse International Airport by a large and joyous crowd led by Mustapha Sule Lamido, son of their host. The Governor\u2019s motorcade rode at a snail speed for about two hours in a journey that should take less than thirty minutes to Bamaina, Lamido\u2019s town.\n\nIn Bamaina, former Governor Lamido said Tambuwal possessed the track record and national outlook needed to overcome Nigeria\u2019s current challenges, which had been worsened by a worrisome spate of ethnicity and religious division under President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s All Progressives Congress, APC, government.\n\n\u201cOur son here is like me. We have similar and parallel positions in government,\u201d he said of Tambuwal.\n\nLamido said he looked forward to seeing Tambuwal on the country\u2019s highest political seat, emphasizing that he is eminently qualified to run for the highest office in the land.\n\nHe described Tambuwal as a \u201cpan Nigerian that will be just,\u201d and that Nigerians need him to put the country back on the path of peace, progress, and harmony.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe can reach out to all Nigerians across the geographic and other divides in our bid to support him.\n\n\u201cThis does not suggest that we are beggars hungry for power. Instead, we are worthy stakeholders with friends in many parts of the country who we can persuade to see reason with us in the realisation of the Nigerian project.\u201d\n\nFormer Governor Bafarawa thanked Lamido for receiving Tambuwal and his entourage. \u201cYou are not just a former governor but a great political mobiliser whose people still respect and follow, despite the fact that you have been out of office for almost seven years now,\u201d he said.\n\nA week after, Tambuwal and his entourage were in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, and was to a rousing welcome by Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Mahdi Aliyu Gasau, as well as the state PDP leader, including the state chairman.\n\nIn his speech, Tambuwal sympathized with the people of the state over the insecurity that had claimed many lives, and stressed that it was imperative for leaders of PDP in the state to close ranks so as to take over Nigeria and Zamfara State in the 2023 general election, saying that the rollback of the fortunes of the PDP in leading Nigeria and Zamfara State will soon be over.\n\nHis words: \u201cIf we succeed in our bid, the country will witness a reversal of the current bad fortunes.\u201d\n\nDeputy Governor Gusau, in his remarks, said he was solidly behind Governor Tambuwal\u2019s Presidential ambition and urged him to carry the entire Zamfara PDP along in his quest to become Nigeria\u2019s President next year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no turning in our determination to back him all the way,\u201d Gusau said, while listing the sterling political credentials of Tambuwal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next day, Tambuwal\u2019s consultative train moved to Kebbi State. The entourage was accorded rousing welcome by the Kebbi State PDP leaders and members, including the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Ibrahim Abdullahi; former Minister for Special Duties, Alhaji Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (SAN); former Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Ishaya Rinzi Bamaiyi (rtd); former Director of Counterterrorism in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), Gen. Sarkin-Yaki Bello; former General Officer Commanding 8 Division, Sokoto, Gen. Aminu Bande; and former National Women Leader of the PDP, Hajiya Maryam Waziri.\n\nWelcoming Tambuwal, former acting National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Bello Halliru Muhammad, said Nigeria needs a competent, trustworthy and courageous leader, like Tambuwal.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria is in bad shape after years of (misrule) by President Muhammadu Buhari. The country has never been so divided along ethnic and religious affiliations like now. If a worthy person doesn\u2019t take over (Nigeria) risks breaking apart.\u201d\n\nThe Kebbi State PDP Chairman, Alhaji Bello Usman Suru, in his own remarks, gave an unequivocal endorsement of Tambuwal for President and pledged the unalloyed support of Kebbi PDP. Suru said: \u201cHistorically, we in Kebbi are one with the people of Sokoto. You don\u2019t need to campaign here. All the state delegates, chairmen of local government wings and members of the executives in the state will vote for you.\n\n\u201cWhen it is time to decide who becomes our party\u2019s Presidential candidate, we may exceed even Sokoto state. I say this because there may be some black legs in Sokoto, but here we are behind you one hundred per cent.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Tambuwal said: \u201cThe PDP in Kebbi state is united. The PDP in Kebbi state is compact and strong. I appeal to you to work together as a family to attract more members from the opposition because there is a lot of trouble in the other house.\n\n\u201cI know they will leave and come here. When they come, I implore you to be very magnanimous so that when they come, you should be accommodating and carry everybody along, so that together, God willing, we shall win the elections here in Kebbi State and in Nigeria come 2023.\u201d\n\nTambuwal also spoke on the state of the nation, lamenting \u201cNigeria was on the verge of collapse as a result of insecurity, debilitating healthcare system, poverty, falling standard of education, corruption and other ills that have become the hallmark of the APC administration thus far.\u201d\n\nWhen the train got to Katsina, Tambuwal and his team met PDP leaders and stakeholders and pleaded for unity among party members, adding that it would be easier to reclaim power from the ruling APC with a united front.\n\nWhile pledging an all-inclusive government that will bring back hope to Nigerians if elected President, Tambuwal said Nigeria had \u201cnever been this divided with several agitations and insecurity at a very alarming level.\u201d\n\nHe therefore said reclaiming \u201cpower from the APC is a must to save the nation from the current decay.\u201d\n\nThe team also had a whistle-stop in Kaduna, where Tambuwal visited former Governor Ahmed Makarfi. Here, the presidential hopeful emphasized the need for unity in the party as a precondition for reclaiming power from the APC.\n\nHe, however, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to follow the footsteps of former President Goodluck Jonathan by bequeathing free, fair and credible election on the nation in 2023.\n\nHe also counseled the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to conduct free, fair and credible elections and thus leave a lasting legacy for himself. He said: \u201cAs I said before, the head of the electoral umpire \u2013 the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu has only one option. That option is to leave a lasting legacy. From my knowledge, he is from a very good family background.\n\n\u201cSo, he needs to actually make sure that he did not soil that his family history and his own personal history by ensuring he conduct a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nA party stalwart said the impressive retinue of leaders and supporters that accompanied Tambuwal and those that received him in the states in the North West geo-political zone he traversed has demonstrated the quality of endorsement he has secured at home so far and hopes this will translate into a broader national appeal.",

It hinged its decision on the unseriousness of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cNEC, having taken reports on the engagements of the Trustees and Principal Officers with the Government, concluded that Government had failed to satisfactorily address all the issues raised in the 2020 FGN/ASUU Memorandum of Action (MoA) within the four-week roll\u2014over strike period and resolved that the strike be rolled over for another eight (8) weeks to give Government more time to address all the issues in concrete terms so that our students will resume as soon as possible,\u201d a statement by ASUU\u2019s president, Emmanuel Osodeke, read.\n\n\u201cThe roll-over strike shall commence by 12.01 am on Monday, 14 March 2022.\u201d\n\nASUU blamed its decision on the insincerity of the government since it started the warning strike a month ago. According to the lecturers, a series of meetings with government officials yielded nothing.\n\n\u201cNEC viewed Government\u2019s response, so far, as a continuation of the unconscionable, mindless, and nonchalant attitude of the Nigerian ruling elite towards the proven path of national development which is education,\u201d ASUU said.\n\nRELATED\n\nASUU Strike: FG Gives Committee Three Months To Renegotiate With Union\n\nStrikes: Call ASUU To Order, FG Tells NLC\n\nUnfair Evaluation?\n\nThe recent strike is due to grievances over the Federal Government\u2019s failure to fulfill a 2020 agreement reached with the varsity teachers.\n\nIn the wake of the industrial action, there were accusations and counter-accusations from both parties, one of the contentious issues being the government\u2019s rejection of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), developed to replace the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS).\n\nUTAS, the Federal Government claimed, did not pass a series of tests it conducted to check its reliability. But ASUU dismissed the claims, saying the government was not fair in its evaluation.\n\n\ufeff\n\nIrked by the development, students protested across the nation and called for a reopening of campuses.\n\nA meeting between officials of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and the Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, ended with the minister walking out on them.\n\nWhile the ASUU strike lingers, members of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), are also threatening to down tools over agreements reached with the union.",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Moves to Retain Buni as Interim Chairman, Bello as Acting Chair",
          "text": "In a dramatic turn of events, leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have agreed to keep Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as Interim Chairman of the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), while Niger State Governor Sani Bello functions as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity while Buni remains away.\n\nBuni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as the CECPC chairman. It was gathered on Sunday that the party is maintaining the letter of transition remains in force even as Buni remains interim caretaker chairman.\n\nHowever, it is not clear what they would ultimately do with Buni, as there is a move by some party stakeholders to have him impeached. Also, the fate of the CECPC Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe remains uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out.\n\nJust last weekend, as part of intense lobby going on in the ruling party, former leaders of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) stormed London, where President Muhammadu Buhari is currently undergoing routine medical check-up, to persuade him to give more room to members of CPC,, one of the legacy parties that merged to form the APC before the 2015 general election, claiming they have been thoroughly marginalised in the scheme of things.\n\nInterestingly, according to observers \u201ccentral London Mosque, was overtaken by Nigerians, including ministers, governors, and many high net worth people, during Friday jumat prayers. As politicians have flown to London to lobby the President ahead of 2023 elections..\u201d\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Buni officially remains the interim CECPC chair as he was never legally removed in the first place, and since he transmitted a letter to Bello to act in his absence, that automatically confers his powers on Bello. And Bello would continue in his acting role which by implication means he would be carrying out the day to day running of the party. Meanwhile some of Buni\u2019s supporters believe he may return to the country this week while others want him to remain abroad until after the convention.\n\nThe Party\u2019s National Convention slated for March 26, THISDAY learnt will hold as planned.\n\nReliable sources in the presidency disclosed these yesterday, stressing that only a properly constituted National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can remove the Buni-led CECPC.\n\nBello had announced a few days ago that he had taken over affairs at the APC national headquarters, disclosing that he was acting as Chairman in the absence of Buni.\n\nHe has called a NEC a meeting which INEC said was out of order because the letter was not signed by Chairman Buni and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn the turn of event the President\u2019s Legal Adviser may have appealed to him to allow Buni remain as interim chair while Bello continues as acting chairman.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, some of the president\u2019s associates noted that by the framework of the Party\u2019s NEC, Buni was never removed as CECPC chairman. \u201cYou cannot even be talking of return, when he was never removed, in the first place,\u201d a presidency source said.\n\nThe alleged removal of Buni had unsettled the party, causing division among APC governors and top stakeholders, with some alleging that the Yobe State governor was plotting to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nWhile some expressed satisfaction with the development, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of the party\u2019s NEC, where Bello\u2019s chairmanship was to be ratified.\n\nWhat has become apparent is that majority of the governors, in their bid to oust Buni by all means, failed to reckon with INEC. They thought they had succeeded, well, almost, and they had started to celebrate victory, until INEC threw a spanner in the works.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position, among other issues, led some from Buhari\u2019s inner circle of advisers to meet with him at the weekend.\n\nShedding light on the outcome of the meeting with the president, a source pointed out that Buhari informed those in attendance that his desire was to see that the convention was held as planned. Buhari also wanted to see a smooth, democratic and popular contest that would lead to the birth of a brand new National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, the source said.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe president was persuaded that there was a process that needed to be followed to remove the Buni-led CECPC. The NEC of the party is the highest administrative organ of the party, which takes very important decisions in terms of removal and appointment of the party leadership. Buni was not appointed by an imperial authority with the power remove him.\n\n\u201cSince the decision to appoint him was taken by NEC, it is only NEC that can remove him. So, Buni was never removed, in the first place. Certainly, if he personally withdraws, resigns or a NEC meeting takes place to remove him, then we can be talking about having a new CECPC chairman.\n\n\u201cNone of that has taken place; so the idea of removal does not arise. However, the party may come up with an arrangement to allow for certain processes to take place, particularly relating to conventions.\n\n\u201cBut Buni may decide to take the back seat to allow the convention process to take place, if he does that, then fine. However, the idea of concluding that he has been removed does not arise.\u201d\n\nBuni was blamed for withholding information from Party leaders about a court injunction stopping the party from going ahead with the convention. The Party has since set machinery in motion to have the injunction vacated this week to enable the convention hold.\n\nA faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate so. Apparently miffed by the what he was told, the president was said to have immediately directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\nAnother source at the meeting explained that Buhari was convinced of the need to allow Buni to to continue as interim chairman which the president was said to have accepted to save the party from danger.\n\nThe source also revealed that another contentious issue that was discussed was the president\u2019s purported endorsement of former Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Adamu, for the position of APC National Chairman. There have been intense lobby for the President to drop Adamu and allow for a contested convention. Most of the other aspirants have kicked against the President\u2019s purported endorsement of Abdulahi Adamu. The lobby to drop Adamu was said to have intensified at the weekend as some governors are preparing to jet to London to mount pressure on Buhari to change his mind on Adamu.\n\nBuhari had assured party members before departing the country for his medical trip, that he would do everything to ensure the convention holds as scheduled on March 26.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress Youth Development and Solidarity Network (APC-YDSN) has alleged fresh plot by some APC Governors to get a court injunction to effectively sack Buni as CECPC Chairman.\n\nThe Secretary General, Mr. Tobias Ogbeh, made this allegation while addressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe group said after the failed leadership change in the party, there had been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\n\nThe group stated: \u201cAs we may be aware, some governors within the party have attempted to change the leadership of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cAs despicable as this might sound, there has been an attempt at effecting a change in the leadership of the party, not on the strength of the interest of the party, but in furtherance of a blind ambition towards taking over the party structure through the back door in the buildup to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that we have it on good authority that since the humiliation suffered by the sponsors of the failed leadership change in the party, there have been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\u201d\n\nThe group warned judges and other officers in the legal profession to refuse to be used as pawns to truncate the democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\nThe group informed all APC stakeholders and members of the general public that part of the new plot was to secure a court judgement through the back door that would sack the party\u2019s leadership from office.\n\nThe scheme, the group alleged, was heavily funded by a serving minister and presidential aspirant from the south.\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the general public to be on the watch as the manifestation of this plot would gather steam soonest.\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
